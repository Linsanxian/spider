The ultra wide bandwidth offers pulses with very short duration that provides frequency diversity and multipath resolution. UWB OFDM communication is proposed for physical layer in the IEEE 802.15.3a standard which covers wideband communication for wireless personal area networks (WPANs). Channel estimation is very important for OFDM based UWB system because of its coherent demodulation and channel is time varying. This paper proposes a new blind adaptive channel estimation technique based on orthogonal iteration method for UWB OFDM communication. The channel parameters are adaptively estimated in the proposed method which is based on recursive least square method. The proposed method distinguishes itself from many previously reported channel estimation methods by eliminating the training bits, thereby increasing the channel efficiency. The proposed method is compared with LS based blind channel estimation method in various aspects by computer simulations.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/91/C4/15/91C4158883340D5EFC5816E5EDC38BC7.pdf

To cope with high complexity, increasing memory requirements, and lack of tracking capability that batch Lasso estimators face when processing observations sequentially, the present paper develops a novel time-weighted Lasso (TWL) approach. Performance analysis reveals that TWL cannot estimate consistently the desired signal support without compromising rate of convergence. This motivates the development of a time- and norm-weighted Lasso (TNWL) scheme with l1-norm weights obtained from the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm. The resultant algorithm consistently estimates the support of sparse signals without reducing the convergence rate. To cope with sparsity-aware recursive real-time processing, novel adaptive algorithms are also developed to enable online coordinate descent solvers of TWL and TNWL that provably converge to the true sparse signal in the time-invariant case. Simulated tests compare competing alternatives and corroborate the performance of the novel algorithms in estimating time-invariant signals, and tracking time-varying signals under sparsity constraints.",,

In many real-world scenarios, the environments are complex and dynamic, in which the performance of traditional RL approaches may drastically degrade. One of the factors which results in the dynamicity and complexity of the environment is a change in the position and number of obstacles. This paper presents a path planning approach for autonomous mobile robots in a complex dynamic indoor environment, where the dynamic pattern of obstacles will not drastically affect the performance of RL models. Two independent modules, collision avoidance without considering the goal position and goal-seeking without considering obstacles avoidance, are trained independently using artificial neural networks and RL to obtain their best control policies. Then, a switching function is used to combine the two trained modules for realizing the obstacle avoidance and global path planning in a complex dynamic indoor environment. Furthermore, this control system is designed with a special focus on the computational and memory requirements of resource-constrained robots. The design was tested in a real-world environment on a mini-robot with constrained resources. Along with the static and dynamic obstacles' avoidance, this system has the ability to achieve both static and dynamic targets. This control system can also be used to train a robot in the real world using RL when the robot cannot afford to collide. Robot behavior in the real ground shows a very strong correlation with the simulation results.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/54/EB/14/54EB14973A61A0E607FB16100FBAC1BD.pdf

The directional changes as well as the smoothing mechanism can be explained by the diagenetic magnetite formation model (Van Hoof et al., 1992) in which shortly after burial, the remanence carried by newly formed secondary magnetites is superposed on the initial remanence carried by primary magnetite.",,

The integrated stratigraphy of the Rossello composite section of Hilgen ([1], Newslett. Stratigr., 17, 1987) is thereby completed. This composite section provides an unprecedented high-quality reference section for the Early to early Late Pliocene, containing a continuous sequence ranging from below the Thvera Subchron into the Matuyama Chron (4.86-2.45 Ma). The Punta di Maiata section extends from the Sidufjall Subchron of the Gilbert into the Gauss Chron (4.50-3.30 Ma). Linear interpolation between paleomagnetic datum planes in this section yields first-order age estimates of 3.72 (+/- 0.01) and 3.59 (+/- 0.01) Ma for the last common occurrence (LCO) and the actual last occurrence (LO) of Globorotalia margaritae. In addition, this age of 3.59 Ma provides an accurate age for the Zanclean-Piacenzian (Z/P) boundary, provided the LO of G. margaritae is maintained as a criterion to define this boundary in the Mediterranean. Irrespective, however, of the criterion used, the Punta di Maiata and Punta Piccola subsections of the Rossello composite are at present the most suitable sections to be designated as stratotypes for the Z/P boundary. The global significance of the Rossello composite is further strongly enhanced by the establishment of an astronomically calibrated geomagnetic polarity time scale based on the correlation of the Trubi sedimentary cycles with the astronomical record.",,

This episode is characterized by the presence of two stratigraphic markers: a) Dark grey shales and siltstones (""Black Pelites""), considered previously as the northern closure of the Gorno-Lower S. Giovanni Bianco Fms., but re-interpreted as the western pinch-out of the Lozio Shale depositional system. The Early Carnian Lozio Shale was deposited first in the Valle di Scalve-Lozio trough and later covered the carbonate platform (Breno Fin.). b) Fossiliferous, open subtidal limestones, marls and burrowed marly limestones (""Bioclastic Horizon"") of the northern Bergamasc Alps. The spreading of shales and siltstones represents the first transgressive stage of the last Carnian sequence in Lombardy, after the ""mid- Carnian"" (Julian substage) regional carbonate platform crisis (top of the Valcamonica Breno Fm.). The ""Bioclastic Horizon"" records the mfs represented by normal, open marine facies, identified and correlated throughout the Bergamasc Alps. Different petrographic and chemical characters between the Lozio Shale - ""Black Pelites"" and the Gorno-San Giovanni Bianco Fms. suggest different source areas: the former units are characterized by clasts derived from a metamorphic-intrusive area (placed northward and westward), whereas the latter units are characterized by prevailing volcaniclastic material. A climatic change (from and to relatively humid conditions) may be invoked to explain the crisis of the ""mid-Carnian"" carbonate platforms in the western Southern Alps and the regional spreading of fine-grained terrigenous material.",,

An important class of generalized CRF-structures on an odd dimensional manifold M consists of CRF-structures having complementary frames of the form ξ ± η, where ξ is a vector field and η is a 1-form on M with η(ξ) = 1. It turns out that these kinds of CRF-structures give rise to a special class of what we called strong generalized contact structures in Poon and Wade [5]. More precisely, we show that to any CRF-structures with complementary frames of the form ξ ± η, there corresponds a canonical Lie bialgebroid. Finally, we explain the relationship between generalized contact structures and another generalization of the notion of a Cauchy–Riemann structure on a manifold. © 2010 Académie des sciences.

Vaisman a montré que cette définition d’une F -structure généralisée est équivalente à la donnée d’un endomorphisme de fibrés Φ : T M ⊕ T ∗M → T M ⊕ T ∗M tel que Φ +Φ∗ = 0 et Φ3 +Φ = 0 (voir [6]). Si en outre, l’espace des sections de E est stable pour le crochet de Courant, alors E est appelé une structure CRF généralisée [6]. Cette notion généralise à la fois les F -structures et les structures de Cauchy–Riemann classiques. Nous nous intéressons aux F -structures généralisées Φ définies sur une variété lisse M de dimension impaire munie de sections globales ξ ± η, où ξ est un champ de vecteurs et η est une 1-forme tels que η(ξ) = 1 sur M . Le couple (Φ, ξ + η) est appelé une F -structure généralisée avec supplémentaires orthogonaux (voir [6]). Deux couples (Φ, ξ + η) et (Φ ′, ξ ′ + η′) sont dits équivalents s’il existe une fonction f qui ne s’annule en aucun point de M et telle que : η′ = f η, ξ ′ = f ξ , Φ ′ = Φ. Définition 0.1. Une structure presque de contact généralisée sur M est la donnée d’une classe d’équivalence de tels couples (Φ, ξ + η). Toute F -structure généralisée Φ peut être représentée par une matrice dont les quatre blocs carrés sont φ : T M → T M, π : T ∗M → T M , θ : T M → T ∗M et −φ∗ : T ∗M → T ∗M , où φ est un tenseur de type (1,1), π est un champ de bi-vecteurs et θ est une 2-forme sur M . Donc une structure presque de contact généralisée n’est rien d’autre qu’une classe d’équivalence de tenseurs (φ,π, θ, ξ,η) verifiant des conditions de compatibilité (voir les relations (3), (4) et (5) ci-dessous). Considérons une structure de contact généralisée sur M représentée par le quintuplet (φ,π, θ, ξ,η) et définissons les fibrés vectoriels complexes : E = {e − iΦ(e) ∣∣ e ∈ kerη ⊕ ker ξ} et E = {e + iΦ(e) ∣∣ e ∈ kerη ⊕ ker ξ}. Soit Lξ le complexifié du fibré réel de rang 1 engendré par ξ et L = Lξ ⊕ E . Les fibrés vectoriels complexes E , E , L et L sont indépendants du choix du représentant dans une classe d’équivalence fixée. Toute structure presque de contact généralisée sur M dont le fibré associé L est intégrable (c’est-à-dire, l’espace Γ (L) des sections de L est stable pour le crochet de Courant) est simplement appelée une structure de contact généralisée. Si L et L∗ sont simultanément intégrables alors la structure de contact généralisée est dite forte. A priori, l’intégrabilité de L n’implique pas celle de E(1,0) . Cependant, nous montrons que la réciproque est vraie. Par ailleurs, étant donnée une structure de contact généralisée sur M , le couple (L, L∗) de fibrés vectoriels complexes associés détermine toujours un quasi-bialgébroïde de Lie, qui n’est pas nécessairement un bialgébroïde de Lie. Il est tout à fait naturel de se demander la question suivante : l’intégrabilité de E implique-t-elle que (L, L∗) est un bi-algébroïde de Lie ? L’étude de cette question a mené au résultat suivant : Théorème 0.2. Étant donnée une structure CRF généralisée Φ avec supplémen-taires orthogonaux ξ ± η, le couple (L, L∗) de fibrés associés détermine un bi-algébroïde de Lie au dessus de M. En combinant le théorème précédent avec le Théorème 2.7 de [5], nous obtenons le corollaire ci-dessous. Nous renvoyons le lecteur à [5] pour plus de détails. Corollaire 0.3. Pour toute structure CRF généralisée Φ avec supplémentaires orthogonaux ξ ± η, dη est de type (1,1) par rapport au tenseur Φ défini sur (kerη ⊕ ker ξ) ⊗ C. Nous montrons aussi que les structures de contact généralisées sont des F -structures au sens de Vaisman [6] et celles qui sont fortes sont des structures CRF . Par ailleurs, les structures de contact généralisées fortes donnent des structures de Cauchy–Riemann généralisées au sens de Li-Bland. 1. Generalized CRF-structures with complementary frames Let M be a smooth manifold. The space Γ (T M ⊕ T ∗M) of sections of the vector bundle T M ⊕ T ∗M is endowed with two natural R-bilinear operations: a symmetric bilinear operation 〈·,·〉 and the Courant bracket [[−,−]] given by: 〈X + α, Y + β〉 = 1 2 (ιXβ + ιY α), (1) [[X + α, Y + β]] = [X, Y ] + ( L Xβ − LY α − 1 2 d(ιXβ − ιY α) ) . (2) The vector bundle T M ⊕ T ∗M together with these two operations and the natural projection ρ : T M ⊕ T ∗M → T M form a fundamental example of Courant algebroid (see [1,3]) and ρ is called the anchor map. We will consider complexified bundles, and linearly extend the above symmetric form and the Courant bracket to obtain a complex Courant algebroid structure on (T M ⊕ T ∗M) ⊗ C. Y.S. Poon, A. Wade / C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. I 348 (2010) 919–922 921 Definition 1.1. (See [6].) A generalized F -structure on a smooth manifold M is given by a complex subbundle E of (T M ⊕ T ∗M) ⊗ C of rank k, which is isotropic with respect to the symmetric pairing 〈−,−〉 with E ∩ E⊥ = {0}, where E⊥ is the complex conjugate of the orthogonal complement E⊥ of E relative to 〈−,−〉. If, in addition, the space of sections of E is closed under the Courant bracket, then E is called a generalized CRF-structure. One has: E⊥ ∩ E⊥ = S ⊗ C, where S is a real subbundle of T M ⊕ T ∗M whose rank is 2(dim M − k). Moreover, (T M ⊕ T ∗M) ⊗ C = E ⊕ E ⊕ (S ⊗ C) = Ec ⊕ (S ⊗ C), where Ec = E ⊕ E is the complexification of a real subbundle E ⊂ T M ⊕ T ∗M . CRF-structures generalize both classical F -structures and Cauchy–Riemann structures. The above definition of a generalized F -structure is equivalent to an endomorphism Φ of (T M ⊕ T ∗M) ⊗ C such that Φ + Φ∗ and Φ3 + Φ = 0. The eigenvalues of Φ are i, −i, and 0. Their corresponding eigenbundles are E , E , and S , respectively. Definition 1.2. (See [6].) Let Φ be a generalized F -structure together with global orthogonal cross sections Zr , Z s (r = 1, . . . ,q, s = 1, . . . , p) that span the space Γ (S) of sections of its zero eigenbundle S with 〈Zr, Zr〉 = −1 and 〈Z s, Z s〉 = 1. Then Φ is called a generalized F -structure with complementary frames. We are now interested in generalized F -structures on a (2n + 1)-dimensional manifold M whose corresponding zeroeigenbundle S is spanned by two global sections ξ ± η, for some vector field ξ and for some 1-form η. The pair (Φ, ξ + η) is called a generalized almost contact pair [4]. Two such pairs (Φ, ξ + η) and (Φ ′, ξ ′ + η′) are said to be equivalent if there is a function f without zero on M such that Φ ′ = Φ , η′ = f η, ξ ′ = f ξ . Definition 1.3. (See [4].) A generalized almost contact structure on M is an equivalent class of pairs (Φ, ξ + η). In terms of components, a generalized almost contact structure is given by an equivalent class of tensorial objects: J = (φ,π, θ, ξ,η), where ξ is a vector field, η is a 1-form, π is a bivector field, θ is a 2-form, and φ is a (1,1)-tensor. Indeed, the bundle map Φ : T M ⊕ T ∗M → T M ⊕ T ∗M has four components, i.e. φ : T M → T M , π : T ∗M → T M , θ : T M → T ∗M and −φ∗ : T ∗M → T ∗M , where we adopt the notations: β(π α) = π(α,β), and (θ X)(Y ) = θ(X, Y ) for any 2-form θ , bivector field π , 1-forms α and β , and vector fields X and Y . These tensors are subjected to the following relations: θ φ = φ∗θ , φπ = π φ∗, (3) φ2 + π θ = −I + ξ ⊗ η, (φ∗)",,

Part of these deposits are well lithified (sandstone, conglomerate) while other parts are not (marl, sand and gravel). There is a significant lateral and vertical gradation between the lithified and non-lithified parts. In the eastern sector of Montjuic, these deposits form a 100 m thick sequence made up of 7 coarsening-upward cycles of progradant deltaic origin. Below these cycles there is a massive alluvial unit that extends downward until it reaches a Paleozoic basement made up of metamorphic rocks identified in the subsoil of the Barcelona harbour. In the western sector of Montjuic, the boreholes cut through a 80 m thick sequence made up of 4 fining-upward cycles of retrogradant alluvial origin with minor marine deposits at the top. This sequence is developed over the continental deposits of the Early Miocene (Burdigalian) found in the subsoil of the western edge of Montjuic. The deltaic sequence of the eastern sector corresponds to a higher stratigraphic position than the alluvial sequence of the western sector. Both sectors are bounded by a listric fault of NE-SO strike, which may have caused the sinking of the eastern sector and its tilting toward the NW. This fault would be related to the extensional fault system that formed the coastal Catalan margin during the Neogene period. The entire Miocene unit of Montjuic was also folded and form a gentle anticline of NO-SE strike. This fold would have originated before the faulting and can be interpreted as a syn-edimentary structure originated by a differential compaction between the early cemented alluvial and deltaic sediments that form the fold core and the unconsolidated sediments that form its limbs. Both the anticline and the fault were subsequently unconformably covered by the Quaternary deposits that cover the mountain of Montjuic.",,

5f0e11b89fced0a24b54a8b1,The podhale geothermal system and heating project – an overview,,[{'name': 'Beata  Kepinska'}],"The Podhale region is regarded as a cradle for geothermal energy use for heating purposes in Poland. Since the end of 1980s the research works and activities oriented to geothermal space heating and other uses have been carried out there. There, the first in Poland, Experimental Geothermal Plant was put into operation and successively a great regional heating system has been developed. More than ten years of the project development brought many results of both cognitive and practical meaning for the proper long-term exploitation of the geothermal reservoir and the heating network operation. The paper introduces main geological and reservoir characteristics of the Podhale geothermal system, project’s assumptions, technological, ecological, economical and some other aspects and circumstances. The most recent information concerning the project realization will be presented during the IGD 2004 Field Trip. 1 THE PODHALE REGION – GENERALS The Podhale region is located in southern Poland, within the Inner Carpathians. In the south it borders Slovakia through the Tatras, the only mountains of Alpine character in Central Europe with the highest peaks of Rysy (2499 m a.s.l.) and Gerlach (2655 m a.s.l.).The central part of the region is occupied by the Podhale Basin – the structure, which contains geothermal reservoirs. Podhale is known as a very popular tourist, sport and recreational destination, visited by over four million tourists annually. It belongs to one of the most valuable regions in Europe due to the following features: • Variety of landscape and geological structure; • Unique flora and fauna (four Polish national parks, including the Tatra National Park being joined to the Worldwide Man and Biosphere Reservation System, M&B); • Climatic and tourist value (the centre of winter sport and alpinism, with a number of boarding houses and hotels, a venue of many winter sports competitions); • A vital, rich folk culture and tradition cultivated by local highlanders; • Large resources of geothermal waters characterizing by favourable parameters. On the other hand, Podhale has been affected by intensive anthropopression, especially extensive pollution of natural environment caused by burning large quantities of hard coal for heating (heating season lasts even 8-9 months). Therefore, the project of a regional geothermal heating network having been realised since the end of 1980s is of essential significance to stop further degradation of Podhale ecosystem, and to conduct sustainable management of the environment. 2 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND EVOLUTION In the Podhale region the two main parts of the Carpathian orogen exist the Inner and the Outer Carpathians. They are fragments of the mountain chains that were folded during the alpine orogeny (Cretaceous-Tertiary). Within them, the following geological units have been distinguished (Fig. 1; Fig. 2): • The Inner Carpathians: the Tatra Mountains, the Podhale Basin, and the Pieniny Klippen Belt. They are the constituents of the Podhale geothermal system and each of them plays its own specific role within it; • The Outer Flysch Carpathians: these structures extend North of the Pieniny Klippen Belt and have no direct connection with the Podhale geothermal system. The Tatra Mountains are built of Palaeozoic crystalline core and sedimentary rocks.

Zakopane, September 13-17, 2004 Technical field trip to the Podhale region 224 cover of Palaeozoic core. These units consist mainly of limestones, dolomites, sandstones, marls and clays. They continue to the North, creating the basement of Palaeogene formations that fill the Podhale Basin. They form also the reservoir rocks for geothermal water. The Tatra Mts. act as the main recharge area for the Podhale geothermal aquifers. The Pieniny Klippen Belt is built of Mesozoic and Palaeogene sediments forming complex tectonic units. Regional dislocations separate this structure, usually not exceeding several hundred metres in wideness, from the surrounding units: the Podhale Basin and the Outer Carpathias. The Pieniny Klippen Belt is a relict of the subduction zone of the African and North-European plates being active during the alpine orogenesis. At present, this exremely complex structure is a very long but narrow belt. It stretches almost 800 km from Vienna meters up to 3-5 km in wideness within the area of Poland. The Pieniny Klippen Belt forms the northern impermeable boundary of the Podhale geothermal system. The Podhale Basin is the Polish part of the extensive Inner Carpathian Palaeogene basins located mostly within Slovakian territory (where numerous geothermal systems are found, some of them being exploited for bathing or heating purposes; Fendek and Franko, 2000). Its area within Poland amounts to about 475 km . The Basin was formed in the Palaeogene as an effect of irregular, block uplift of the Tatra Mts. and the Pieniny Klippen Belt. Its basement is composed of Mesozoic formations (that contain geothermal aquifers) outcropping on the surface mostly in the Tatra Mountains. The profile of the Palaeogene formations that fill the basin includes conglomerates and nummulitic limestone (Middle Eocene) of variable thickness (0–350 m), and the Podhale flysch (Upper Eocene–Oligocene) composed of shales, mudstones and intercalations of sandstones (reaching the maximum thickness of 2.5-3 km). The Podhale geothermal aquifers occur within the Podhale Basin. In the South, it borders the Tatra Mts. its main recharge area, while from the North it is limited by the Pieniny Klippen Belt acting as an impermeable barrier. FIGURE 1.

Older formations (Palaeozoic) are expected to underlie the Mesozoic series. The Mesozoic rocks have a typical alpine structure. They form nume-rous nappes and scales overthrusted and folded during the Upper Cretaceous-Palaeocene orogenic period.Tertiary carbonate transgressive series (0350 m in thickness) and a thick flysch formation (2.5-3.2 km) were deposited in situ on the basement of the overthrusted Mesozoic units. At present, they form a structural depression (through). The rocks, which built the Podhale system, underwent long and complex geological evolution.",,

The oil shale is characterized by the clay minerals illite, kaolinite, chlorite, and illite/montmorillonite mixed layer, with their relative contents being 38%-66%, 6%-14%, 1%-6%, and 21%-53%, respectively. Ammonite bed was found at the top of the Shuanghu oil shale section, which was principally of early Toarcian age and roughly within the Harplocearas falciferrum zone. Therefore, the oil shale strata in Shuanghu could be correlated to the early Toarcian black shale distributed extensively in the European epicontinental seas with the records of an oceanic anoxic event. Abundant amounts of calcareous nannofossil (coccolith) with a minor variation of species were first found in the oil shale samples by scanning electron microscope, and named Watznaueria sp. The sedimentary organic matter in laminated shale anomalously rich in organic carbon across the Shuanghu area was characterized by high organic carbon content, with the highest value being 26.1%. The carbon isotope curve displayed that the δ13C values of the kerogen (δ13 Ckerogen) fluctuated from -26.22‰ to -23.53‰ PDB, with a positive excursion close to 2.17‰, which, albeit significantly smaller, might also have been associated with other Early Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs) in Europe. The organic atomic C/N ratios ranged from 6 to 43, and the curve of the C/N ratios was consistent with that of the δ13Ckerogen values. On the basis of organic geochemistry and according to the characteristics of biological assemblage, it was suggested that the carbon-isotope excursion was caused by the changes of sea level and productivity, and that the black shale deposition, especially oil shale deposition, was related to the bloom and high productivity of coccolith.",,

Halimeda reefs are the largest and most complex of the patch reefs and are divisible into core, cap, and flank facies. On the upper and midslope they are up to 40 m thick and 400 m long. They become smaller downslope. The core consists of jumbled Halimeda segments, released by spontaneous disaggregation of the alga. The segments were stabilized close to their sites of growth and rapidly lithified by micritic and peloidal microbial crusts. Residual cavities were further veneered by isopachous marine cements. Flank facies, consisting of bedded packstones to rudstones, form wedge-shaped units lateral to the mounds. Cap facies consist of bioclastic calcarenites/calcirudites and microbial carbonates. Synsedimentary lithification assisted rapid accretion and inhibited off-mound export of sediment. Allochthonous reef-derived blocks on the mid-slope reflect penecontemporaneous rigidity of the Halimeda bioherms.



Proximal Porites coral frame patch reefs associated with calcarenites were located near the shelf margin during the initial lowstand stage. Halimeda segment reefs associated with calcarenites and silty marls developed on the midslope and bivalve-bryozoan-serpulid reefs formed on the lower slope in silty marls with occasional turbidites. During the transgressive stage, coral patch reefs near the shelfbreak were overgrown by Halimeda. During highstand progradation, cap facies spread basinward as a sheet connecting many of the midslope patch reefs.



These ancient analogues differ from most modern Halimeda reefs in being discrete laterally restricted patch reefs, surrounded by marly sediment, and located on a slope. They are, however, broadly comparable in biota, thickness, and depositional depth. Intense early lithification by microbial crusts and marine cements is an important feature of these Messinian segment reefs. It has not been reported from modern examples.",,

The Interglacial sediments of the Medininkai upland are covered by Nemunas (Weichselian) deposits of nonglacial origin. Pollen analysis of the Upper Pleistocene section from the Medininkai locality (borehole 117) shows the Merkine Interglacial and several intervals with different climate oscillations during the Nemunas (Weichselian) glaciation.

They are covered by Early and Middle Nemunas lacustrine and Late Nemunas glacial deposits. This palaeo-lake played a role as the local basis of erosion during the Merkine Interglacial in the Vilnius region. The occurrence and distribution of Merkine Interglacial deposits provide sufficient reliable evidence to establish the position of the maximum extent of the Nemunas ice sheet and to allow investigations of climate history during the Weichselian glaciation.

Each unit of the intertrappeans, consisting of lava ash, clay and marl sandwiched between two basalt flows, was analysed. The concentrations of Fe and Co are found to be generally lower than in the adjacent basalts whereas Cr is similar but occasionally higher in the volcanic ash. Concentrations of eight rare-earth elements (REE), other than Ce, are also similar to their levels in basalts, except at a few horizons in the ash, where higher concentrations by a factor of 2-5 are found. Ir concentration is determined to be <27 pg g-1 in flow basalts and approximately 50 pg g-1 in intertrappeans. However, at two horizons in the ash, concentration about two times greater than the general level (50 pg g-1) in the intertrappeans has been observed. The observed high concentration of REE, Cr and Ir in the intertrappeans could possibly arise as a result of fractionation processes occurring during or after the volcanic episodes if a uniform sedimentation rate is assumed. However, the highest Ir concentration observed in these intertrappeans (0.12 ppb) is lower by a factor of approximately 100 compared to concentrations in KTB clay in the marine section of Meghalaya (12.1 ppb), a few hundred kilometers away. The integrated amount of Ir in the intertrappeans also falls short by factor of approximately 3.5 compared to the Meghalaya section.

Pye'}]","Monitoring of dust deposition at several stations on Crete over a three year period has shown that the present-day depositional flux is of the order of 10-100 g m-2 yr-1. Most of the dust deposition takes place during a few annual dust 'events' which typically last for 1-3 days. Dust haze episodes are usually associated with southerly or southwesterly winds which transport fine sediment from North Africa. Dust is raised by a wide variety of meteorological conditions which generate strong near-surface winds in the source areas, but major long-range transport events are often associated with cold fronts linked to the passage of deep mid-latitude depressions during winter and spring. Dust haze frequency and deposition rates are highest in western Crete and decrease towards the east, suggesting that transport from Tunisia and neighbouring parts of North Africa is particularly important. The measured rate of dust deposition is well below the minimum level required for loess formation. Deposits which have previously been identified as loess are shown to be uncemented marine marls of Tertiary age. Laboratory analysis of red soils, surface sediments, and bedrock samples has confirmed that many of the soils contain an important aeolian dust component, but it is concluded that a more important source of soil parent material is provided by weathering of local rocks. Many of the soils contain significant amounts of quartz sand which cannot have been transported across the sea from North Africa. Reworking of weathered material and deposited dust is extensive, and is accomplished by both aeolian and fluvial processes. Tectonically-controlled depressions in the mountains and parts of the coastal lowlands have acted as long-term sinks in which a thickness of several metres of sediment and soil has accumulated during the Quaternary.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/0B/30/EA/0B30EAFA07E7CD32E1686C1E66ACF992.pdf
5f0c2eaf9fced0a24b91608b,Classification of integrable systems on two-dimensional manifolds and invariants in fomenko ’ s models,,"[{'name': 'JEAN-PAUL  DUFOUR'}, {'name': 'PIERRE  MOLINO'}, {'name': 'ANNE  TOULET'}, {'name': 'Michael  VanValkenburgh'}]","If M is an oriented compact surface, ω a volume form, and F a compact foliation with Morse singularities, we associate to the triple (M, ω,F) some invariants which allow to classify it. Among these invariants, there are Taylor coefficients corresponding to bifurcation points. One can find such invariants in Fomenko’s models for Liouville’s torus bifurcations. If F is the Lagrangian foliation with compact leaves defined on the symplectic manifold (M2n, ω) by a fibration π of M on Q, one knows that Q is provided with an entire affine structure ∇, and J. J. Duistermaat [1] has shown how one can reconstruct (M, ω,F) from an invariant of the quotient object (Q,∇) (the “Chern class of the fibration”). Here we are interested in the case where F is a foliation with singularities of Morse type. In the simplest case (n = 1), we show (cf. I) that the quotient object is provided with natural invariants which allow for the reconstruction of (M, ω,F) (cf. IV). One deduces as in the models of Fomenko in dimension 4 [2] the “branching invariants” for Liouville’s tori [3] (cf. V). To simplify the presentation, we only consider the case where the branching points are simple (vertices of index 3 in the graph). It is not too difficult to extend the definition to the general case. I. Triplets (M, ω,F) and the Associated Reeb Graphs. All the structures considered are of class C∞. I.1. A Preliminary Study. In all that follows, M denotes a compact and connected manifold of dimension 2, and ω is a symplectic (volume!) form on M ; F denotes a Morse foliation in the following sense: it is a foliation with singularities such that for each leaf F of F , there exists a neighborhood U of F , saturated for the foliation, and a proper Morse function fU (to simplify, one supposes that the critical points have pairwise distinct values) such that F restricted to U is defined by the level curves of fU . One calls these level curves “leaves”. Under these hypotheses, all the regular leaves are diffeomorphic to the circle, and a singular leaf is either a pin-point (an elliptic point, or center), or a figure eight (a separatrix, for which the corresponding critical point is a hyperbolic point, or saddle). Two triples (M1, ω1,F1) Communicated by Charles-Michel MARLE. 1 2 J.-P. DUFOUR, P. MOLINO, AND A. TOULET and (M2, ω2,F2) are said to be equivalent if there exists a symplectomorphism from M1 to M2 which preserves the foliation. I.1.1. A Study in a Neighborhood of the Centers. We recall the following well known result [4]: let m0 be a center in (M, ω,F); then there exists a local system of coordinates (x, y) in a neighborhood of m0 such that { ω = dx ∧ dy F : x + y = Const. I.1.2. A Study in a Neighborhood of the Saddles. Let m be a saddle in M and let U be a neighborhood of m such that its saturation is provided by a Morse function f defining the foliation. The saturation of U by the foliation has the appearance of an enlarged figure eight with three connected parts. One calls the leaves “interior leaves” that are situated in one of the parts (1) or (2) inside the figure eight, and “exterior leaves” those situated in the exterior of the figure eight [part (3)]. Shrinking U if necessary, one has the following result (see [4] for part (a)): Lemma 1. (a) There exist local coordinates (x, y) on U such that xy > 0 on the interior leaves (resp. xy < 0 on the exterior leaves), and such that { ω = dx ∧ dy f = λ(xy). (b) Every other system (X, Y ) satisfying (a) is such that XY = xy formally at 0. I.1.3. A Geometric Study. It follows from Lemma 1 that the foliation is defined on U by xy = Const. If F is a leaf of the part (1) [resp. (2), (3)], defined locally by xy = 2, 2 > 0 [resp. 2 < 0 in (3)], the expression of the area between F and the figure eight is given respectively by { Ai(2) = −2 ln(2) + hi(2), i = 1, 2 A3(2) = 22 ln |2|+ h(2) where h, h1, h2 are differentiable functions. In addition, one has the relation: h(0) = −(h 1 (0) + h 2 (0)) for each p. Proposition 1. The Taylor series at 0 of the functions h1 and h2 are invariants of (M, ω,F). I.2. The Reeb Graph Associated to the Couple (M,F). This is the topological quotient space G = M/F [5]. One denotes by p the canonical projection of M onto G. In G, we call a regular point the image by p of a regular leaf, a bout the image of a center, and a bifurcation point the image of a figure eight. The edges are the parts of G contained between two singular points. If s is a bifurcation point, it has three edges; one of them corresponds to the leaves that extend along the separatrix. One says that this edge is the trunk of s; the CLASSIFICATION OF INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS IN DIMENSION 2 3 two other edges are the branches of s. Moreover, the graph is provided with the measure μ, the image by p of the natural measure defined by ω on M . Remark 1. Let m be a saddle in M , and let (x, y) be a local system of coordinates in a neighborhood of m, satisfying Lemma 1. In such coordinates we define in G a function 2 = xy in a neighborhood of the corresponding bifurcation point s, such that xy > 0 on the branches of s and xy < 0 on the trunk of s. The measure μ is expressed in this neighborhood by the formulas (?)    dμi(2) = [ln 2 + gi(2)]d2 on each branch (i = 1, 2) dμ(2) = [2 ln |2|+ g(2)]d2 on the trunk with g, g1, g2 differentiable functions satisfying, for each p, g(0) = (g (p) 1 (0) + g (p) 2 (0)). Remark 2. The expression for the measure μ is deduced from that of the area. One has, as a corollary of Proposition 1, the following result: the Taylor series at 0 of the functions g1 and g2 are invariants of (G, μ). II. Affine Reeb Graphs. Generalizing the notion of Reeb graph seen in 1.2, one is lead to introduce the following definition: Definition 1. Let G be a topological 1-complex where the vertices are of degree 1 or 3. For each vertex s of degree 3, which one calls a bifurcation point, one distinguishes an edge and calls it the trunk of s; the two others are the branches of s. • G is provided with an atlas of the following type: 1) Outside of the bifurcation points, it is a “classical” atlas of a manifold with boundary of dimension 1. 2) In a neighborhood of each bifurcation point s, there exists an open set V and a continuous map φ from V to (−2, 2), 2 > 0, with φ(s) = 0 and such that, if T is the trunk of s and B1, B2 are the branches of s, φ|Bi is bijective on [0, 2), i = 1, 2. φ|T is bijective on (−2, 0]. One requires that the changes of charts are differentiable on each part T ∪Bi, i = 1, 2. • G is provided with a measure given by a non-zero density, C∞ on each edge, and such that for each vertex s of degree 3, there exists a chart φ at s in which the measure μ is written as in (?). One denotes by (G,D, μ) such a graph provided with its differentiable structure and with its measure, and one calls it an affine Reeb graph. 4 J.-P. DUFOUR, P. MOLINO, AND A. TOULET Lemma 2. If the measure μ is written in another chart φ̃ in a neighborhood of s: { dμi(2) = [ln 2 + g̃i(2)]d2 on each branch Bi of s dμ(2) = [2 ln |2|+ g̃(2)]d2 on the trunk of s, then the functions gi and g̃i have the same Taylor series at the origin. (It automatically follows that the Taylor series of g and g̃ at 0 are equal.) The preceding lemma shows that the Taylor series of the functions gi give invariants for the bifurcation points. III. Weighted Reeb Graphs. Definition 2. Let G be a combinatorial graph having vertices of degree 1 or 3. For each vertex s of degree 3, one distinguishes in the same fashion as in Definition 1 the trunk and the branches of s, and one associates to each branch a sequence of real numbers. In addition, to each edge is associated a positive real number called its length. Such a graph is called a weighted Reeb graph. Remark 3. To each affine Reeb graph one naturally associates a weighted Reeb graph, the sequences of numbers associated to the branches corresponding to coefficients of the Taylor series of the functions gi; the “lengths” of the edges are given by their measure. IV. A Classification Theorem. The preceding paragraphs show that one knows how to associate successively to a triplet (M,ω,F) an affine Reeb graph (G,D, μ), unique up to equivalence, and to such an affine Reeb graph a weighted Reeb graph, unique up to equivalence. Conversely, one has the following theorem: Theorem 1. (a) Every weighted Reeb graph is the graph associated to an affine Reeb graph, unique up to equivalence. (b) Every affine Reeb graph is the Reeb graph associated to a triplet (M,ω,F), unique up to equivalence. Thus the triplets (M,ω,F) are classified by the affine Reeb graphs or the weighted Reeb graphs. V. Bifurcation Invariants in Fomenko’s Models. Let (M4, ω, H) be a Hamiltonian system, c a regular value of H, Q a compact connected component of H−1(c), and F a first integral of Bott-Morse on Q. Fomenko has given in this situation a topological description of the singular foliation of Q by Liouville’s tori. We consider a saturated neighborhood U of Liouville’s tori of a separatrix S, containing a single orbit of XH , critical for F |Q = FQ; transversal to this orbit, FQ has a saddle-type singularity. CLASSIFICATION OF INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS IN DIMENSION 2 5 Let T be a connected surface in U which is transversal to XH and which meets all the orbits. (Shrinking U if necessary, one such transversal always exists.) If ωT is the induced volume form on T , FT the singular foliation induced on T by the level surfaces of FQ, σ = S ∩ T is a saddle-type separatrix in FT . Proposition 2. The invariants associated to σ as in Proposition 1 do not depend on the choice of transversal T ; this defines the bifurcation invariants of Liouville’s tori on the separatrix S. This definition naturally extends to more general cases of Fomenko’s models.",,

The ammonite faunas are exclusively present within transgressive systems tracts. Thus, the different types of unconformities cannot be dared with the same precision : transgressive surfaces can be precisely dated by the overlying deposits, and maximum flooding surfaces by the underlying ones. The less precise datations correspond to the sequence boundaries.",,

Particularly in the north of Tarim Basin, the large-scale Rewapu oil field was recently discovered in the Ordovician carbonate rock layer system with buried depth of 7,000 meters, manifesting that a significant potential of exploration exists in Tarim Basin's deep layer and ultra deep layer of Tarim basin. The results indicate that reservoirs of Rewapu oilfield are low porosity and low permeability layers karst reservoirs, reservoir temperature is around at 160 degrees C with oil, and the crude oil comes from the upper Ordovician source rock of the Manjaer depression. The hydrocarbon accumulation time is in the Late Permian, and since the Triassic sedimentation, the reservoir is in the continuous process of burying. It belongs to the old oil and gas system. Due to low geothermal gradient and late quick deep burial, oil reservoir has yet to be cracked, so well-preserved old oil reservoir can be discovered at the depth of 7000m. The Ordovician carbonate reservoir in Rewapu was a fracture-cavity oil reservoir, and the oil and gas distribution and enrichment are controlled not by the local structure, but by the distribution and the development degree of Ordovician carbonate reservoir. The reservoirs of Rewapu block are mainly distributed in the Ordovician Yijianfang formation and at the top Yingshan formation, and the reservoir development degree was controlled by the karstification, the degree of fracture development and the sedimentation facies, concentrating into belts in plane and not controlling by the depth vertically. The overlying strata are limestone of Tumuxiuke formation and marls and limestone of Sangtamu formation in the upper Ordovician. Rewapu oil reservoir features stratified oil and mainly contains normal oil with low viscosity and high wax. Research results show that Ordovician reservoirs in Rewapu block have relatively large depth of burial, but they are still favorable in quality and sit along the path for the oil and gas's northward migration. Therefore, this block has immense resources potential and boasts good exploration and development outlook. In this paper, we study Rewapu block oil reservoir's geological features and hydrocarbon accumulation mechanism, which is of important significance for directing the exploration to oil and gas at the deep layer and ultra deep layer of Tarim Basin.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/37/67/77/376777AD780610794DF31426232033C5.pdf

AFT results (including 19 detrital and 13 bedrock samples) show that deposition in the Tianshui-Huicheng basin range from early Eocene to late Miocene–Pliocene and most of the apatites derived from the Western Qinling orogenic belt, reflecting one rapid exhumation episode (at 34–29 Ma) and two phases of volcanism (at 23–18 Ma and ca. 13 Ma). The exhumation history of the Tianshui-Huicheng region is likely related to episodic tectonic activity and directly linked to the kinematics of active deformation of the Tibetan Plateau. Active processes deciphered from the detritus indicate that deformation reached the northeastern Tibetan Plateau margin as early as ca. 49 Ma, which is manifested by the initiation of the Tianshui-Huicheng basin. The 23–18 Ma event, linked to the lithosphere deformation of the Western Qinling and the Neogene basin formation along the Tianshui-Huicheng region. By modeling the bedrock samples, an 8–4 Ma event was revealed which resulted from the intense deformation of the Tianshui-Huicheng region. Keywords Cenozoic Tianshui-Huicheng region Tibetan Plateau Fission track 1 Introduction The 4–5 km high Tibetan plateau is an outstanding topographic feature on Earth today. Its construction is regarded as a response to the convergence of India with Asia during the Cenozoic ( Argand, 1924; Besse and Courtillot, 1988; Le Pichon et al., 1992; Molnar and Tapponnier, 1975; Yin and Harrison, 2000 ). Its evolution is therefore essential to understand the lithospheric behavior during continental collision, the mechanisms of plateau uplift and their influence on global climate changes ( DeCelles et al., 2002; Mattauer et al., 1999; Royden, 1996; Ruddiman et al., 1989; Burbank et al., 1993; Molnar et al., 1993 ). The northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau (defined as the region bounded by the Western Qinling and Kunlun faults to the south, Altyn Tagh faults and Qilian Mountain to the northwest and north, and Haiyuan fault and Liupan Mountain to the northeast and east; Fig. 1 a), is a region where the plateau is actively deforming due to coeval crustal shortening and left-lateral strike-slip faulting ( Burchfiel et al., 1991; Zhang et al., 1991; Meyer et al., 1998; Tapponnier et al., 2001 ). Initial deformation in this region at Eocene–Oligocene time has been inferred from thermochronological analysis, mainly apatite fission-track (AFT) dating, along the Altyn Tagh faults and Kunlun faults surrounding the Qaidam Basin ( George et al., 2001; Jolivet et al., 2001; Sobel et al., 2001; Clark et al., 2010; Mock et al., 1999 ). However, the exhumation history of this region is still poorly known. Enkelmann et al. (2006) suggested that rapid cooling in the western Qinling initiated at 9–4 Ma. A similar time range has been proposed by Zheng et al. (2006) who argued that the rapid exhumation on the Liupan mountain occurred at 7.3–8.2 Ma, as the response to the northeastward growth of the Tibetan Plateau. However, these studies, based on bedrock low-temperature thermochronological methods, whether they be 40 Ar/ 39 Ar on mica/feldspar or zircon/apatite fission track and (U–Th)/He, typically yield ages only documenting the younger events. Contrarily, detrital thermochronology can provide a long-term record of an evolving orogenic system through the analysis of samples from sediments of different depositional ages derived from an eroding mountain belt, and the combination of the detrital and bedrock AFT thermochronology can be used for provenance analysis, dating sediments, stratigraphic correlation, and reconstruction of the cooling and exhumation history of the source terrane (e.g., Brandon and Vance, 1992; Bernet et al., 2006; Garver and Brandon, 1994a,b; Garver et al., 1999; Van der Beek et al., 2006; Zattin et al., 2003 ). The AFT system is sensitive to shallow crustal level processes because of the low effective closure temperature (∼110 ± 10 °C), so that, in principle, can be used to trace short-lived variations in the exhumation rate ( Van der Beek et al., 2006 ). However, the relatively low closure temperature of the AFT thermochronometer makes this system also sensitive to postdepositional heating within the sedimentary basin. As a sample is buried deeper in the sedimentary basin and reaches temperatures corresponding to the AFT partial annealing zone (PAZ; ∼60–120 °C), the information it contains concerning source-area exhumation is progressively lost. Fortunately, Cenozoic basin successions of the northeastern corner of Tibetan Plateau are relatively condensed in thickness (e.g., Xining basin: magnetostratigraphic depositional ages range from 52 to 17 Ma with a sedimentary thickness of 820 m, Dai et al., 2006 ; Linxia basin: stratigraphic ages range from 29 to 1.7 Ma with thickness of ∼1200 m, Fang et al., 2003 ) and, given that the thermal gradient is 20–40 °C/km ( Lei et al., 1999 and references therein), it is very likely that the basin strata preserve a long record without the complication of thermal annealing of the apatites. In this paper, we present detrital AFT data from 19 samples collected from sedimentary successions spanning from Eocene to Pliocene age along the Tianshui and Huicheng basins as well as 13 bedrock samples from the Western Qinling mountain chain, with the aim to shed more light on the timing of cooling and exhumation events and to improve the understanding of the long-term evolution of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau margin. Apart from comparing detrital ages with bedrock ages to constrain the candidate source areas of the studied basins, the types of source terrane and the young peak ages are analyzed to reveal the roles of tectonics and erosion on the long-term exhumation history. In addition, the bedrock samples can give some information about possible presence of tectonic events in the study region. As an ultimate outcome, we attempt to unravel the paleogeography of the northeastern Tibetan plateau margin from the Eocene to the Pliocene. 2 Geologic setting The Tianshui-Huicheng region is situated in the northeastern corner of the Tibetan Plateau. It is composed of the Tianshui, Lixian-Xihe and Huicheng basins, and of part of the Western Qinling orogenic belt ( Fig. 1 b). It is a conjunction region among the North China Craton, the South China Craton and the Tibetan Plateau ( Fig. 1 a). Rock units exposed in the Tianshui-Huicheng region range from Proterozoic to recent in age, but Paleozoic–Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks form the most extensive outcrops ( GBS, 1967, 1968 ). Devonian strata and Upper Permian–Triassic granitoids (a.k.a. Indosinian granitoids) are the most widely exposed pre-Cenozoic rock units in this region, and form the main body of the Western Qinling ( Fig. 1 b). Cenozoic rocks also crop out widely in the study area. Several Neogene kamafugite and carbonatite volcanic pipes are exposed close to Lixian ( Yu, 1994; Yu et al., 2006 ) and Cenozoic volcanic rocks have been reported in the Shetang region ( Pei et al., 2004 ) ( Fig. 1 b). Cenozoic sedimentary deposits are widespread in the study area and unconformably overlie the pre-Cenozoic rocks. These strata consist of red, brown or gray mudstone, marl, siltstone, sandstone and conglomerate that range from probably Paleogene to Neogene with a thickness ranging from ∼200 m to ∼1800 m ( Li et al., 2006; Zhai and Cai, 1984 ). Three prominent Cenozoic unconformities occur in the Tianshui-Huicheng region ( Zhai and Cai, 1984 ). The lowermost one lies between older basement rocks and Paleogene conglomerate and sandstone deposits. A younger angular unconformity lies between the Paleogene strata and Neogene coarse sandstone. The upper hiatus is also an angular unconformity between the late Miocene/early Pliocene mudstone and late Pliocene sediments or Quaternary Loess ( Zhang, 2008 ), suggesting the existence of an extensive Pliocene deformation event. The Cenozoic deformation of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau margin was controlled by two large sinistral strike-slip boundaries, the Altyn Tagh Faults and the Kunlun Faults ( Yin and Harrison, 2000; Yin et al., 2002; Mock et al., 1999 ), and possibly resulted from northeastward propagation of deformation of the India–Asia collision and Tibetan Plateau uplift ( Meyer et al., 1998; Tapponnier et al., 2001 ). The propagation of deformation along these two boundaries also resulted in the formation of a series of parallel ranges typically separated by basins ( Métivier et al., 1998; Meyer et al., 1998; Tapponnier et al., 1990 ). The sediments of these basins and their vicinity bedrocks record the details of the history of deformation and uplift of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau margin (e.g., Fang et al., 2003; Yin et al., 2002; Clark et al., 2010; Enkelmann et al., 2006 ). 2.1 The Tianshui basin and its stratigraphy The Tianshui basin is a sub-basin of the large Longzhong Basin ( Zhai and Cai, 1984 ), and represents the junction point of the Liupan mountain and the Western Qinling orogenic belt. The Cenozoic successions of the Tianshui basin are discordant on the older bedrocks and are divided into the “Guyuan Group” (Paleogene) and “Gansu Group” (Neogene) on the basis of lithofacies and paleontology ( Zhai and Cai, 1984 ). The Guyuan Group consists of interbedded conglomerate and sandstone (e.g., Ganquan section; Fig. 2 a), or poorly sorted breccia (e.g., Yaodian section; Fig. 2 b and c) with thicknesses varying between several tens to hundreds of meters. It contains the conchostracod Yunmenglimnadia gansuensis , Neolimuadia sp. , and the ostracods Cyprois sp., Cyprinotus sp., Candoniella sp., Eucypris sp., Metacypris sp. ( GBS, 1968; Zhai and Cai, 1984 ), constraining the depositional age to Eocene and Oligocene. The Gansu Group is discordant to the Guyuan Group ( Fig. 2 b). In addition to the abundant mammal fossils and the detailed magnetostratigraphic chronology ( Li et al., 2006; Zhang, 2008 ), the Gansu Group has been subdivided into four formations: (1) the Ganquan formation (Aquitanian to Serravallian), (2) Yaodian formation (Tortonian), composed of interbedded gray-green marlite and reddish brown mudstone, known as “Zebra Beds” due to its rhythmic alternation in color ( Fig. 2 d; Li et al., 2006 ), (3) the Yangjizhai formation (Messinian to Zanclean), capped by Quaternary loess or unconformably covered by (4) the Lamashan formation (Piacenzian). In order to increase the correlation among the Cenozoic strata of the Tianshui and the other study basins, three stratigraphic sections were measured (locations and details are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 b). The Xiashan and Yaodian sections can be well correlated to each other by the abundant mammal fossils and high-resolution paleomagnetic data ( Li et al., 2006; Zhang, 2008 ). Only mammal fossil age and lithological correlation are possible for the Ganquan section. The correlation of units of the different sections is illustrated in Fig. 3 . 2.2 The Xihe-Lixian and Huicheng basins The Xihe-Lixian and Huicheng basins are intermontane basins located in the Western Qinling orogenic belt ( Fig. 1 b). The Xihe-Lixian basin is separated from the Tianshui basin by the Fenghuang mountain belt although the two basins were joined until the late Cenozoic. The exposed Cenozoic succession is similar in both basins and a stratigraphic section was measured in Lamashan (the location is shown in Fig. 1 b and Table 1 ). Based on the magnetostratigraphy and the lithology ( Zhang, 2008 ), the Lamashan section is easily correlated with the sections of the Tianshui basin. Therefore, in the following discussion, the so called Tianshui basin also includes the Xihe-Lixian basin. The Huicheng basin is separated from the Xihe-Lixian basin by the Jinling-Songjia mountain belt ( Fig. 1 b). Its Cenozoic successions overlie older bedrocks with an unconformity. On the basis of lithologic distinctions and fossil content, the Cenozoic stratigraphy of the Huicheng basin is divided into two groups: the Paleogene Guyuan Group and the Neogene Gansu Group ( Zhai and Cai, 1984 ). The contact between the Guyuan and the Gansu Groups is angular unconformable. The Guyuan Group is characterized in its lower part by conglomerate interbedded with sandstone, whereas in its upper part by silty mudstone interbedded with conglomerate. The Gansu Group has a rich record of Neogene mammal fossils ( Zhai and Cai, 1984; Zhang and Xue, 1994 ). In general, it consists of a lower portion characterized by sandy conglomerate interbedded with siltstone and an upper portion made of siltstone or mudstone interbedded with sandy conglomerate. In this study, four Cenozoic outcrops of the Huicheng basin were sampled. One of them (Guandian section) concerns the Guyuan group and the others (Yingning section, Hongchuan section and Zhifang section) are sampled from Gansu Group (locations and details are shown in Table 1 and Figs. 1b and 3 ). 3 Sample preparation and methodology In this study, we collected detrital samples of about 6–10 kg and bedrock samples of about 4 kg. Samples were crushed, washed, sieved and apatite crystals were separated using heavy liquids (Tetrabromoethane and Diiodomethane) and standard magnetic separation techniques. Mounts of apatite in epoxy resin were ground and polished to expose internal grain surfaces and then etched with 5 N HNO 3 at 20 °C for 20 s to reveal spontaneous fission tracks. Samples and CN-5 dosimeter were irradiated with thermal neutrons in the well-thermalized reactor of Oregon State University with a nominal neutron fluence of 9 × 10 15 n cm −2 . After irradiation, induced fission tracks in the U-poor muscovite that covered apatite grain mounts and glass dosimeters were revealed by etching in 40% HF at 20 °C for 45 min. Fission tracks were counted on a Zeiss microscope, using a 1250× magnification under dry objectives. Fission-track ages were calculated using the external detector and zeta-calibration methods ( Hurford and Green, 1983 ) with Fish Canyon and Durango age standards ( Hurford, 1990 ). Based on nine analyses, the ξ value for Xiuxi Wang is 340.03 ± 3.22. The grain age distributions were subjected to the χ 2 test ( Galbraith, 1981 ) to detect whether they contained any extra-Poissonian error. A χ 2 probability ⩾5% is indicative of a homogeneous population. For the bedrock samples, track lengths were measured by digitizing the track ends using a drawing tube, and the diameter of etch pit (defined as Dpar) was measured in the dated crystals, to constrain their annealing kinetics (e.g., Barbarand et al., 2003; Carlson et al., 1999 ). The program HeFTy ( Ketcham, 2005 ) was used to find a range of cooling paths compatible with the measured bedrock data. HeFTy allows a variety of annealing models to be utilized. We used the annealing model of Ketcham et al. (2007) , which allows the user to vary kinetic parameters such as Dpar in each model run. In each of the model simulations, the sample-specific kinetic data (Dpar) were used. Ten thousand t–T paths were randomly generated using a Monte Carlo algorithm. 4 Results 4.1 Detrital samples Of the nineteen analysed samples, fourteen are from the Tianshui basin and five from the Huicheng basin. Sample positions in the stratigraphic sections are shown in Fig. 3 . For each sample, whenever possible, at least 75 apatite grains were dated and all suitable grains were counted in samples that contained less than 75 grains. All the samples failed the χ 2 test, showing a broad dispersion of single grain ages. Because in most of the cases grain ages are older than the stratigraphic ages, we can suppose that post-depositional annealing was very low and/or the perturbation of isotherms near the surface was minor. In addition, as illustrated in Fig. 3 , the condensed sections of the study basins are most likely to preserve unreset detrital grains and, therefore, the grain ages can be referred to exhumation of source rocks ( Brandon and Vance, 1992 ). Binomial peak-fitting method ( Brandon, 1996 ) was used to decompose the observed fission track grain age distributions into their main grain-age components or peaks. Representative grain-age distribution and generated probability density plots are shown in Fig. 4 . Correlation of age components among the different samples resulted into six peak-age groups, as shown in Table 2 , listed as P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 and P6. All of them are fairly consistent and do not change significantly up-section. Thus, they can be considered as static peaks ( Bernet et al., 2006; Brandon and Vance, 1992; Garver and Brandon, 1994a,b ). 4.2 Bedrock samples Thirteen samples were analyzed using the AFT method. Whenever possible, at least 30 grains were dated and all suitable grains were counted in samples that contained less than 30 grains. Results of AFT analysis are listed in Table 3 . Central ages range from 100.9 ± 6.4 Ma (FT8) to 21.4 ± 2.2 Ma (FT26) and mean confined track lengths range from 10.72 ± 0.39 μm (FT26) to 14.37 ± 0.19 μm (FT6). Among all the bedrock data, only sample FT32 failed the χ 2 test and the grain dispersion could be due to heterogeneous annealing. The annealing properties of fission tracks in apatite have been tested by the measurements of Dpar ( Burtner et al., 1994; Carlson et al., 1999 ). Four Dpars were measured in each of the dated grains. 5 Discussion 5.1 Interpretation of the bedrock samples and a possible record of rapid, late-stage exhumation event As illustrated in Fig. 5 a, there are generally no simple relationships between elevation and bedrock AFT ages. This pattern indicates multiple denudation events or regionally complex cooling/tectonic history throughout the study area as confirmed also by the dispersion of the points in the bedrock AFT age against mean track length plot ( Green, 1986 ; Fig. 5 b). Other factors however, may also perturb these relationships. The annealing properties of fission tracks in apatite vary with chemical composition ( Barbarand et al., 2003; Gleadow and Duddy, 1981; Green et al., 1985 ) and mineralogical properties (including variability in etching response, structural strain, the extent of аlfa-damage in the crystal; Carlson et al., 1999 ). However, results of Dpar measurements show that there is no correlation between Dpar and AFT age ( Fig. 6 ), indicating that the effect of these factors is less important than the different inherited thermal histories. Modeling of fission-track data needs some external constraints that are inserted in the HeFTy program. In the study area, very reliable information comes from biotite 40 Ar/ 39 Ar data from indosinian granitoids that suggested an intrusion age of 230–210 Ma ( Zheng et al., 2004 ). Therefore we use this time range as a main constraint, assuming a closure temperature for biotite of ∼350 °C. The oldest AFT age is from sample FT8 (100.9 ± 6.4 Ma), located about 65 km northeastern the other samples from indosinian granitoids. FT8 has a broader, negatively skewed (=−0.326) unimodal length distribution with a mean track length of 12.51 ± 0.15 μm ( N = 106), pointing to a long residence within the upper (lower-temperature) part of the PAZ (∼60–90 °C). Data from the indosinian granitoids samples FT27–29, as shown in Fig. 5 a and Table 3 , show nearly identical AFT age (38.8 ± 1.6–43.1 ± 1.9 Ma) and similar cooling history ( Fig. 7 ). Sample FT26 (21.4 ± 2.2 Ma), collected about 3 km distance from FT27, yields the shortest mean track length (10.72 ± 0.39 μm, N = 37) and the length distribution is broad and unimodal, indicating again a long residence time within the PAZ ( Fig. 7 ). The track length distributions of the Middle-Devonian metamorphic rocks (mean track lengths range from 12.19 μm to 13.55 μm, Table 3 ) are unimodal with negative skewness. Because the thermal history of these rocks is poorly known and no other age-temperature data can be used for modeling constraint, this study only focuses on the time after the apparent AFT ages with the assumption that the effective track accumulation started a bit earlier than the measured AFT ages and samples were cooling from temperatures more than 120 °C at that time. Their temperature–time paths are shown in Fig. 7 . Completely different is the thermal history of sample FT6, from Cenozoic volcanic rocks, which gives a fission-track age of 28.5 ± 2.3 Ma. It yields a narrow unimodal length distribution with the longest mean track length (14.37 ± 0.19 μm), indicating that the sample had not experience strong thermal disturbance after the volcanic cooling ( Fig. 7 ). Hence, the measured AFT age can be related to the formation age of the volcanics. As illustrated in Fig. 7 , some samples show an increase of the cooling rates starting in the late Miocene–Pliocene (8–4 Ma) and consistent with the previous study of Enkelmann et al. (2006) . 5.2 Types of AFT source terrane and the possible depositional ages As summarized by Bernet et al. (2006) , three types of source terranes represented by a static peak can be recognized in the detrital distribution of fission-track ages: (1) a source terrane that experienced a rapid but short-lived cooling event; (2) a volcanic source terrane, with a thick section and not reset rocks; (3) a sedimentary source area (also called cover units by Garver et al., 1999 ) that provides the recycled detrital minerals, in particular if the peak age is relatively old and predates orogenesis. In this study, the young populations of grain ages are received the most attention, because they can be commonly ascribed to active processes in the source terrain. The youngest component of unreset volcanic grains is proved to be a good constrain on the depositional age of the basin sediments ( Garver and Brandon, 1994a ). Brandon and Vance (1992), Garver and Brandon, (1994a,b) and Garver et al. (1999) suggested that in areas with active tectonics, the unreset apatite/zircon static peak represents the time of tectonic activity, and the youngest population age of each sample represents the maximum age for the deposition of the sediment. Accordingly, although there are no indications about nature of apatite grains, minimum age of FT12 demonstrates that the Neogene sediments of Ganquan section are younger than Aquitanian (ca. 20.4 ± 3.1 Ma). Minimum ages of FT9 and FT10 demonstrate that the deposition of the Tianshui basin and the middle Guyuan Group initiated at about early Eocene (ca. 49.2 ± 10.2 Ma) and early Oligocene (ca. 33.9 ± 6.2 Ma). Youngest peak of sample YD1390’ similarly demonstrates the initiation deposition of Yaodian section at about middle Eocene (ca. 40.6 ± 6.8 Ma). Minimum age of sample YD1420 demonstrates that the deposition of middle Guyuan Group of Yaodian section initiated at about early Oligocene (ca. 29.7 ± 4.0 Ma). Further work on other stratigraphical chronology is urged for testing this preliminary inference. 5.3 Implications for provenance and relationship between Tianshui and Huicheng basins The AFT peak ages of the Huicheng basin samples can be compared very well with data from the Tianshui basin ( Table 2 ). For example, comparison of peak ages between hch2–3 of the Yingning section from Huicheng basin and FT12–15 of the Ganquan section from the Tianshui basin indicates that the sediments exposed along the Yingning section could belong to the Ganquan formation that is exposed in the Tianshui basin ( Fig. 3 ). The consistent correlation among the peak ages of the two basins suggests that their unreset AFT peak ages record the same orogenesis cooling/exhumation history of the source terranes, confirming the evidence given by palaeocurrent directions ( Fig. 3 ). Hence, we speculate that the different basins of the Tianshui-Huicheng region were originally connected to each other through the Jinling-Songjia mountain belt. Peak ages of all samples can be used to find potential sources in the Western Qinling by comparing them to present bedrock AFT ages. Apatites in a fission-track grain age peak can only have been derived from area where the present bedrock AFT ages are younger or equal to the age of the peak. The present bedrock AFT data set in this area does not reveal any ages young enough to produce the detrital ages of the P1 and P2 age components ( Fig. 8 ), suggesting that the long-term exhumation was too slow. The P1 and P2 apatites should be therefore attributed to volcanic source terranes. Furthermore, almost all the observed euhedral and translucent grains belong to these components among the analyzed ones, which conforms our inference. Local volcanic suites are known in the Lixian region, where intrusion is dated at 7–23 Ma ( Yu, 1994; Yu et al., 2006 ). Some igneous intrusions in the north and south central Tibet are reported in the same age window ( Deng, 1998; Ding et al., 2003; China Geological Survey, 2004; Wang et al., 2004 ). The third component (P3) yields ages between 29.0 ± 5.3 and 33.9 ± 6.2 Ma. The potential source areas are the Lamashan Dike, Mayanhe range (sandy slate and part of Indosinian granitoids) and the Shetang volcanic rocks ( Fig. 8 ). However, most grains of this component are generally rounded and not as translucent as volcanically derived crystals, but are instead more typical of grains derived from crystalline basement rocks. This suggests that this age population represents an exhumation signal rather than an Oligocene volcanic input (i.e. from ashes). Although a limited amount of ash contamination may be potentially present, this would not significantly alter the main population age. Note that some types of volcanic activity have the significance of lithosphere deformation and Tibet uplift (e.g., Chung et al., 1998 ), further work is necessary to study the features, mineral compositions and the geodynamic significance of Shetang volcano. The fourth component, P4, yields ages between 38.6 ± 7.6 and 49.2 ± 10.2 Ma, and similar ages have been found mainly in the other part of Mayanhe Indosinian granitoids and the Jiaoping metamorphites ( Fig. 8 ). Again, the observed color and shape of its grains indicate that they are derived from crystalline basement rocks rather than unconsolidated volcanic sources. Thus, P4 component represents an exhumation event of the source terrane. There is no Paleocene–Eocene volcanic intrusion within and along the study region, which corroborates our interpretation. The Indosinian granitoids in the Gangu-Lixian area, the Devonian metamorphites in the Lamashan region and the Paleozoic metamorphites in the south rim of the basin have been dated from 50 to 80 Ma ( Zheng, 2001; Enkelmann et al., 2006 ; Fig. 8 ). These ages provide an exact match with the P5 component, suggesting that location of sources can be identified in these areas. The oldest peak P6 ranges between 102.5 ± 19.6 and 167.6 ± 50.2 Ma. Most of these AFT grain age peaks represent a minor fraction of the dated crystals (0.3–14%) and have quite large errors. However, Zheng (2001) dated the pre-Cenozoic bedrocks along the west region of Lixian and the ages are in the range of 100–112 Ma ( Fig. 8 ). Furthermore, Enkelmann et al. (2006) dated the Paleozoic metamorphites located in the Xiangquan-Liqiao region at 80–100 Ma ( Fig. 8 ). Note that only the oldest grain of hch8 is typically euhedral and translucent among these components, grains. 5.4 Paleogeographic evolution Our data allow detecting most of the potential sources of the Tianshui-Huicheng sediments that seem to derive mainly from the Western Qinling. The oldest deposits have been dated to be early Eocene (ca. 49.2 ± 10.2 Ma) in the Tianshui-Huicheng basin, indicating the occurrence a rapid exhumation event triggered by tectonism occurred in the northeastern margin of Tibetan Plateau. Erosion of Western Qinling provided the sediments for the subsiding Tianshui-Huicheng basin which were deposited in an alluvial environment ( Fig. 9 a). The onset of deposition in the Tianshui-Huicheng basin correlates well with the documented history of other Tibetan basins: (i) onset of the nearby Lanzhou and Xining sub-basins of the Longzhong basin at about 58 Ma and 55 Ma, respectively ( Yue et al., 2001; Dai et al., 2006 ); (ii) onset of the Shanglaxiu basin at 51–49 Ma in the Nanqian-Yushu region of east central Tibet ( Horton et al., 2003; Spurlin et al., 2005 ); (iii) onset of the Hoh Xil basin at 56–51 Ma in north central Tibet along the Jinsha suture zone ( Liu et al., 2003 ); (iv) onset of subsidence in the Qaidam basin documented at 46–49 Ma ( Yin et al., 2002 ). In this time range it is well documented a tectonic activity for the Kunlun faults and Altyn Tagh faults, implying that very early in the India–Asia collision, deformation occurred far to the northeast along major mechanical boundaries ( Clark et al., 2010; Jolivet et al., 2001 ). This deformation event is interpreted as the driving mechanism for the creation of these Paleocene-early Eocene basins located in the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau ( Horton et al., 2003; Yin et al., 2002; Spurlin et al., 2005 ). The P3 component mostly represents an exhumation signal at about 34–29 Ma. This phase cooling event probably not affected the Tianshui-Huicheng basin, as it is not manifested by any unconformity through the stratigraphic section or drastic change in depositional environment, as would be expected if related to the activation of nearby bounding structures. Thus, we argue that the detected signal is related to a more distal source and connected to the deformation of the Tibetan Plateau. This deformation event is known from the eastern and northeastern Tibetan Plateau and is demonstrated by: (i) depositional environment transition with increase in sedimentary rates reported in the same age window in the Lanzhou and Xining basins ( Yue et al., 2001; Dai et al., 2006 ); (ii) the onset of subsidence and sedimentation in the Linxia basin before 29 Ma ( Fang et al., 2003 ); (iii) a phase of tectonic event occurred at ca. 33.4 Ma along the Hexi corridor ( Dai et al., 2005 ); (iv) cooling at ca. 30 Ma in the East Kunlun mountain ( Mock et al., 1999 ). During 23–18 Ma, volcanic intrusion occurred in the Lixian area and provided younger apatite grains to the Tianshui-Huicheng basin. The magma originated directly from the mantle during the lithosphere deformation of the Western Qinling due to asthenospheric upwelling ( Su et al., 2009 ). The Tibetan Plateau actively deformed and intense surface uplift occurred in the central ( Chemenda et al., 2000; Hodges et al., 1996 ; Parrish and Hodges, 1993 ; Yin et al., 1994 ) and the northern margin ( Clark et al., 2004; George et al., 2001 ), with volcanic activity in the western region ( Ding et al., 2003 ) and the northern/northeastern region (Deng., 1998; Yu et al., 2006 ). The angular unconformity between the Neogene and Paleogene succession of the Tianshui-Huicheng basin clearly reflects this tectonic control on the subsidence and sedimentation. As a consequence of the tectonic load, the Western Qinling rock uplifted again and the Paleogene strata in the study area were deformed; later, the Tianshui-Huicheng region was affected by broad flexural subsidence and conglomerate/sandstone of the Ganquan formation were deposited ( Fig. 9 b). At ca. 13 Ma, the study region was affected by renewed volcanic activity ( Yu, 1994 ), providing new detrital apatites to the basin, as detected from detrital AFT data obtained from the Yaodian Formation. This signal is consistent with geological data from different areas, including the chronological analysis of K-rich volcanic rocks suggesting uplift of Tibet at 13 Ma ago ( Turner et al., 1993 ) and the hydrothermal muscovite data suggesting east–west extension of the Tibetan Plateau at 14 Ma ago ( Coleman and Hodges, 1995 ). The accommodation space was progressively reduced and finally, depositional environments changed drastically between the deposition of the Yaodian and Ganquan Formations at about 11.7 Ma ( Figs. 2d and 3 ). In fact, the Yaodian Formation contain a rich fossil mammal fauna, alga and ostracods, and pollens assemblage dominated by conifer-broadleaf mixed forest ( Li et al., 2006 ), which indicate a humid forested environment until the late Miocene. The rapid, late-stage exhumation, detected by forward modeling of the Western Qinling bedrock AFT data, occurred at late Miocene–Pliocene (8–4 Ma), and was related to the growth of the Tibetan Plateau ( Enkelmann et al., 2006 ). The basin sediments appear to be folded by tectonic uplift ( GBS, 1968; Zhang, 2008 ), with formation of orographic barriers, such as Fenghuang and Jinling-Songjia mountain belts. The basin was separated into Tianshui, Xihe-Lixian and Huicheng sub-basins and the drainage system was reorganized, the nascent structure of the modern geomorphic frame along the northeastern Tibet formed at last ( Fig. 9 c). 6 Conclusions Bedrock and detrital AFT analysis in the Tianshui-Huicheng basin provides valuable information on the early Eocene to late Miocene–Pliocene exhumation history of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau margin. By analysis of the youngest peak ages, the possible depositional ages are revised as that the early Eocene (ca. 49.2 ± 10.2 Ma) for the oldest paleogene deposits and the early Miocene (ca. 20.4 ± 3.1 Ma) for the oldest Neogene deposites of the Tianshui-Huicheng basin, respectively. The provenance analysis based on detrital thermochronology and the palaeocurrent directions reveals that the detritus was mainly coming from Western Qinling and the basin system along the study region was connected during the depositional period but finally separated at late Miocene–Pliocene (8–4 Ma). Exhumation history of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau margin was episodic rather than continuous and the system evolution of coupling mountain and basin along this region was mainly controlled by tectonism. The basin sediments preserve the thermochronological evidences for four phases of active processes: (A) ca. 49 Ma event, as response to the Tibetan deformation due to the India–Asia collision, resulting from the exhumation of Western Qinling and the onset of the Tianshui-Huicheng basin; (B) 34–29 Ma event, which not affected the Tianshui-Huicheng basin but would have to be a comparatively distal response to the Tibetan deformation; (C) 23–18 Ma event, in connection with the lithosphere deformation of Western Qinling and the formation of Neogene Tianshui-Huicheng basin; (D) ca. 13 Ma event. By modeling the bedrock data from Western Qinling, a rapid, late-stage exhumation has been constrained at 8–4 Ma and associated with formation of the nascent geomorphic frame of the modern northeastern margin of Tibetan Plateau.

The order of inhibition for the enzymes by the Cree plant extracts was: 2C19 > 3A7 > 3A5 > 3A4 > 2C9 > 2C8 > FMO3 > 1A2 > 2E1 > 19 > 2D6 > 2B6. Extracts from Rhododendron groenlandicum , Sorbus decora , and Kalmia angustifolia were identified as having strong inhibition towards many CYP isoforms. Conclusion These findings demonstrate that extracts from most plant species examined have the potential to affect CYP2C- and 3A4-mediated metabolism, and have the potential to affect the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of conventional and traditional medicines during concomitant use.

The use of traditional medicinal plants is widely practiced by North American aboriginals with more than 2500 native plants identified for their medicinal value ( Moerman, 2007 ). The Cree Nation of Eeyou Istchee (CEI), located in northern Quebec is a group of First Nations who commonly practice traditional medicine to treat health problems related to T2D. This disease is suffered by more than 18% of the population which is approximately four times the provincial prevalence ( Kuzmina and Lejeune, 2006 ). Recently, 17 traditional plant species were examined pharmacologically for their potential anti-diabetic activity and several species were identified that have the potential to treat T2D symptoms ( Spoor et al., 2006; Harbilas et al., 2009 ). However, to our knowledge no studies have been conducted on their safety with respect to drug metabolism. This information is critical for the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay who propose to integrate traditional NHPs as a complement to conventional anti-diabetic therapeutic products. CYPs are involved in metabolizing 90% of all marketed therapeutic products ( Lewis, 2004 ), as well as other xenobiotics and endogenous substances ( Guengerich, 2003 ). In the human genome, 57 genes coding for CYP isoforms have been identified, with 16 of them coding for isoforms involved in drug metabolism: CYP19, 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2A13, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 2F1, 2J2, 3A4, and 3A5 ( Guengerich, 2008 ). Other isoforms may also be involved. Substrate specificity differs among the CYP isoforms, allowing a broad range of therapeutic products differing in molecular weight, shape, planarity, and charge to be metabolized ( Lewis, 2003 ). Obtaining a pharmacologically effective plasma concentration of therapeutic products is dependent on many factors including CYP activity. Changes in CYP catalytic activity through induction or inhibition by xenobiotics can alter pharmaceutical drug plasma concentrations to ineffective or toxic levels, both which can have adverse effects. CYP inhibition is one of the most common causes of clinical interactions between pharmaceutical drugs and other xenobiotics such as NHPs ( Bailey et al., 1991; Zhou et al., 2003; Flanagan, 2005 ). Interactions between drugs used by the T2D patient population and NHPs have been documented. Several antibiotics which are inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, clarithromycin and telithromycin, have changed the bioavailability of the meglitanide repaglinide during concomitant use ( Scheen, 2007a ). Similar interactions have also been observed with thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) and CYP2C8 inhibitors such as rifampicin, gemfibrozil, and trimethoprim ( Scheen, 2007b ). St. John's wort has been shown to increase the clearance of gliclazide due to its induction of CYP2C9 expression ( Xu et al., 2008 ). Although the majority of pharmaceuticals are metabolized by CYPs, there are other enzymes that contribute to Phase I drug metabolism, including FMOs. The most important member of this family is FMO3 which is the prominent FMO in adult human liver ( Cashman, 2000 ). FMO3 is involved in the monooxygenation of drugs such as cimetidine, ketoconazole, ranitidine, clozapine and tamoxifen ( Cashman, 2000; Zhou and Shephard, 2006 ). The aim of this study was to determine whether the Cree NHPs identified in previous studies having anti-diabetes properties can affect metabolism, and thus the bioavailability of anti-diabetic drugs and thereby induce adverse events. Extracts of the 17 anti-diabetic plant species were screened for inhibition of 11 CYP isoforms and FMO3 to predict potential NHP–drug interactions. The inhibitory patterns among the plants and enzymes were also examined to determine the potency of the extracts and the sensitivity of the enzymes to inhibition. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals and reagents HPLC grade methanol (MeOH), acetonitrile, 95% ethanol (EtOH), methyl p -tolyl sulfide (MpTS), methyl p -tolyl sulfoxide (MpTSO), and methyl p -tolyl sulfone (MpTSO 2 ) were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Ottawa, ON, Canada). Testosterone and 6-β-hydroxytestosterone were purchased from Steraloids Inc. (Newport, RI). 3-Cyano-7-ethoxycoumarin (CEC), 7-methoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)-coumarin (MFC), dibenzylfluorescein (DBF), AMMC, and microsomes derived from baculovirus infected insect cells expressing CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, 3A5, 3A7 or 19, CYP-reductase and/or cytochrome b 5 were purchased from BD Biosciences (Mississauga, ON, Canada). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form (NADPH), furafylline, tranylcypromine, sulfaphenazole, quinidine, diethyldithiocarbamate, bifonazole, and methimizole were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada). Ketoconazole was purchased from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ, USA). 2.2 Plant material and extracts The 17 anti-diabetic plant species ( Table 1 ) were harvested in Mistissini, Quebec, Canada following the instructions of the elders and healers of this community ( Leduc et al., 2006 ). Plants were identified by Dr. A. Cuerrier and voucher specimens were deposited at the Marie-Victorin herbarium at the Montreal Botanic garden, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Air-dried samples were washed and separated by organ parts. The appropriate part was ground using a Wiley Mill with a 2 mm filter (A.H. Thomas Co., Swedesboro, NJ, USA) and extracted twice with 80% ethanol (10 ml/g) for 24 h. The extracts were combined, filtered and reduced to dryness through rotary evaporation and then lyophilization ( Spoor et al., 2006 ). The plant extracts were solubilized in 100% MeOH for the CYP inhibition assays and were tested within two weeks. 2.3 Microtiter fluorometric assays A microtiter fluorometric (MF) plate assay was used to assess the inhibitory capacities of the 17 plant extracts against 11 recombinant CYP isoforms: 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, 3A5, 3A7, and 19. The procedure used was adapted and modified from Ghosal et al. (2003) and Scott et al. (2006) . The assays were performed in 96-well plates with white walls and clear, flat bottoms under red-colored light to minimize the exposure of fluorescent light to photosensitive material. The fluorescence was measured using a Cytofluor 4000 Fluorescence Measurement System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The percent inhibition of each extract was calculated relative to the CYP activity with the MeOH control. The samples were diluted tenfold with water and the final in-well MeOH concentration was 1 μl/200 μl. Extracts were tested in triplicate per assay at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. All diluted extracts in water were freshly prepared daily. The substrates used were CEC (1A2, 2C19), MFC (2B6, 2C9, 2E1), DBF (2C8, 3A4, 3A5, 3A7, 19), and AMMC (2D6), and were dissolved in acetonitrile. The positive inhibitors used were furafylline (1A2), tranylcypromine (2B6, 2C19), ketoconazole (2C8, 3A4, 3A5, 3A7), sulfaphenazole (2C9), quinidine (2D6), diethyldithiocarbamate (2E1), bifonazole (19) and were dissolved in MeOH. Wells were designated as “control,” “control blank,” “sample,” or “sample blank.” The control represented the MeOH vehicle control, whereas the sample represented the extract or positive control. Solution A contained 1.08 mM NADPH and the substrate in 0.25 M potassium phosphate buffer solution (buffer, pH 7.4). Solution B contained the CYP in 0.13 M buffer solution. Solution C was identical to Solution B but instead contained denatured CYP rather than active enzyme (“blank”). A volume of 100 μl of Solution A was added to each well followed by the addition of 10 μl of the extract. Enzymes were thawed prior to being added to Solution B or C which were then immediately aliquoted into the wells at a volume of 90 μl. The plate was then shaken for 3 s, and the initial fluorescence (T initial ) was measured. The plate was incubated at 37 °C between 20 and 60 min and then final fluorescence ( T final ) was measured. The following formula was used to determine % inhibition: 1 − ( sampl e T final − sampl e T initial ) − ( sample     blan k T final − sample     blan k T initial ) ( contro l T final − contro l T initial ) − ( control     blan k T final − control     blan k T initial × 100 % A complete description of experimental conditions for each isoform is provided in Table 2 . 2.4 High pressure liquid chromatography 2.4.1 CYP3A4 Cree extracts (50 μg/ml) were incubated with 100 μM CYP3A4 co-expressed with cytochrome b 5 , 35 μM testosterone, 2.7 mM NADPH and 3.3 mM magnesium chloride (MgCl 2 ) in 0.125 M buffer (total volume of 200 μl) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 75 μl of cold acetonitrile. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm and filtered with PTFE filters (0.45 μm pore; Chromatographic Specialties Inc, Brockville, ON, Canada). A volume of 20 μl of the reaction mixture was injected into a Supelco LC-BD C18 column (5 μm practical size, 250 mm × 4.6 mm; Supelco, Ottawa, ON, Canada) and analyzed using an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system with a diode array detector (DAD). Testosterone and its metabolite, 6-β-hydroxytestosterone, were separated by a gradient eluted method with an initial 35:65 (v/v) ratio of acetonitrile and water and a gradient change to 65:35 (v/v) for 10 min, using a flow rate of 1 ml/min, a column temperature of 37 °C, and the DAD set at 245 nm. Testosterone and 6-β-hydroxytestosterone eluted at 9.5 and 3.8 min respectively. A solution of 10% MeOH was used as the vehicle control for the extracts, and ketoconazole (10 μM) was used as a positive control. 2.4.2 FMO3 The effect of Cree extracts (400 μg/ml) on FMO3 catalyzing activity was characterized by using an S-oxygenation assay with 0.2 mg/ml FMO3, 3 mM MpTS, 1.44 mM NADPH and 3.3 mM MgCl 2 in 50 mM glycine buffer (pH 6.5) in a total volume of 250 μl for 40 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of cold acetonitrile. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm and filtered with PTFE filters. A 20 μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was injected into an Agilent Zarbox C8 column (5 μm practical size, 150 mm × 4.6 mm; Supelco, Ottawa, ON, CA), and analyzed using an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system with a DAD. MpTS and its metabolite MpTSO were separated by a gradient eluted method with an initial 35:65 (v/v) ratio of acetonitrile and water, and changed to 65:35 (v/v) from 2 to 6 min. The reaction was continued for 14 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, a column temperature of 45 °C, and the DAD set at 237 nm. MpTS and MpTSO eluted at 9.3 and 2.9 min respectively. A solution of 10% MeOH was used as the vehicle control of the extracts, and methimazole (3.5 μM) was used as a positive control. 3 Results Most of the ethanolic extracts from the Cree plants were found to be inhibitory towards many of the enzymes examined ( Tables 3–5 ). Inhibition of CYP1A2-mediated metabolism ranged from −5.5% to 45.6% with a mean inhibition of 19.5% ( Table 3 ). The most inhibitory extracts towards CYP1A2-mediated metabolism were Rhododendron groenlandicum > Pinus banksiana > Picea mariana . Inhibition of CYP2B6 from the extracts ranged from −1.8% to 20.2% with a mean inhibition of 7.7% ( Table 3 ). The most inhibitory extracts towards CYP2B6-mediated metabolism were Juniperus communis > Rhododendron groenlandicum > Rhododendron tomentosum . The mean inhibition for extracts against CYP2C8-mediated metabolism was 49.0% with a range from −16.3% to 83.5% ( Table 3 ). The most inhibitory extracts towards CYP2C8-mediated metabolism were Sorbus decora > Lycopodium clavatum > Rhododendron tomentosum . Inhibition of CYP2C9 from the extracts ranged from 14.2% to 97.1% with a mean inhibition of 53.3% ( Table 3 ). The most inhibitory extracts towards CYP2C9-mediated metabolism were Lycopodium clavatum > Sorbus decora > Juniperus communis . Inhibition of CYP2C19 from the extracts ranged from 14.0% to 97.4% with a mean inhibition of 68.4% ( Table 3 ). The most inhibitory extracts towards CYP2C19-mediated metabolism were Lycopodium clavatum > Juniperus communis > Larix laricina . The mean inhibition for extracts against CYP2D6-mediated metabolism was 12.3% with a range from −11.9% to 46.5% ( Table 3 ). The most inhibitory extracts towards CYP2D6-mediated metabolism were Rhododendron groenlandicum > Sarracenia purpurea > Kalmia angustifolia . Inhibition of CYP2E1 from the extracts ranged from −2.1% to 35.3% with a mean inhibition of 18.1% ( Table 3 ). The most inhibitory extracts towards CYP2E1-mediated metabolism were Kalmia angustifolia > Gaultheria hispidula > Rhododendron groenlandicum . Inhibition of CYP19 from the extracts ranged from 1.7% to 39.6% with a mean inhibition of 16.3% ( Table 3 ). The most inhibitory extracts towards CYP19-mediated metabolism were Sorbus decora > Kalmia angustifolia > Abies balsamea . Inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated DBF metabolism from the extracts ranged from −5.2% to 98.2% with a mean inhibition of 58.3% ( Table 4 ). The most inhibitory extracts towards CYP3A4-mediated DBF metabolism were Pinus banksiana > Picea mariana > Salix planifolia . Inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated testosterone metabolism from the extracts ranged from −4.6% to 84.3% with a mean inhibition of 54.6% ( Table 4 ). The most inhibitory extracts towards CYP3A4-mediated testosterone metabolism were Larix laricina > Juniperus communis > Rhododendron groenlandicum ( Tables 3–5 ). The inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated DBF metabolism was slightly higher than CYP3A4-mediated testosterone metabolism, but both had similar mean inhibitions and rankings by the extracts (58.3% vs. 54.6% mean inhibition, 4th vs. 5th ranking respectively) ( Tables 4 and 6 ). Inhibition of DBF metabolism was broader ranging from low to strong inhibition, whereas inhibition of testosterone metabolism typically was mid-range (30–80%). Many of the extracts inhibited both CYP3A4-mediated DBF and testosterone metabolism at a similar magnitude; however several extracts such as Gaultheria hispidula , Juniperus communis , Larix laricina , Picea mariana , Rhododendron tomentosum , Salix planifolia and Sarracenia purpurea , had diverging inhibition towards the two substrates. For example, Larix laricina was the most inhibitory extract towards testosterone metabolism, but ranked tenth in inhibition of DBF metabolism. The mean inhibition for extracts against CYP3A5-mediated metabolism was 63.1% with a range from 11.0% to 90.6% ( Table 4 ). The most inhibitory extracts towards CYP3A5-mediated metabolism were Sorbus decora > Rhododendron groenlandicum > Kalmia angustifolia . Inhibition of CYP3A7 from the extracts ranged from 12.0% to 96.9% with a mean inhibition of 66.4% ( Table 4 ). The most inhibitory extracts towards CYP3A7-mediated metabolism were Juniperus communis > Abies balsamea > Sorbus decora . Inhibition of FMO3 from the extracts ranged from −4.2% to 87.1% with a mean inhibition of 44.0% ( Table 5 ). The most inhibitory extracts towards FMO3-mediated metabolism were Picea mariana > Salix planifolia > Abies balsamea . These extracts and Pinus banksiana extract caused greater inhibition than the positive control (greater than 68.1% inhibition). The decreasing order of the inhibitory activity of the plant species based on the mean percent inhibition of all CYP and FMO activity was: Rhododendron groenlandicum > Sorbus decora > Kalmia angustifolia > Pinus banksiana > Abies balsamea > Picea mariana > Larix laricina > Juniperus communis > Salix planifolia > Rhododendron tomentosum > Lycopodium clavatum > Picea glauca > Alnus incana > Gaultheria hispidula > Sarracenia purpurea > Populus balsamifera > Vaccinium vitis-ideae ( Table 6 ). The total phenolic content of the extracts ( Spoor et al., 2006; Harbilas et al., 2009 ) did not correlate with the degree of inhibition for each enzyme ( Table 7 ). The best correlation was observed with CYP1A2 with a weak coefficient of determination ( r 2 ) value of 0.302 ( Fig. 1 ). Plant species belonging to the Ericaceae family including Gaultheria hispidula , Kalmia angustifolia , Rhododendron groenlandicum , and Rhododendron tomentosum were the most inhibitory extracts towards CYP2E1 ( Table 3 ). For the other enzymes, members of the Ericaceae family caused a broad range of inhibitions and there appeared to be no relation between the plant family and the extent of inhibition. Plant species belonging to the Pinaceae family tended to be more inhibitory towards CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4 and FMO3 compared to the other plant species belonging to other plant families; however this relation was not as strong as the relation with Ericaceaes and CYP2E1 inhibition ( Tables 3–5 ). 4 Discussion 4.1 CYP/FMO3 inhibition Given that the Cree medicinal plants are being used as complementary medicine, it was important to study their inhibitory potencies against a wide range of the drug-metabolizing CYPs. CYP inhibition can prevent the normal metabolism of drugs resulting in a drug dosage which is toxic or inefficient to elicit its pharmacological activity. The inhibitory potential of these Cree medicines towards CYPs or FMO3 has not been previously reported. Combined with the varying substrate selectivity of the drug-metabolizing enzymes and the crude nature of the ethanolic extracts where many constituents with broad physico-chemical properties are expected, testing required the inclusion of a wide range of isoforms. In order to protect traditional knowledge held sacred by the Cree elders and healers, limited information was provided on how the traditional medicines were prepared from these botanicals. Some of the medicines were used topically as poultices, others were consumed but the amounts and dosing conditions was not provided. In the early extraction studies it was noted that the chromatographic profile of the aqueous and aqueous ethanolic extracts were similar. However, the ethanolic extracts had a higher percentage recovery than aqueous extracts and were chosen for further study as a starting point in order to balance the limited dosing information and the need for an in vitro pharmacologic response. Diabetics drug therapy depends on the stage of T2D and the physiological systems that are affected, and may be metabolized by more than one enzyme. Hypertension or renal dysfunctions associated with T2D are treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-II type 1 receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. All of which are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, except for angiotensin-II type 1 receptor blockers and diuretics which are CYP2C9 substrates ( Triplitt, 2006; Siest et al., 2007 ). ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, as well as the CYP2D6 substrates adrenergic β-blockers and anti-arrhythmic drugs, are also used to treat cardiac complications ( Triplitt, 2006; Siest et al., 2007 ). Painful neuropathies are treated with analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticonvulsants which are primarily metabolized by CYP2C8, 2C9, 2D6 or 3A4 depending on the drug ( Ball et al., 1997; Castberg et al., 2005 ). Lipid-lowering HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibric acids are commonly used by diabetics to help lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels to manage cardiovascular disease. Statins are metabolized by CYP2C8 or 3A4; fibric acids do not undergo CYP metabolism ( Spence, 1998; Triplitt, 2006 ). CYP1A2 metabolizes 4–8% of marketed drugs; however many of these are not commonly used by diabetics except for naproxen and acetaminophen which are used to treat pain ( Chang and Kam, 1999; Anzenbacher and Anzenbacherová, 2001; Cornelis et al., 2006 ). The bioavailability of these drugs may be affected when taken concomitantly with Rhododendron groenlandicum , Pinus banksiana , or Picea mariana . The first-line of medications to control glucose levels are the bigunides, sulfonylureas, meglitanides, thiazolidinediones, and α-glucosidase inhibitor anti-hyperglycemic drugs which are mainly metabolized by CYP2C8 and 2C9 ( Kirchheiner et al., 2005; Triplitt, 2006 ). CYP2C8 metabolizes endogenous arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) ( Zeldin et al., 1996; Marill et al., 2000 ). EETs have an influential role in diabetes because they affect both renal function and vascular smooth muscle ( Totah and Rettie, 2005 ), two common systems affected in diabetics. EETs help alleviate hypertension by acting as vasodilators in the vascular system, and also by inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium in the renal tubules to decrease the blood volume ( Sarkis et al., 2004 ). Hypertension is a complication suffered by diabetics, and inhibiting EET production through the inhibition of CYP2C8, may increase hypertension severity. Extracts of Sorbus decora and Lycopodium clavatum had strong inhibitory potencies on CYP2C8 comparable to the positive control ketoconazole, and may have the greatest effect on the metabolism of CYP2C8 substrates. Sarracenia purpurea , Gaultheria hispidula , and Vaccinium vitis-ideae were weak inhibitors and would not be expected to interfere with these substrates. CYP2C9 is important in the metabolism of many anti-hyperglycemic agents, the angiotensin-II type 1 receptor blockers, diuretics, and several statins ( Triplitt, 2006; Siest et al., 2007 ). Extracts of Larix laricana , Sorbus decora , Picea glauca , Juniperus communis , and Lycopodium clavatum should be used with caution in combination with these drugs due to their strong inhibitory potencies towards CYP2C9. The anti-hyperglycemic drugs are important in diabetics as they assist in lowering glucose levels, and inhibition of their metabolism can result in hypoglycemia. All extracts had weak inhibitory potencies towards CYP2D6 activity except for Rhododendron groenlandicum which inhibited 46.5% of CYP2D6 activity. CYP2D6 metabolizes many drugs used to treat cardiac complications including the adrenergic β-blockers which are used to regulate cardiac rhythm ( Triplitt, 2006 ). Inhibiting the breakdown of drugs used to regulate cardiac function can have serious adverse effects in diabetics. Therefore, diabetics should use Rhododendron groenlandicum with caution while taking drugs for cardiac complications. CYP3A4 metabolizes many drugs taken by diabetics such as ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, several statins, and a few anti-hyperglycemic agents ( Triplitt, 2006; Siest et al., 2007 ). Inhibition of CYP3A4 was assessed using two substrates: DBF and testosterone. The differences in inhibition by the extracts may be due to the allosteric and promiscuous nature of CYP3A4, as it has been proposed that CYP3A4 possess multiple substrate binding domains ( Schrag and Wienkers, 2001 ) and that multiple substrates can bind within a single active site ( Kenworthy et al., 2001 ). Kenworthy et al. (1999) have suggested that CYP3A4 probe substrates can generally be categorized into four distinct groups based on their activity patterns in the presence of various CYP3A4 inhibitors to explain CYP3A4's atypical enzyme kinetics. This implies mutually exclusive actions of inhibitors based upon binding to different substrate domains. As some discrepancies in inhibition were observed, the suggested use of multiple CYP3A4 probe substrates for in vitro CYP3A4 inhibition studies ( Kenworthy et al., 1999 ) should be conducted to cover a broader range of interactions with CYP3A4 substrates. Similar inhibition patterns were observed with DBF and testosterone for the majority of the extracts. Strong inhibition was observed with Rhododendron groenlandicum , Abies balsamea , Larix laricana , Picea mariana , Sorbus decora , Pinus banksiana , Rhododendron tomentosum , Kalmia angustifolia , Juniperus communis , and Salix planifolia , and have the greatest potential to interfere with the metabolism of the aforementioned drugs. CYP3A5 has similar substrate specificity and metabolizes the same drugs as CYP3A4 with the same activity or less ( Andrew Williams et al., 2002 ). However, CYP3A5 contributes less to drug metabolism due to its lower concentration in the liver and enterocytes ( Lin and Lu, 1998 ) and as a result, CYP3A5 inhibition may not be as clinically significant as CYP3A4 inhibition. However, unlike CYP3A4, CYP3A5 is present in all human kidneys ( Haehner et al., 1996 ), and hence, may play a greater role in the metabolism of drugs used to treat nephropathies such as ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. Rhododendron groenlandicum , Abies balsamea , Larix laricana , Picea mariana , Sorbus decora , Pinus banksiana , Rhododendron tomentosum and Kalmia angustifolia have the greatest potential to interfere with the aforementioned drugs. CYP2B6, 2E1, 2C19, 3A7, 19 and FMO3 have relatively little pharmacological significance in T2D, as they do not metabolize commonly used anti-diabetic drugs. However, CYP2E1 can generate toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( Cederbaum, 2006 ) that can oxidize DNA, protein, carbohydrates, and lipids ( Cai and Harrison, 2000 ), as well as inactivate nitric oxide which is involved in vasodilatation and decreasing hypertension ( Cai and Harrison, 2000 ). Due to high blood glucose levels, diabetics are more prone to the production of ROS from an increase in glycation reactions ( Kaneto et al., 1999 ). A recent study had reported that CYP2E1 induction was observed in diabetics ( Wang et al., 2003 ). CYP2E1 inhibition by the Cree plant extracts can be viewed as a positive attribute and a possible anti-diabetic treatment as there would be less ROS produced with no NHP–drug interactions. Extracts of Rhododendron groenlandicum , Kalmia angustifolia , and Gaultheria hispidula had the capacity to moderately inhibit CYP2E1. 4.2 Inhibition patterns The decreasing order of inhibition for the enzymes by the extracts of the Cree botanicals was: 2C19 > 3A7 > 3A5 > 3A4 > 2C9 > 2C8 > FMO3 > 1A2 > 2E1 > 19 > 2D6 > 2B6 ( Tables 3–5 ). This is consistent with a study by Zou et al. (2002) , where 25 herbal products were screened for their ability to inhibit various CYP isoforms. CY2C19 was most prone to inhibition, whereas CYP2D6 was the least sensitive, similar to the results obtained in this study. CYP2C and 3A have lower substrate specificity ( Lewis et al., 2006 ) to accommodate a wide range of molecules and were among the most inhibited enzymes in the present study. CYP2C9 and 3A4 have also been found to have flexible active sites which increase their ability to accommodate and correctly bind to substrates ( Anzenbacher et al., 2008 ). Overall, caution is advised when using Cree anti-diabetic NHPs concomitantly with drugs metabolized by CYP2C or 3A isoforms, as they appear to be more prone to inhibition. Inhibition of FMO3 has been reported to be rare ( Cashman, 2000 ) and although our study shows inhibition of 44.0%, this was only evident at very high extract concentrations. The plant species belonging to the Ericaceae family except for Vaccinium vitis-ideae were the most potent inhibitory extracts towards CYP2E1 compared to the extracts belonging to other plant families such as Pinaceae. Future work should include testing a larger number of Ericaceae members to confirm this, and to determine what common constituents may account for the CYP2E1 inhibition. A similar observation was observed with the Pinaceae family and CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4 and FMO3, as many of the Pinaceaes in this study were more inhibitory towards these enzymes relative to the other plant species. However, this relation was weaker than the relation with Ericaceae and CYP2E1 inhibition—the Pinaceaes were typically more inhibitory than other extracts, but were not exclusively the top ranking inhibitory extracts for CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4 and FMO3. Several of the extracts were inhibitory towards more of the enzymes than others. Rhododendron groenlandicum , Sorbus decora , and Kalmia angustifolia had the highest overall inhibitory rankings, and therefore have the greatest potential to interfere with the metabolism of anti-diabetic therapeutic products. These extracts may contain numerous inhibitory constituents or they may contain lipophilic constituents which have a greater capability to access and block enzyme active sites ( Lewis et al., 2006 ). Vaccinium vitis-ideae , Populus balsamifera , and Sarracenia purpurea had the lowest overall inhibitory rankings and would not be expected to interfere with the metabolism of most anti-diabetic therapeutic products. The degree of inhibition for each enzyme was not related to the total phenolic content of the extracts, indicating that the CYP inhibition assays were not reacting to a general non-specific tannin action, as these phenolics have been known to bind to proteins ( Schofield et al., 2001 ). 5 Conclusion Taken together, the findings in this study suggest that several of the traditional Cree plants have a high potential to inhibit drug metabolism and can consequently affect the bioavailability of concomitantly used anti-diabetic therapeutic products. CYP inhibition will not necessarily affect all anti-diabetic drugs as different isoforms can be involved in their metabolism. For example, the Salix planifolia extract is a strong potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and would be expected to interfere with the metabolism of calcium channel blockers or ACE inhibitors. However, it would not interfere with the metabolism of most anti-hyperglycemic agents since it was a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9. It is important to note that the results in this study were obtained by testing crude ethanolic extracts of the medicinal plant. The activity of traditionally prepared medicines may differ from the activity observed in these experiments due to differences in their phytochemical yield as a result of the different preparation methods ( Foster et al., 2005 ). Additionally, healers personalize medicine and may combine two or more of these plants which could potentiate the effects noted in this study. Furthermore, in vitro findings are substrate and condition specific and cannot necessarily be extrapolated to the clinical situation. Nevertheless, the results indicate that there is a potential risk of interactions if these traditional medicines are used with conventional therapeutic products. Several extracts may also have the potential to pharmacoenhance the activity of some medicines.

High-resolution ammonite biostratigraphy, together with sedimentological, stratigraphical, mineralogical data, and ecostratigraphic interpretations, were re-examined to provide evidence for the combined action of tectonics, eustasy and insolation fluctuations on sedimentation in two sections which clearly differ in stratal pattern, both in the average thickness of limestone beds and in the frequency and character of marl intercalations. The detailed analysis of stratal patterns was used to identify and calibrate the influence of the different factors investigated. The identification of significant bedding planes in the sections studied enabled the recognition of eight bundles of beds (major cycles). The analysis and comparison of their internal structure, together with the information about tectonic and eustatic influences, enabled us to interpret the lower part of the sections (bundles 1 and 2) as being forced by interactions between orbital signals and tectonics, the upper part (bundles 6, 7 and 8) as being caused by interactions between orbital signals and eustasy, and the middle part (bundles 3, 4 and 5) as being related mainly to orbital forcing.

According to the result of perimeter drilling survey, three aquifers could be recognized below the landfill; 2.0-3.2m, 4.0-6.0m, and 8.5-12.0m in depth. These aquifers were isolated each other using open standpipe piezometer sealed by bentonite for systematic groundwater monitoring. Trace element composition of groundwater respectively showed that Cu, Zn, Pb, and Se are above the quality standard. Potentially toxic element (PTEs) composition of subsurface sediments collected by the drilling survey was also examined. The concentration of non-metal (B, As, Se) and metal (Ti, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sb, Ba, La, Hg, Tl, and Pb) pollutants is extremely high in the uppermost landfill cover layers and the Aquifer-1 sediments, which is probably derived from the landfill. I. Introduction Groundwater monitoring programme is indispensable after a closure of solid waste landfill to determine the degree to which the landfill capping and closure system is functioning in accord with the design objectives. Main concern is with the excursion/migration of contaminants off the landfill site as leachate or as landfill gas or both. It is essential that the monitoring programme identify the extent to which any excursions/migrations are occurring. The monitoring activities normally include a groundwater monitoring well for detection of off-site migration of contaminants; perimeter monitoring well system, lysimeters under the liner structure, perimeter storm-water ditching system, etc. (McBean et al., 1995). In this paper we report a preliminary result of monitoring data obtained from perimeter groundwater monitoring wells installed at the Sebkhat Sejoumi lakeside of Henchir El Yahoudia landfill, and discuss about the contamination and pollution of groundwater of the area. II. Borehole HY1 and Monitoring Wells The local geology of the area is composed of two geologic systems, Neogene- Paleogene sedimentary rocks and Quaternary lake sediments. The former is a hydrogeologic basement and the later is basin-filling terrestrial deposits consisting of relatively permeable media within the Sejoumi-Manouba hydrogeologic basin. The Sebkhat Sejoumi, an isolated salt lake, is located in the center of the Sejoumi-Manouba hydrogeologic basin, which is accumulating a pile of lake sediments. The sediments consist of unconsolidated to semiconsolidated gravels, sand, silt, clay, marl, and evaporite which are potentially aquifers. The lake water is available in winter (rainy) season but almost completely evaporated in summer (dry) season.",,

The reason for such a common use despite its low strength properties and high porosity is the fact that tuff is lightweight, easy to process and has good isolation properties. Another practical area for tuff in building sector is its use in cement production as pozzolan. Making use of tuffs’ high porosity and of cement production process, what is aimed in this study is enhancement of strength properties of white tuff blocks in the Eskisehir–Derbent Ciftligi region by means of treatment in slaked lime bath. Half of the tuff samples were kept in slaked lime bath for 1 day and the other half were kept for 1 week and then they were subjected to uniaxial compression tests (UCS). The tests were conducted on the sample groups kept for 7 days and 28 days under atmospheric conditions like those of concrete tests. Analysis of variance among the test results showed that it was appropriate to keep tuff blocks in lime-water for a maximum of 1 day and to air-dry them for 7 days. This method proved successful in ensuring a 100% increase in UCS of the white tuffs in the Eskisehir-Derbent Ciftligi region. Keywords Tuff Building stone Ashlar Slaked lime 1 Introduction In the Cappadocia region of Turkey, which has a steppe climate with a great temperature difference between day and night, people have lived in the rooms curved within tuff for years. Dating back more than 1500 years, most of these structures have survived up to today. A significant example among these structures is Midas (Yazilikaya) Monument to the southeast of Eskisehir, which was sculpted by Phrygians in 600 BC. In Anatolia today, tuff blocks produced by means of block cutting method with in situ slicing are used as natural building stones. Having various sizes depending on demand, it is usually cut into 30 × 30 × 60 cm blocks. Most of these ashlar mines are found in the Cappadocia region. There is also an ashlar mine operating in Derbent Ciftligi, Eskisehir. Although no geotechnical studies were found about assessment of tuffs as natural building stones in building sector, there are studies in which physical and mechanical properties of the tuffs from several regions were determined [1–10] . According to these studies, tuffs in Turkey can be described as volcanic rocks with high porosity and low strength. These studies also describe the pink tuffs found in Midas Monument in Eskisehir as having higher strength than those of white tuffs [1,2,5] . Another practical usage area of tuffs in building sector is its use in cement production as pozzolan. Depending on their forming characteristics, pozzolans are divided into two groups as natural and artificial pozzolans. Including mostly pyroclastic rocks such as volcanic tuff, volcanic ash and volcanic glass, siliceous and alumina materials present in nature (which display hydraulic binding property when combined with calcium hydroxide and water after they are made fine-grains) are referred to as natural pozzolans [11] . There are very few studies about the use of tuffs in cement production in Turkey [12,13] . The aim of this study is to enhance strength properties of Eskisehir-Derbent Ciftligi white tuff so that its use as a natural building stone is increased. It was expected that strength properties of tuff could be enhanced by means of filling the pores of tuff having high porosity with any material that could lead to increased strength. A study in the relevant literature where a similar method was employed was conducted by Binda et al. in 1997 concerning the method to choose the most suitable mortar to be used in the injection and repair of stone masonry walls [14] . D’Arienzo et al. conducted a study into consolidation and preservation of new polymeric nanocomposites and Neopoliten yellow tuffs [15] . Also in the same year, Vacchiano et al. did a research on maintenance and preservation of historic buildings of gray tuff with polymeric resin [16] . These studies are based on in situ application aimed at preserving old buildings, whereas the present study focuses on the use of tuff blocks in new buildings. Although many material types could have been used to fill in tuff pores and increase tuff strength, slaked lime was chosen for this study. Tuff’s use in building sector as pozzolan and the well known pozzolanic reaction between pozzolan and lime in cement production played a key role in this preference. 2 Study area and regional geology The Derbent Ciftligi region is situated around 20 km to the southeast of Eskisehir ( Fig. 1 ). The reason why the Derbent Ciftligi region was chosen as the study area is that it is convenient for transportation and there is still an active tuff ashlar mine in it. Sarıiz et al. examined the region geology in 1987 and defined the units in the region as Derbent Ciftligi Ophiolites and Suvatdere Formation. Sarıiz et al. also determined that the clay deposits, a local formation, were formed genetically in a condition where the tuffs and tuffites from Neogene aged lacustrine serial were weathered surficially and ground waters were influential to some extent. Sarıiz et al. further identified the rock types comprising Derbent Ciftligi Ophiolites and Suvatdere Formation units. Accordingly, Derbent Ciftligi Ophiolites are Triassic old and formed by dunites, peridotites and serpantines. Dunites and peridotites transformed into serpantines as a result of fracture deformation. This unit is covered by Pliocen aged Suvatdere Formation. Suvatdere Formation consists of sandstone, tuff, tuffite, marl, sandy limestone and andesitic tuff [17] . 3 Physical and mechanical properties As a part of the study, a group of tests were carried out in order to determine physical, elastic and strength properties of Derbent Ciftligi white tuffs. The tests were performed in accordance with International Society of Rock Mechanics (ISRM) suggestions [18–20] and several relevant Turkish standards [21–23] . The results from these tests are presented in Table 1 . Forming mechanisms of igneous rocks suggest that magma cooling down slowly forms a nonporous structure or one with a bit structure while cooling down quickly leads to structures with high porosity or in other words porous structures like tuff. The test results given in Table 1 show that Derbent Ciftligi white tuffs also possess high porosity. Highly porous structure of tuff is reflected in its unit volume weight and therefore Derbent Ciftligi tuff was defined as a lightweight rock type. In addition, water absorption due to pore ratio was also found to be high. Tuff’s uniaxial compressive strength, which is 5.32 MPa, is classified as weak rock according to ISRM [24] . Really low uniaxial compressive strength of the tuffs within the area could again be associated with its existent porosity. The triaxial compression tests were carried out according to the methods suggested by ISRM [20] . The individual test method was applied. According to the test results, the cohesion and internal friction angle of Derbent Ciftligi white tuff was determined as 1.4 MPa and 43.85°, respectively. Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of tuff samples were determined from the deformability tests during uniaxial compression test [19,21] . The average value of Young’s modulus was found as 2152.37 MPa. Slake durability test has been carried out on 40–60 g samples in total 10. During the test, the samples were rotated for 10 min with a 20 rpm speed. After two cycles, slake-durability index of tuff has been found as 93.80%. Only surface abrasion has been observed on samples. According to Gamble’s classification in ISRM [18] , slake-durability index is medium–high durability. It is interesting to note that although Derbent Ciftligi tuffs’ porous structure and high water absorption property, their slake-durability index was determined as medium–high. 4 Enhancing tuff blocks’ strength properties by keeping them in slaked lime-water bath As it has low strength values but a high level of porosity, enhancing Eskisehir-Derbent Ciftligi white tuff’s strength properties could be achieved by filling rock pores. Various types of material can be tested as filling material or those materials used for maintenance and repair of tuff structures can also be useful [14–16] . Despite all the alternatives for filling process, slaked lime was used in this study. Lime is basically calcium oxide (CaO) in natural association with magnesium oxide (MgO). Calcium oxide is available in nature in the form of limestone which has a large proportion of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) in combination with magnesium carbonate (MgCO 3 ), oxide of iron (FeO), alumina (Al 2 O 3 ) and silica (SiO 2 ). After calcination process at temperature of 900 °C, the calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) in limestone liberates carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to produce calcium oxide (CaO) which is pure lime. When calcium oxide is mixed, or “slaked” with water, calcium hydroxide is obtained [25] . It has many names including hydrated lime, builders lime, slack lime, cal, or pickling lime. Slaked lime is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Ca(OH) 2 . Wide availability of slaked lime, low cost of the material and the method and simplicity of the method were naturally considered in this preference, it was actually tuff’s use as a natural pozzolan and their compatibility is well known due to their pozzolanic reaction, as in cement production that played a major role in choosing slaked lime for this study. Therefore, the method was designed in a way similar to concrete tests. A total of 25 core samples in sizes and with properties allowing for conducting uniaxial compression tests were prepared for experimental studies. The results from the uniaxial compression tests conducted on a total of five air-dried core samples are presented in Table 2 . The chemical composition of the slaked lime used in this study is 80.40% CaO, 0.94% MgO, 0.33% SiO 2 , 0.24% Al 2 O 3 and 0.04% Fe 2 O 3 according to the X-ray spectrometer (XRF) analysis. Saturated solution of slaked lime-water was prepared in a proper vessel for the samples. The pH value for the slaked lime-water bath was measured as 11.5. Twenty of the core samples were taken into slaked lime-water bath. After 24 h, 10 of the samples were taken out of the vessel and left for air-drying. Separate uniaxial compression tests were conducted after 7 days of drying on a set of 5 samples of these 10 samples and after 28 days on another set of 5 samples. The remaining 10 samples were kept in lime-water bath for 7 days so that the effect of keeping in lime-water bath for more than a day on strength could be determined. The samples then were taken out of the vessel and left for air-drying. Like the first set of 10 samples, a uniaxial compression test was conducted on these samples. The 7-day and 28-day drying periods under atmospheric conditions were determined based on applications in concrete tests. The test results are presented in Tables 3 and 4 . Air-dry uniaxial compressive strength of Eskisehir-Derbent Ciftligi white tuffs was determined as 5.32 MPa ( Table 2 ). Keeping in lime-water brought about 64–105% strength increase for the tuff samples. This finding reveals that lime-water bath has a positive effect on increasing strength of the samples. The color difference can be seen from the pictures of the tuff samples before immersion and after slaked lime diffusion for 7 days in Fig. 2 . It has been observed that the color of white tuff samples was getting whitened, and the pores were relatively decreased by filling of slaked lime. 5 Assessment of test results with analysis of statistical variance A test of hypothesis was performed in order to determine whether there was any difference between uniaxial compressive strengths of dry tuff samples and those of tuff samples kept in lime-water bath and then left for air-drying. In the test of hypothesis: H 0 : There is no significant difference between the two mass means. H 1 : There is a significant difference between the two mass means. As the number of samples used in the tests is less than 30 ( n < 30), the hypotheses were compared with t -test value. Table 5 shows results from the t -test performed to determine the differences between the means of uniaxial compressive strengths of the dry tuff samples and the samples kept in lime-water for 1 day and then left for 7 days (for a set of samples) and 28 days (for another set) for air-drying. The test was conducted for 95% confidence level ( P = 0.05). H 1 hypothesis is accepted if the estimated P value is P < 0.05 but H 0 hypothesis is accepted if the estimated P value is P > 0.05. As illustrated in Table 5 , there are significant differences between the means of compressive strengths of the dry tuff samples and the samples kept in lime-water for 1 day and then left for 7 days (for a set of samples) and 28 days (for another set) for air-drying. At a confidence level of 95%, keeping dry tuff samples for 1 day in lime-water enhances their uniaxial compressive strengths. On the other hand, keeping the samples in lime-water for 1 day and then leaving them for air-drying for either 7 days or 28 days seems to have no significant effect on uniaxial compressive strength. It is therefore regarded adequate to air-dry samples for 7 days. Table 6 shows the results from the t -test performed for the differences between the means of uniaxial compressive strengths of the dry tuff samples and the samples kept in lime-water for 7 days and then left for 7 days (for a set of samples) and 28 days (for another set) for air-drying. As can be seen in Table 6 , there are significant differences between the means of uniaxial compressive strengths of the dry tuff samples and the samples kept in lime-water for 7 days and then left for 7 days (for a set of samples) and 28 days (for another set) for air-drying. At a confidence level of 95%, keeping dry tuff samples for 7 days in lime-water increases their uniaxial compressive strengths. On the other hand, leaving them for air-drying for either 7 days or 28 days apparently has no significant effect on UCS. It is therefore considered adequate to air-dry samples for 7 days. Results from the test of hypothesis, which accepted H 1 hypothesis and was performed to investigate whether there was any difference between X ¯ 1 and X ¯ 4 means with the highest t -test values, are presented in Table 7 . As Table 7 shows, keeping dry tuff samples in lime-water for either 1 day or 7 days does not have any significant effect on the uniaxial compressive strength. It is therefore suggested in terms of economical reasons to keep dry tuff samples in lime-water for up to a maximum 1 day and to leave for air-drying for 7 days. 6 Conclusions In this study, it was researched that the strength properties of tuff could be enhanced by means of filling the pores of tuff having high porosity with any material that could lead to increase in strength. For this purpose, Eskisehir-Derbent Ciftligi white tuff samples were used and it was found that they have porous structure and quite low strength properties. Although many material types could have been used to fill in tuff pores and to increase tuff’s strength, slaked lime which is cheap and readily available was chosen for this study. In this preference, tuff’s use in building sector as pozzolan and the well known compatibility of lime with tuff in cement production played a key role. The researchers performed several experimental studies on tuff samples and it was finally determined that slaked lime-water bath increased the strength of tuff blocks. The process of keeping tuff samples in lime-water and supplying the diffusion of slaked lime to the voids in tuff brought about 64–105% strength enhancement for the tuff samples. Statistical analysis of variance was conducted on the uniaxial compressive strength values obtained through keeping tuffs in lime-water process. As a result, it was revealed from the statistical analysis that keeping tuff samples in lime-water for either 1 day or 7 days does not have any significant effect on UCS. In this case, it would be appropriate to keep tuff samples in lime-water for up to a maximum 1 day and to leave for air-drying for 7 days, in terms of economical reasons. Finally, a simple and economic method for strength enhancement of Eskisehir tuff ashlars was introduced and presented in this study. This study is also a preliminary research on strength enhancement of tuff ashlars by keeping wait in a solution such as slaked lime. In order to observe change in the strength of tuff samples, the results of UCS tests were considered. However, different rock properties (such as porosity, deformability, durability, and isolation properties) may be evaluated in further studies. Besides, mineralogical and optical observations in thin sections would also be valuable for realizing the strength enhancement by diffusion of slaked lime. References [1] C. Ayday R.M.

Grosjean'}]","Conventional radiocarbon dates for sediment samples from aquatic systems and of coeval terrestrial samples deviate from each other due to the reservoir effect. The reservoir correction is usually assumed to be constant with time for a specific aquatic system. Our studies confirm that seasonal and secular changes are frequent and are governed by the limnological conditions. Lakes have two principal sources of 14C: atmospheric CO2 and the total dissolved inorganic carbon (TDIC) of the entering groundwater and runoff. The former has values of ca. 100 pMC; the latter usually has a 14C value well below 100 pMC. Atmospheric CO2 enters the lake by exchange via its surface. The proportions of these two kinds of input determine the magnitude of the reservoir correction in freshwater lakes. It is mainly a function of the volume/surface ratio of the lake and, consequently a function of the water depth. The surface of lakes with outflow does not change when sedimentation decreases the depth of the water. The depth of Schleinsee Lake in southern Germany has decreased from 30 to 15 m since ca. 9000 bp. As a result, the reservoir correction has decreased from ca. -1550 to -580 yr. In contrast, the depth of Lake Proscansko in Croatia increased with growth of the travertine dam and the reservoir correction changed from ca. -1790 to -2650 yr during the last 8800 yr. The largest fluctuations of lake levels occur in closed lakes in arid regions when the climate changes from humid to arid and vice versa. As a result, the reservoir correction of the 14C dates for the total organic fraction from Lejía Lake in the Atacama Desert of Chile varied between <-1800 yr and -4700 yr over a period of only 1800 yr between 11,500 and 9700 bp. The corresponding reservoir correction for the marl fraction is much higher. In summary, accurate and reliable 14C dating of lake sediments requires a study of the temporal changes of the reservoir effect by analysis of both the organic and marl fractions. The most reliable 14C dates are obtained from terrestrial plant remains.",,

As better resource utilisation is essential to wise energy management, contrary to the reported cases, surface water pollution by N may be a boon in the GBP. The Agha Jari Formation, in which the Bisheh Zard Basin (BZB) that supplies the GBP with floodwater has been formed, contains NO-3 and NH + 4 in its sandstone, siltstone and marl components. Therefore, it is expected that some of the geologic N dissolved in floodwater, and carried by the suspended load, reach the watertable, and also supply the plants coming in contact with the water and/or sediment. To study the origin of N in the BZB, and investigate the fate of the dissolved and adsorbed N as it travels from the watershed to the watertable, 13 rock samples, 7 floodwater samples and 71 soil samples were collected and analysed for NO-3 and NH + 4. The NO - 3 concentration was higher than that of NH+4 in all of the samples: 77 ppm vs. 38 ppm in the floodwater; 47 ppm vs. 20 ppm in the soil; and 22 ppm vs. 12 ppm in the rocks. Assuming the mean annual inflow of the GBP floodwater spreading system in 10 million m3, the system receives 370 metric tons of NH+4 and 770 metric tons of NO-3 which exceed the N requirement of the small grains if this system is planted to them. As the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has declared the maximum contaminant level of NO-3 - N at 10mg per litre (44.4 mg NO - 3 per litre), and its concentration in floodwater in the GBP is 1.73 fold that amount, purification of the water is in order. High NO-3 consuming plant species might offer an environmentally friendly technology to decrease the deleterious effects of N containing floodwater. The study concerned with the flow of N towards groundwater will be reported later.",,

In the Zlatar Mountain and adjacent areas, below the Middle to early Late Jurassic ophiolitic melange with their overlying ophiolite sheets of the Dinaridic Ophiolite nappe occur mass transport deposits and slide blocks in a radiolaritic-argillaceous matrix. The components in the mass transport deposits and slide blocks consist of Triassic to Early Jurassic carbonates to Middle Jurassic radiolarites. The matrix of these mass transport deposits and slide blocks are late Middle to early Late Jurassic radiolarites, siliceous claystones, and siliceous marls. This paper is focused on the 1) Triassic to Middle Jurassic Hallstatt facies characterisation, 2) age determination and depositional characteristics of the radiolaritic matrix, and on the 3) description of the sedimentary melange character. The slide blocks in the newly defined Zlatar Melange reach several tens to hundred metres in size, occasionally even kilometres. Their stratigraphy and facies evolution allowed the reconstruction of a complete sedimentary succession originating from a distal continental margin setting (Hallstatt facies zone). Deformation and accretion of the Neo-Tethys started with intra-oceanic thrusting in the late Early to early Middle Jurassic. The onset of the west-directed obduction of the accreted ophiolites onto the continental slope and outer shelf is dated as Middle Jurassic. In the Middle Jurassic contractional tectonics reached the outer parts of the shelf and affected the Hallstatt facies zone. Deep-water trench-like basins formed in sequence in front of the advancing nappes and obducted ophiolite sheets, respectively. Thick successions of gravitational redeposited sedimentary rocks accumulated in these trench-like basins. The components derived from the sedimentary sequences of the accreted outer shelf. The former Triassic to Early Jurassic passive continental margin of Adria with its huge Triassic carbonate platforms took a lower plate position in the developing thin-skinned orogen with successive westwards propagation of the nappe stack towards the inner shelf.",,

Vacancy-interstitial recombination is simulated by annihilating those pairs whose radius is less than a specified recombination radius. Also, stopped atoms are moved to their nearest lattice interstitial site if it is not occupied. In this way, a fully physical simulation can be carried out in detail, thus preserving a valuable feature of MARLOWE.

The predictions are compared with Rock-Eval data obtained from the same interval. High resolution comparison of the computed total organic carbon (TOC) curves with gamma ray logs implies that the source rock layers in the Egret Member are mainly shale/claystone and the non-source rock layers are limestone/marl (to the south) and siltstone/sandstone (to the north). These comparisons also indicate that in the mature area some coarse-grained non-source rock layers are filled with hydrocarbons, implying primary migration of oil/gas. Using the average computed TOC value, the thickness of the Egret Member and the average formation density, the mass of organic carbon was calculated at 19 well locations and regional variations examined. Areas with a great mass of organic carbon were identified. The present mass of organic carbon is primarily related to the amount of organic matter being deposited and preserved, but the expulsion of oil/gas may also exert a control. Using 1 wt.% as the lower limit for a source rock, it was observed that the percentage of non-source rock in the Egret Member is generally higher in immature wells (LOM ⩽ 7) than in mature wells, probably as a result of hydrocarbon migration/expulsion after maturation.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/8C/58/BF/8C58BFF79D725EF20185DB6388A4801C.pdf

While a broadly common lithofacies pattern occurs within and between the basins, the detailed response of the basins differs in terms of style of structuring, reservoir architecture and quality of source rock development. The Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous (Tithonian to Berriasian) rift episode is the most significant, with good reservoir sandstones and rich source rocks forming part of this rift sequence.A Late Oxfordian to Kimmeridgian onset warp phase resulted in the development of shallow marine limestones and deeper water organic-rich shales and marls in the Jeanne d’Arc Basin, with non-marine, shoreface and restricted marine sandstones and shales in the Porcupine Basin. The Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous syn-rift episode resulted in the development of sandstone-prone successions which interfinger with good oil-prone source rocks in both basins. Reservoir architecture in both basins was influenced by this episode. Within the Porcupine Basin a range of lithofacies developed, ranging from fluvial channels and bars, to submarine fan turbidites. Within the Jeanne d’Arc Basin, periodic rejuvenation of fault footwalls produced conglomeratic pulses resulting in transverse alluvial fans which interfinger with axially-flowing braid channels and bars within the incised valley fills. Periods of increased subsidence resulted in the development of lacustrine facies and flood plain mudstones.",,

The present investigation was completed to determine the response of the diatom flora to environmental changes before this event. Near the city of Lorca (Province of Murcia, SE Spain) the outcrop area around the Serrata ridge was studied and a stratigraphic section of 125m has been measured and sampled (115 samples). The Serrata ridge is capped by a 25m thick gypsum bed (Gypsum Member of the Serrata Formation). The profile below these gypsum layers comprises marl, sandstone, gypsum and partially laminated diatomite (Varied Member of the Serrata Formation). The frequency of radiolaria, siliceous sponge spicules, silicoflagellates, ebridians, diatoms and diatom species has been determined quantitatively. For the lower 87.5m of the section, which contains sufficiently well preserved diatoms, an age of latest Miocene (6.6-5.3 Ma; Magnetic Epoch 6 and 5) can be assigned by the presence of the diatom species Asterolampra acutiloba and Nitzschia reinholdii, applying the stratigraphic ranges of the species used in the North and Equatorial Pacific and in the Atlantic. In total, 116 diatom species and species-groups have been identified. However, the number of species per sample varies only between 13 and 36 species (a minimum of 300 valves counted). This low diversity, together with a dominance of one species-group, Thalassionema nitzschioides (up to 80%), which tolerates considerable ecological changes (e.g. in salinity) indicate that environmental stress must have prevailed during the sedimentation of the Varied Member of the Serrata Formation. Abundance fluctuations of this species-group, as well as changes in the composition of the remaining diatom assemblage and decreases in abundances of the siliceous microfossil groups, reflect repeated periods of interruption of the still marine influenced deposits before the deposition of thick gypsum layers. Several repetitive changes are indicated, where each cycle is characterized by an increase in meroplanktonic species (e.g. Paralia sulcata, Actinoptychus senarius) and by a contemporary decrease in the holoplanktonic species towards the top, suggesting progressive environmental stress and a shallowing of the basin. Five of these cycles are clearly distinguished characterizing the initial stages of the evaporitic desiccation event in the Lorca Basin. Benthic diatoms are present only in low abundances (2–4%) and show no correlation with these fluctuations.",,

Isopach and structural maps of recent sediments indicate an asymmetry of active subsidence with thick accumulations located closer to the east margin of the basin. Sediment thickness increases within a rhomb-shaped depression whose long-axis is oriented approximately 20°–30° counterclockwise to the regional basin-bounding faults. The morphology and trend of the locus of maximum subsidence suggests tectonic control of the depression.

These data support a domestic origin. The matrix of the bowl contains unaltered, sand-sized, mafic rock fragments with volcanic, subophitic textures. Over 20% of the sand-sized grains consist of angular, unweathered rock fragments, and of these ∼20% are volcanic. Apparently they were added as temper. Electron microprobe analyses show that augite, plagioclase, and, where present, pigeonite, in nine of these have compositions typical of mafic igneous rocks. Geothermometry confirms crystallization at ∼1100°C. Pyroxene discrimination diagrams indicate geological sources ranging from within-plate alkali basalts to within-plate, continental tholeiites. Suitable sources for the temper are rare in Egypt. Both alkaline and tholeiitic, postorogenic (unaltered) late Cenozoic basalts occur in the Cairo area, making this the most likely but not the only possible source for the temper. The pottery may have also originated in Cairo because raw rock materials were moved upstream less commonly than down the Nile. A Cairo provenance for the Karnak artifact is consistent with the everyday movement of people and goods along the Nile between the ancient twin capitals of Memphis and Thebes. These results and the common occurrence of volcanic rocks as temper indicate that microbeam analytical techniques may help narrow the provenance of ancient pottery. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",,

Thirty samples from 6 different wells were examined from the lower Keg River member and 4 from the upper Keg River member using conventional geochemical methods. As maturity differences are absent within the sample set, variations in TOC, Tmax, hydrogen index, organic petrography and extract yields are caused by variability in organic matter input, which is revealed by molecular characterisation using PY-GC-MS. Lower Keg River member bituminous wackestones are excellent potential source rocks containing Types I–II and Type II organic matter. Types I–II organic matter contains large well preserved (up to 200μm in diameter) thick-walled Tasmanites (10–15% of sample) and akinete algal cells indicative of algal blooms within an amorphous bituminite. Type II organic matter contains a higher proportion of degraded alginites/bituminite relative to well-preserved alginites. Extract yields (mg/g TOC) were seen to increase from Types I–II to Type II organic matter. PY-GC-MS revealed that 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene was a major peak in most samples. This is a pyrolysis product arising from β-cleavage of C40 diaromatic carotenoids incorporated within the kerogen during diagenesis. The source of this compound is thought to be from an unknown diaromatic compound with a 2,3,6-/3,4,5-trimethyl substitution pattern and isorenieratene, which is specific to photosynthetic green sulphur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae) suggesting that the photic zone was at least partially anoxic during deposition of these samples. The relative abundance of this compound/n-C11-alkene and organic sulphur (calculated from the thiophene ratio) both increase from Types I–II to Type II organic matter. This trend was grossly similar to the trend seen in the variability of extract yield with hydrogen index. A similar trend for HI and Tmax indicates samples containing a higher proportion of degraded alginites/bituminite relative to well-preserved alginite are more labile than Type I–II organic matter. Upper Keg River member marls contain Type II organic matter, which is characterised by heavily degraded algal material within a bituminous groundmass. Pyrolysates of two of the marl samples contain only low amounts of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, in contrast to the bituminous wackestones, indicating that the depositional environment/source input was different during deposition of the marl samples. Although both marls contain similar organic matter, their pyrolysates were significantly different. One marl (1141.9 m) was highly paraffinic containing dominantly short-chain alkene/alkane doublets, while the other marl (1137.6 m) contained a bimodal n-alkane/alkene distribution and high amounts of alkylphenols, which may be derived from preservation of resistant algal polyphenolic molecules or suggest a terrestrial input.",,

Each of these techniques has advantages and limitations. The advantages and limitations of each are dependant upon site-specific hydrogeoiogic conditions, contaminant characteristics, and local regulatory issues. In general.

Alternatively, on homogeneous sou's of medium to high permeability, or where treatment and disposal of extracted groundwater is difficult or costly, all integrated VE/GWS system may be more appropriate. __ ^Several articles have described the DVE technoiogyTThis paper will focus on a description of the integrated vacuum extraction/groundwater sparging technology. A case study is presented describing results from testing of the VE/GWS technology at a Superfund site in Michigan where groundwater concentrations of VOCs were reduced by 90% during 5 months of sparging operations. INTRODUCTION Vacuum extraction is one of the most widely recommended methods of soil remediation. In this process, vacuum is introduced 10 the subsurface through extraction wells. The subsurface vacuum induces m-situ volatilization and flow of air through contaminated soils. Contaminants partition to the vapor phase, are drawn to the extraction well and finally to the surface for treatment. TJ«_yE [gchnologyalone is typically limited to addressing unsaturated soils. Several innovative technologies have been developed to remediate soils (both saturated and unsaturated) and groundwater contamination in situ. Dual' vacuum extraction combines both a soil vacuum extraction system and a groundwater recovery system operated under vacuum conditions. The technology has been demonstrated to: (I) increase VOC recovery rates, (2) increase groundwater recovery rates, and (3) increase both the groundwater capture zone and the drawdowns when compared with vacuum extraction or pump-and-treat alone. These effects combine to reduce the overall time frame tor site remediation. reducing overall project costs.

VOC contamination was in approximately one-third of the city's production wells and inumerous private wells outside the well field. In 1982. the Verona Field site was listed on the NPL. A solvent irstribuuon facility operated by the Thomas Solvent FCompany was found to be the major source of the contamination. facility was used for the storage, transfer, and packaging of * chlorinated and nonchlorinated solvents from (he mid-1960s to 1984. itConumination of the soil and groundwater at the site resulted from J underground storage tank leakage and surface spills. The contaminaj/tioo from the spills covered an area of approximately I acre m the unstturated zone, and an area of approximately 1 mile by 0.5 mile V; of the saturated zone. Contamination consisted primarily ol* seven ;> compounds; perchloroethylene iPCEl, trichloroethylene (TCE), 1,1,1-tricMoroethane (1,1.1-TCA). 1.2-dichloroethylene (1.2-DCE), ""toluene, xylenes. and ethylbenzene. * to May 1984. the U.S. EPA signed an ROD to implement an Initial Remedial Measure (IRM) at the 'Verona Well Field site in order to protect the city's water supply. The IRM included (1) convening a of the contaminated production wells to blocking wells to prevent further migration of the contaminant plume and (2) installing u air stripping system to treat extracted groundwater. The airstnpping qntem has remained in operation since March 1987, and as of August 1992, it has extracted more than 15,000 pounds of VOCs from the ftoundwater Based on an avenge extraction rate of 350 gpm and a 95% operational time, nearly one billion gallons of groundwater have been extracted and treated. In the fall of 1985. the U.S. EPA signed a second ROD that addressed the Thomas Solvents facility. The ROD specified a coritctive action that included groundwater extraction wells for removing -.£,: contamination from the saturated zone and a VE system for removing ' VOCs from the unsaturated zone. The VE system was placed in operation in March 1988,° and by January 1992. it had extracted more than 44.000 pounds of VOCs from the unsaturated zone. Soil samples collected in January 1992 indicated that VOC levels in the unsaturated zone were below a 100 ug/kg detection limit and were less than or near cleanup objectives for most compounds. The soil are thnwq in Table I. However, significant VOC contamination remained in the saturated zone, since vacuum extraction alone does not affect the contaminated saturated soils. Thus, based on dissolved phase VOC data which were not showing significant decreases, it was apparent that groundwater extraction by itself would not meet the cleanup criteria for the groundwater.

Groundwater flow in most indurated argillaceous rocks is very limited and occurs (if at all) mainly in brittle discontinuities, such as faults. On the basis of surface observations, core logging and hydraulic measurements in boreholes penetrating an argillaceous marl formation in the Swiss Alps, the relationships between internal fault architecture, larger-scale arrangement of the fault network and fault transmissivity are explored. Only a fraction of all faults observed in the cores correlates with water inflow points into the boreholes, and this is taken as evidence of variable transmissivity within each fault. Such flow channeling is also supported by geologic evidence. Stochastic discrete fracture network models are used for the upscaling of measured fault transmissivities, namely for the calculation of effective hydraulic conductivities ( K eff ) of model cubes with lengths of side of 50–500 m. Input data to these models include size, spacing, orientation, heterogeneity (flow channeling) and transmissivity of the faults. Fault size is not well known, but a sensitivity analysis shows that even the extreme assumption of infinite size yields K eff only less than 1 order of magnitude higher when compared to the base case. The effect of different arrangements of flow channels within each fault is also explored but has no appreciable effect on K eff . It is concluded that calculated values for K eff are robust because those input parameters that are least adequately known have only limited effects on the model results.",,

The carbonate sequence begins with a thick dolomite unit of the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age. The following unit is rich in benthic foraminifers and pelecypoda shells. The foraminiferal assemblage comprising Vercorsella laurentii/camposaurii and Pseudolituonella gavonensis indicates a Late Hauterivian to Early Aptian age for this unit. The Late Aptian-Albian facies is characterized by bioclastic wackestones containing benthic foraminifers typical of outer platform environment, such as Spirillinidae and Lenticulinidae. Late Aptian transgression produced a deepening upward sequence, resulting in the deposition of a very fine- grained mudstone/wackestone with hemipelagic organisms: abundant hedbergellids and rare calcispheres. Probably after the Late Albian time, sedimentation took place in slope environments, now represented by graded bioclastic cal- carenites intercalated with hedbergellid and radiolaria-bearing marls and sandstones which fill up and level off the irregularities on the surface of the underlying outer platform limestone with hedbergellids. There is no evidence for emersion of the Eastern Pon- tides carbonate platform portion in the study area. In contrast to this, submarine erosive processes such as gravity-sliding and ero- sional reworking by currents caused this erosional unconformity. Until the Albo-Cenomanian time, both zones of the Eastern Pontides were characterized by the same stratigraphic and tectonic fea- tures. Subsequently during the Late Cretaceous and the Early Cenozoic, in the northern zone a subduction-related magmatic arc com- plex developed while in the southern zone the deposition of siliciclastic turbidites took place. The appearance of such a change, fol- lowing the breaking up of the platform, led to the subdividing of the Eastern Pontides into the northern and southern zones.",,

High-frequency suspended sediment monitoring programs are required to meet this goal, particularly research in highly erodible mountainous catchments which supply the sediment load of the entire downstream fluvial network. However, in this context, analysis of the data and their interpretation are generally limited by many sources of uncertainty in river monitoring. This paper proposes to estimate the global uncertainty of suspended sediment monitoring using turbidimeter in a small mountainous river catchment (22 km 2 ; Southern French Alps). We first conducted a detailed analysis of the main uncertainty components associated with the turbidity approach, i.e. a widely used method to continuously survey the suspended sediment concentration (SSC). These uncertainty components were then propagated with Monte Carlo simulations. For individual records, SSC uncertainties are found to be on average less than 10%, but they can reach 70%. At the flood scale, the mean and the maximum SSC uncertainties are on average 20% (range, 1–30%), whereas sediment yield uncertainty is a mean 30% (range, 20–50% depending on the flood considered; discharge error, 20%). Annual specific sediment yield (SSY * ) was then 360 ± 100 t km −2 year −1 . Uncertainty components associated with the automatic pumping procedure, discharge measurement and turbidity fluctuation at the short time scale were found to be the greatest uncertainties. SSC and SSY uncertainties were found highly site- and time-dependent as they vary significantly with the hydro-sedimentary conditions. This study demonstrates that global uncertainty accounts for only a small part of inter-flood SSC and SSY variability. It outlines the controlling factors of land use, relief, geology and rainfall regime on suspended sediment yields. Keywords Monte Carlo simulations Turbidity Turbidimeter calibration Pumping sampler Sediment yield 1 Introduction Improving knowledge on suspended sediment yields, dynamics and water quality is one of today’s major environmental challenges addressed to scientists and hydropower managers ( Owens et al., 2005 ). These advances will continue in the future as the acquisition of reliable and long-term suspended sediment concentration (SCC) time series are generalised to many hydrometric stations. In mountainous catchments, major fractions of the annual suspended sediment yields (SSY) are transported over a very short time period generally corresponding to several floods (e.g. Meybeck et al., 2003; Mano et al., 2009 ). Therefore high-frequency SSC monitoring is required for reliable SSC and SSY estimates. Nevertheless, a reliable and easy method to obtain a direct, continuous SSC measurement is not currently available. Although great progress is expected with, for instance, the backscatter acoustic method ( Wren et al., 2000; Gray and Gartner, 2009 ), their application is still limited to large rivers and canals. However, problems remain in mountainous catchments where river channels generally show significant and rapid erosion–transport–sedimentation processes, with very high specific sediment yields (suspended as well as bed-load transport). Moreover, measuring suspended sediment dynamics in this restrictive context remains of prime importance, all the more so because these river basins determine the fine sediment delivery to the whole downstream lowland river system ( Milliman and Syvitski, 1992; Hicks et al., 2000; Lenzi et al., 2003; Mathys et al., 2003; Meybeck et al., 2003; Mano et al., 2009; Navratil et al., 2010 ) and they govern reservoir siltation dynamics, water resources and aquatic habitat qualities ( Wood and Armitage, 1997; House and Warwick, 1999; Rees et al., 1999; Valero-Garcés et al., 1999; Packman and Mackay, 2003; Owens et al., 2005 ). Using only SSC samples with a predefined sampling frequency most often leads to large errors in suspended sediment flux (SSF) estimates (e.g., Thomas and Lewis, 1993, 1995; Lewis, 1996; Phillips et al., 1999; Coynel et al., 2004; Moatar et al., 2006 ). Therefore, given the problems of direct high-frequency SSC estimates, turbidity measurement is currently used as a surrogate measurement ( Lenzi et al., 2003; Brasington and Richards, 2000; Mathys et al., 2003; Orwin and Smart, 2004; Stott and Mount, 2007; Mano et al., 2009; López-Tarazón et al., 2009 ). This method is based on the quasi-continuous measurement of turbidity, the sensor being calibrated with suspended sediment collected during many flood events. It remains the easiest and most widely used method for suspended sediment monitoring with high-frequency acquisition ( Wren et al., 2000; Downing, 2006; Némery et al., 2010 ). However, this method shows many limitations and uncertainties within river applications and particularly in mountainous catchments exhibiting a very high SSC and complex spatio-temporal SSY variability. The present paper aims (1) to analyse the major uncertainty components (referred to as UCs) associated with the turbidity approach for suspended sediment monitoring in a highly erodible mountainous catchment; (2) to assess the propagated uncertainty on SSC and SSY with Monte Carlo simulations; and (3) to classify the UCs according to their relative effect on the final results. This work will provide a practical methodological framework that can be applied to other hydrometric stations using similar monitoring techniques. This study was based on a 2-year data set (October 2007–December 2009) collected in a small mountainous river basin, the Galabre River in Southern French Pre-Alps. Nine major uncertainty components (UC1–UC9) associated with turbidity measurement were identified and are summarised in Table 1 : the choice of a turbidimeter (UC1) and its calibration (UC8); the temporal (UC2, UC3) and spatial (UC4) field sampling strategies; the technical field problems (UC5); the field (UC6) and laboratory (UC7) water sample sampling and procedures; and finally, the discharge estimation (UC9). UC2, UC4 and UC9 were considered in this study in comparison to the literature studies and on-site characteristics. Others (UC1, UC3, UC5–UC8) for which literature data were insufficient or not transposable to this context were quantified with specific analyses. Uncertainty propagation applied to long-term time series is quite difficult to perform since the UCs may be correlated with each other; so analytical computations remain very complex. Therefore, Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken to evaluate the combined effect of UCs and to estimate the propagation of uncertainties ( Fig. 1 ; Coleman and Steele, 1999; Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology, 2008a,b; Lacour et al., 2009 ). 2 Suspended sediment monitoring 2.1 Study area The Galabre River (lat.: 44°10′27″N, long.: 06°12′59″E) is a small tributary of the Bléone River in the Rhône River catchment, France (drainage area, 35 km 2 ; Fig. 2 ). Its Mediterranean and mountainous climate (with frost in winter and high-intensity rainfall in summer) and its geology result in a badlands topography, gully development and substantial transfer of sediment. Highly erodible areas cover about 2% of the river basin. Mean annual temperature ranges between 12 and 13 °C at 400 m ASL (above sea level), with a high temperature amplitude between summer and winter (approximately 18 °C). Mean annual rainfall in the catchment varies between 600 and 1200 mm at 400 m ASL. Rainfall is characterised by considerable seasonal variations, with a maximum in spring and autumn ( Mano et al., 2009 ). The catchment is composed of marly calcareous (54%), molasses (31%), black marl (9%), gypsum (4%) and conglomerate (2%). It is overlain by thin soils under grasslands (67%), sparse vegetation (19%) or forests (11%) and it is characterised by a very low human impact (no dams, very low urbanisation). A hydrometric station was installed in October 2007 to survey the suspended sediment dynamics (drainage area, 22 km 2 ). The monitoring station continuously records the turbidity and the water level in order to estimate SSC and discharge with high-frequency acquisition. The site is easy to access and is located in the vicinity of a bridge ( Fig. 2 ). The station studied is part of an international monitoring program assessing the spatio-temporal variability of suspended sediment dynamics in mountainous catchments from the flood scale to the pluri-annual scale, and from 1 to about 1000 km 2 (e.g. Navratil et al., 2010; Gratiot et al., 2010 ). The program is based on continuous measurement of suspended sediment fluxes with high temporal resolution at six hydrometric stations (from 20 to 860 km 2 ) in the Bléone River basin ( Navratil et al., 2008, 2010 ) and at five stations (from 3 to 600 km 2 ) in the Mexican Central Highlands ( Gratiot et al., 2010 , Duvert et al., 2010 ). 2.2 Field monitoring A 24-GHz radar (Paratronic Crusoe®) was installed to continuously survey the water level ( Fig. 2 ). Flow discharges were measured every 3 weeks with the salt (NaCl) dilution method and a current flow meter: 28 flows discharge were measured from 2007 to 2009 ranging from 0.005 m 3 s −1 to 1.18 m 3 s −1 . The surveyed cross-section was assumed to be very stable (i.e. bedrock cross-section without sedimentation or erosion). The water-level discharge rating curve was then built to estimate the discharge time series ( Fig. 4 a). A nephelometric turbidimeter (WTW Visolid® 700-IQ) and a IQ182 sensor net transmitter measured the turbidity in the water flow by infra-red light (860 nm) 90°-diffusion (for low concentrations) and retro-diffusion (for high concentrations). A nephelometric sensor was preferred over a transmission sensor for two main reasons: first it measures a greater SCC range; second, these sensors are less sensitive to fouling. The sensor was built to measure high suspended sediment concentrations in rivers and wastewater-treatment plants; so it was calibrated by the manufacturer with silica (SiO 2 ) in the [0–300 g l −1 SiO 2 ] range, corresponding to a [0–10,000 NTU] range. The [g l −1 SiO 2 ] unit for turbidity is used herein. The coefficient of variation (CV), i.e. the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, of the signal provided by the manufacturer is less than 4%; resolution is 0.01 g l −1 in the [0–25 g l −1 SiO 2 ] range, 0.1 g l −1 in the [25–300 g l −1 SiO 2 ] range. Ultrasonic cleaning of the sensor during the measurement prevents organic and fine sediment fouling. To avoid any bias with natural solar light, the sensor was oriented downward (angle, approximately 30°) in the upstream direction of the river flow and 20 cm above the river bottom. Every 10 min, a data logger (Campbell® CR800) recorded the water level and the turbidity for 1 min (frequency, 1 Hz) and calculated the basic signal statistics: the mean turbidity T ¯ and water level H ¯ , the standard deviations (respectively, σ T and σ H ) and the minimum and maximum values. Data integration during a 1-min time step was found to be a good compromise between the short time scale fluctuations of the signals and their variations at the flood event scale (a few hours in this case study). Statistics were then downloaded daily via GSM transmission and stored at the laboratory. The turbidimeter was calibrated with SSC measurements of water samples collected during several floods. An automatic water sampler (Teledyne ISCO® 3700) containing 24 bottles of 1 l capacity operated approximately 3 m above the intake of the pumping pipe according to the method described by Lewis (1996) : when turbidity critical thresholds T1 = 5 g l −1 SiO 2 and T2 = 20 g l −1 SiO 2 were exceeded, the data logger triggered water sampling at regular intervals: every 60 and 30 min, respectively. Turbidity thresholds and sample frequency were adjusted according to SSC dynamics and seasonal variability. The vinyl pumping pipe was 5 m long and 9.5 mm in diameter; its intake was placed at a fixed height close to the turbidimeter, i.e. 20 cm from the river bottom. The pumping line was purged before and after each sample in order to limit auto-contamination between successive samples. The ideal orientation of the intake would be facing upstream ( Gautheron, 1994 ), but debris fouling and the inability of the sampler to purge the intake line against the flow current makes this orientation impossible ( Lewis and Eads, 2008 ). The turbidimeter was also subjected to calcification resulting in calcareous precipitation on the optic cell. It was then regularly washed with 5% HCl acid. 2.3 Laboratory analysis and data processing One-litre samples were processed in the laboratory using two different methods to estimate SSC (AFNOR T90-105, 1994). The method based on the whole water sample was preferred to the method that uses sub-samples (or aliquot) in order to limit measurement bias associated with operator handling ( Gray et al., 2000 ). At low SSCs (estimated by expert assessment, <2 g l −1 ), the whole sample volume was filtered through pre-weighed fibreglass Durieux filters (pore diameter, 0.7 μm), dried for 5 h at 105 °C and then weighed again with a high precision balance. For higher SSCs (⩾2 g l −1 ), the whole sample volume (water and sediment) was settled; the SSC was estimated by weighing the sample after drying it for 24 h at 105 °C. SSC measurements refer to the total suspended sediment (i.e. mineral and organic fractions). Among the 66 floods recorded during 2007–2009, 38 events were sampled by the ISCO: 354 samples or data pairs { T ¯ ,SSC } were collected during the period of the survey; 283 of them (dataset#1) were collected during 28 events and were chosen to fit a global T-SSC calibration curve ( Fig. 3 a): (1) SSC ( t ) = a · T ¯ ( t ) 2 + b · T ¯ ( t ) + c with a = 0.032, b = 0.262 and R 2 = 0.97. We chose to restrict the T-SSC calibration curves (Eq. (1) ) with c = 0, because the sensor’s ability to survey very low concentrations, i.e. less than 1 g l −1 , appeared insufficient (as expected by the manufacturer). Although this relationship was reliable and applicable for most of the events, T-SSC hysteretic relationships ( Lewis and Eads, 2008 ) were observed during ten flood events. The 71 remaining collected samples (dataset#2) showed visually great scatter from Eq. (1) . Ten T-SSC hysteretic relations were then built and used for further SSC flux calculations of these particular flood events using linear interpolation between two consecutive points of the hysteresis ( Fig. 3 b). These relations were found clockwise or anti-clockwise and are often attributed to variations in sediment and/or water properties and flood types ( Downing, 2006 ; Lewis and Eads, 2008 ). SSC time series ( Fig. 4 a) and suspended sediment flux (SSF) [t s −1 ] were then calculated as follows: (2) SSF ( t ) = Q ( t ) · SSC ( t ) · 10 - 3 Suspended sediment yields, in tons, can then be integrated at the desired time scale: at the flood event scale (referred to as ssy); at annual or inter-annual scale (i.e. SSY). 3 Uncertainty analysis 3.1 Uncertainty components analysis 3.1.1 Choice of a suitable turbidimeter (UC1) Sensor fouling is frequent in rivers, so the choice of the turbidimeter must take into account the auto-cleaning procedure adapted to each site’s characteristics (e.g. fouling by algae, calcification, macro-invertebrate, sediment accumulation) to avoid any lack of data or temporal trend ( Wren et al., 2000; Lewis and Eads, 2008 ). Currently available turbidimeters are mainly limited by their range of measurement. Consequently, the choice of a suitable turbidimeter is mainly governed by the range of SSC that can be measured at the study site. In a mountainous context, with SSC varying within a wide range [0; >500 g l −1 ], this choice remains problematic. The most elaborate but costly solution would be to have two turbidimeters to survey low (less than 1 g l −1 ) and high SSCs (more than 100 g l −1 ). Only lately there are meters on the market that can estimate concentrations higher than 10 g l −1 (i.e. the OBS-3+ concept; Downing, 2006 ). In the present study, only one turbidimeter was used. We controlled (1) the turbidimeter signal trends that would reflect the sensor fouling; (2) the sensor saturation state, i.e. no signal variation for high turbidity range or sensor silting; and (3) that the final SSC and SSY estimates were not too sensitive to the technical limitations of the turbidimeter at low SSCs (in this study, for turbidity <1 g l −1 SiO 2 ). 3.1.2 Turbidity and water level acquisition frequency (UC2) Uncertainty associated with an inadequate turbidity sampling frequency is obviously related to the degree by which the sampling is insufficient ( Moatar et al., 2006 ). One of the major advantages of the turbidity approach, already outlined previously, is that a data acquisition frequency can be selected that is adapted to the river basin’s suspended sediment dynamics. On the hydrographs and turbidigraphs of the flood events, we visually verified that the choice of a 10-min time step was sufficient to record the water level and turbidity peaks with about at least 4–5 time-intervals to define the SSC and discharge peaks. 3.1.3 Turbidity signal fluctuations (UC3) The turbidity signal varies significantly at the flood event scale, but it also shows variations at shorter time scales, i.e. less than 1 min. Therefore, when high turbidity fluctuations are found, an instantaneous turbidity measurement ( T ) may not be adequate to estimate SSC at each 10-min time step. A time-averaged measurement of turbidity, with its dispersion (standard deviation and range of values) were analysed in this study and compared with the flood events’ SSC variability. We then evaluated the origins of this variability and how these fluctuations may contribute to the global SSC and SSY uncertainties. 3.1.4 Representativity of the point SSC measurement (UC4) An important source of uncertainty reported in the literature is that sampling suspended sediment for calibration at a point source does not adequately represent the river’s whole cross-sectional average SSC (e.g. Horowitz, 2008; Lewis and Eads, 2008 ). To calculate the SSY, the assumption is that the SSC measured is representative of the mean SSC across the river section. Obviously, if the monitored SSC is not equal to this mean SSC, an error is produced. In the field, Steegen and Govers (2001) describe an SSC gradient that varies with depth, and the sediment grain size distribution as influencing factors in the accuracy of this analysis. Horowitz et al. (1992) performed depth–width sediment sampling and used regression analysis in order to accurately predict the cross-sectional average from point sources. Lewis and Eads (2008) suggest statistical analysis to determine the need for a correction factor depending on the statistical difference between point and depth-integrated SSC. This bias may depend on the flow turbulence, the sediment concentration and the proximity of a tributary that can lead to a non-homogeneous distribution of suspended sediment in the cross-section. In this study, we will consider the hydraulic conditions at the gauging station and the sediment characteristics to formulate hypothesis about the homogeneity of SSCs at the cross-section. 3.1.5 Technical field problems (UC5) Turbidity measurements are intrusive and can interact with the environment surrounding the sensor. For example, it can produce river flow slowing and silting. Possible temporal signal drift can also be attributed to algal fouling or sensor calcification. Other problems can also lead to missing data or water samples: empty battery, full memory of the data logger, pumping pipe and turbidimeter freezing in winter or being outside of the water flow during dry periods. These technical problems can introduce ambiguity during the data analysis and possible gaps in the data collected. This study will quantify the fraction of missing data that could contribute to underestimating the final SSY. 3.1.6 Field sampling procedure (UC6) and laboratory analysis (UC7) SSC measurements of collected water samples are necessary to calibrate the turbidity sensor. However, these measurements cumulate field uncertainties (UC6) – during the automatic or manual sampling procedure – and laboratory uncertainties during the measurement of the quantity of solid particles (UC7). For example, the pump of the automatic sampler ISCO may not be strong enough and not be able to draw out all the sediment that was flowing past the intake. The effectiveness of the automatic sampler may be limited by the sediment concentration as well as the position and orientation of the intake. According to the SSC dynamics of the river basin, the delay between the end of the turbidity measurement and the beginning of water sampling process (about 10 s during the purge) may introduce a minor bias. In a controlled environment, we first estimated the aggregated experimental standard deviation associated with (1) the automatic sampling procedure (UC6) and (2) the laboratory analysis (UC7). Samples of calibrated SSCs (referred to as SSC_true) in the range of SSCs currently observed in mountainous rivers were built in the laboratory. Clear water (5 l) and dried–crushed sediment (i.e. suspended sediment collected during flood events at the Galabre River) were used to achieve the 0.5, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 150 g l −1 SSC ranges, respectively. We set up a sampling ISCO laboratory station with a representative difference in height between the sampling machine and the water sample: 4 m was used here, a rough average value of all the stations across the project ( Fig. 2 ). The intake was fixed at the middle height of the bucket (about 20 cm) and turned towards the bottom of the 10-l bucket. A paint mixer handle drill was used to keep the water sample agitated and well mixed. Samples of the suspension were taken using the manual ISCO sampling function. We collected 11 samples (250 ml each) for each range of SSC. It is assumed that good homogeneity was achieved in the bucket – taking one sample will not change the overall SSC in the bucket – and that the each subsequent test is as reliable as the first. This hypothesis will be discussed in Section 4 . Laboratory procedures were carried out afterwards to determine the SSC of the pumped samples (see Section 3 ). A comparison between SSC_true and the values SSC_estim, i.e. SSC estimated in laboratory after the sampling process, will thus allow for computation of systematic and random errors. These estimations cumulate the field sampling and the laboratory errors. Two samples (before and after the sampling procedure) for each range of SSC considered were analysed with a Malvern® particle size analyser after being submitted to a 2-min ultrasonic agitation. Next, we evaluated the laboratory analysis UC7 alone in order to detail the previous aggregated uncertainty estimation. Even if a sub-sampling method was not retained, following the recommendations of Gray et al. (2000) , the laboratory processing may be operator-dependent. To evaluate these uncertainties, five samples were used at different SSClab_true values: 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 150 g l −1 . SSClab_true were analysed following the described method (see Section 2 ). The fine sediment used was suspended sediment collected during past flood events (i.e. with equivalent sediment size). A comparison between SSClab_true at the start and the final estimation SSClab_estim, i.e. the value determined by the laboratory measurement, will make it possible to compute systematic and random errors attributed to laboratory procedures. This analysis was not used for the propagation of uncertainty, but instead it helped us better identify which type of uncertainty (sampling procedure with automatic sampler or the laboratory) was the most significant. 3.1.7 Turbidimeter calibration (UC8) T-SSC calibration is an important step for SCC estimation and error propagation. It combines (1) the 1-min turbidity fluctuations (UC3), (2) the sampling and laboratory uncertainties (UC6, UC7) and (3) the influence of other factors than SSC that could contribute to light attenuation (e.g. particle size, shape, mineralogy, aggregation/flocculation, dissolved light-absorbing matter and bubbles). Continuous and long-term SSC samplings during each flood event are then generally required ( Lewis and Eads, 2008; Lacour et al., 2009 ). This recommendation is even more important in mountainous catchments, because sediment sources can significantly vary during a flood event ( Martínez-Carreras et al., 2010 ) – hillslope vs. river channel erosion – and from one flood to another. It is mainly due to the spatial heterogeneity of sediment sources and rainfalls at the river basin scale. Therefore the turbidimeter calibration procedure can be problematic if the different sediment sources require different rating curves. Uncertainties associated with UC8 were analysed in three ways: (1) first, we verified the relevance of the distinction of dataset#1 and dataset#2 in regard to UC6 and UC7; (2) we also evaluated uncertainties on SSC and SSY when T-SSC hysteretic patterns (dataset#2) were not considered, but only the T-SSC global calibration curve (with dataset#1); and (3) we assessed the aggregated uncertainty attributed to the T-SSC calibration curve with Monte Carlo simulations by considering uncertainties on both variables: the turbidity signal’s fluctuations (UC3) and SSC (UC6 and UC7). 3.1.8 Discharge estimation (UC9) Discharge uncertainties remain difficult to assess as they depend mainly on each site’s characteristics, the number of discharge measurements and their range (mainly during baseflow and high flow conditions), and the gauging methods used. It first depends on the geometrical variations of the gauging cross-section (during a flood or in long-term variations). In this study, the Galabre station shows a stable cross-section, removed from any backwater effect, so it shows a reliable stage–discharge rating curve. But, hysteresis in the rating curve could occur, as the slope of the water surface differs in the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph. Discharge errors also depend on inherent gauging method uncertainties (dilution method and velocity measurements). In this study, we did not analyse discharge uncertainties in detail, but instead used different levels of uncertainties chosen in accordance with our site characteristics ( Table 1 ). 3.2 Uncertainty propagation with Monte Carlo simulations A Monte Carlo simulation approach was used to assess the uncertainty of SSC and SSY in regard to the turbidity signal fluctuations (UC3), the automatic sampling procedure (UC6), the laboratory analysis (UC7), the turbidimeter calibration (UC8) and discharge uncertainties (UC9). The Monte Carlo approach involves running a procedure (e.g. a model or data analysis) thousands of times, each time selecting the input variables from statistical distributions representing their uncertainty. The uncertainty distributions for the output variables are then estimated from uncertainty distributions of the selected input variables ( Fig. 1 ). In this study, p = 3000 replications were used as this number was found to be a good compromise between the resulting stability and the computation time. First, we randomly selected p turbidity time series { T ¯ ( t ) } p within the distribution defined by P T ¯ ( t ) , σ T ¯ 2 ( t ) (steps 1 and 2, Fig. 1 ). Standard deviation estimation of the mean turbidity T ¯ ( t ) can be expressed as σ T ¯ ( t ) = σ T ( t ) / n with n = 60 measurements at 1-Hz, and it naturally decreases with increasing n . Uncertainty associated with SSC sampling and laboratory measurement can be expressed as a statistical distribution P k · SSC i ; σ SCC i 2 with SSC i , the suspended sediment concentration measurement of a water sample i ; k , the systematic bias and σ SCC i , the standard deviation (steps 3 and 4). At step 5, we randomly selected p 2 sets of pairs { T ¯ ,SSC } p 2 with the p time series { T ¯ ( t ) } p defined at step 2. These data sets were used to fit p 2 calibration curves (polynomial equation) and p 2 hysteretic relations (step 6). At steps 7 and 8, we estimated p 2 time series { SSC ( t ) } p 2 and the SSC ¯ ( t ) and its standard deviation σ SSC ( t ). Next we estimated, for each flood event observed during the October 2007–December 2009 period, the p 2 mean SSC { SSC mean } p 2 and p 2 peak of SSC { SSC max } p 2 . The statistical distribution of Q ( t ) was expressed as a uniform distribution u ( ( 1 - θ ) · Q ( t ) ; ( 1 + θ ) · Q ( t ) ) . We used the 10-min time-step discharge measurement Q ( t ) (step 9) and the uncertainty distribution u ( ( 1 - θ ) · Q ( t ) ; ( 1 + θ ) · Q ( t ) ) to randomly select p time series { Q ( t )} p (step 10). We next estimated p 2 replications of SSF( t ) with Eq. (2) (step 11), i.e. { SSF ( t ) } p 2 . Finally at step 12, we calculated p 2 suspended sediment yields for the October 2007–December 2009 monitoring period (referred to as { SSY } p 2 ) and p 2 suspended sediment yields for each flood event (i.e. { ssy } p 2 ). 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Uncertainty component analysis 4.1.1 Choice of a suitable turbidimeter (UC1) We first verified that our material was well suited to the study site. The turbidity uncertainty (provided by the manufacturer) was low given that it was less than 4% for the entire range of turbidity. The sensor had never been saturated during the 2007–2009 study period; the maximum turbidity observed was 58 g l −1 SiO 2 and the maximum SSC was 130 g l −1 ( Fig. 4 a). No signal trend was observed. Finally, we found that 95% of the total SSY was transported with SSC > 1 g l −1 ( Fig. 4 b). As a result, the low range of turbidity (i.e. with low resolution) did not significantly influence the final SSY estimate. UC1 was then considered here to be negligible ( Table 1 ). 4.1.2 Turbidity and water level acquisition frequency (UC2) The flood event hydrograph and turbidigraph (see an example in Fig. 5 a) show that the turbidity and the water level acquisition frequency, i.e. 10-min time step, were well adapted to the river basin dynamics with at least 4–5 records to define the water level and turbidity peaks. UC2 was then considered here to be negligible ( Table 1 ). These high-frequency recordings were found to be essential in this environment since roughly 90% of the annual sediment yields were produced during less than 2% of the time, i.e. about 7 days per year ( Fig. 4 c). 4.1.3 Turbidity signal fluctuations (UC3) During the 2007–2009 period of the survey, standard deviation σ T ( t ) of turbidity measured every minute were found in the [0–8 g l −1 SiO 2 ] range. Relative error expressed with the coefficient of variation (CV) decreases with increasing mean turbidity ( Fig. 5 b). Turbidity fluctuations were 0.01 g l −1 SiO 2 in the [0–25 g l −1 SiO 2 ] range and 0.1 g l −1 SiO 2 in the [25–300 g l −1 SiO 2 ] range. In the [0–1 g l −1 SiO 2 ] range, the variability CV was bounded at about 1000%, so the variability may be mainly controlled by the sensor characteristics, i.e. its precision, resolution and ability to measure the turbidity within a low range. The distinctive break for lower CV at about 1 g l −1 could be attributed to the two distinct technologies used to measure the turbidity for low and high SSCs. Two behaviours, A1 and A2, were observed ( Fig. 5 b). Within the A1 area, CV decreased from 100% to less than 1%. Within the A2 area, the signal fluctuations were much greater than in the A1 area (10–1000%), but much less frequent (10% of turbidity measurement greater than 0.001 g l −1 SiO 2 ). For regime A1 and A2, the variability could be attributed to the SSC fluctuations near the point of measurement in the river. Indeed, burst-like turbulent motions observed in rivers are highly effective in vertically mixing suspended sediment ( Lapointe, 1992 ) and therefore probably introduce high SSC fluctuations. Bed load or saltation that may occur at the vicinity of the sensor ( Lewis and Eads, 2008 ) could also induced these signal fluctuations. It is less likely that a rapid change in suspended sediment properties occurs (e.g. light absorption, mineralogy, size), as these changes instead may depend on the spatial distribution of rainfalls and contributive erosion areas observable at larger time scales, i.e. the flood event scale. The higher fluctuations observed for regime A2 could be explained by additional factors such as the temporary debris fouling (leaves, branches or air bubbles) that may be temporary attached to the glassware or passed in the reading window of the turbidimeter. The turbidity fluctuation can provide a simple and useful recording quality indicator. For example, during the flood on 20 April 2008 ( Fig. 5 a), the signal quality was highly variable during this single flood event. The first part of the flood shows a very stable turbidity signal with intermittent high pulses at a few measurements; CV is almost constant throughout the turbidity range (about 5%), corresponding to the A1 area ( Fig. 5 a and b). On the contrary, very high fluctuations can be observed during the recession curve: CV increases from less than 5% up to more than 300% in a few hours, corresponding at this time to the A2 area. This change could be attributed to debris fouling (e.g. leaves, branches) disturbing the turbidity signal. 4.1.4 Representativity of the point SSC measurement (UC4) In this study, we assumed that SSCs are relatively homogeneous in the sampling cross-section, so turbidity measurements and automatic samples were considered to be representative of average cross-section characteristics. Indeed, the river reach showed high channel slope (3.1%) and flow velocity generally higher than 1 m s −1 at the sampling cross-section. Furthermore, grain size analysed on four contrasting flood events (57 samples collected by the ISCO sampler on the right bank) showed that suspended sediments were mainly composed of clay and silts with on average D 10% = 2 μm, D 50% = 20 μm; and D 90% = 90 μm. The fine sand fraction (>125 μm) on average accounted for less than 5% of the sediment sample volume; however, for specific flood events, the fine sand fraction can increase significantly (up to 66%) with a simultaneous increase in discharge and SSC ( Fig. 6 ), which could then refute the hypothesis of SSC homogeneity. However, as the flow remains very turbulent during most of the flood events and the gauge station is distant from sediment sources, the sediment and water are assumed to be well mixed. We therefore hypothesise that for most flood events, there is a little or no bias at the point sample ( Table 1 ), as suggested by Lewis and Eads (2008) . 4.1.5 Technical field problems (UC5) In this study, the uncertainties or missing data associated with sensor fouling and equipment problems are at least corrected with linear data interpolation, or at best avoided given the real-time survey of the measurements (e.g. GSM or phone network) and the frequents visit to the study sites. Finally, from October 2007 to December 2009, the missing turbidity or water level data totalled less than 3%, which could be a lot, given that 90% of SSY is generated during 2% of the time. But, in our study, technical problems only occurred during small flood events which did not generated significant sediment yields at the other gauging stations in the catchment ( Fig. 2 ). Therefore, UC5 was assumed negligible ( Table 1 ). 4.1.6 Field sampling procedure (UC6) and laboratory analysis (UC7) Aggregated automatic sampling (UC6) and laboratory (UC7) uncertainties combined systematic and random errors ( Fig. 7 a). Systematic error was on average 17%, i.e. the mean ratio between SSC_true and SSC_estim was 1.17 for SSC, ranging from 0.5 to 150 g l −1 . The random error was a mean CV = 17%, but standard deviation (Std_SSC) increased with SSC ( Fig. 7 b): (3) σ SSC _ estim = 0.23 · SSC _ estim 0.79 ( r 2 = 0.96 ) The normality of the distribution of each SSC range was positively tested with the Shapiro–Wilk test ( p -value = 0.05). Then SSC_true can be defined as N 1.17 · SSC _ estim; σ SCC _ estim 2 , and can be implemented in the Monte Carlo simulation flowchart ( Fig. 1 ). Laboratory uncertainty estimated alone (UC7), i.e. corresponding to the repeatability of the laboratory measurements, corresponded to only a small part of the previous aggregated UC6 and UC7. Indeed, systematic error attributed to laboratory manipulations was on average 3% vs. 17% for the aggregated UC6 and UC7. Moreover, random error associated with UC7 alone remained small: CV = 5% on average for the entire range of SSC_estim (range, 1.5–16%). Systematic errors may correspond to a loss of sediment during operator handling in the laboratory, whereas random error may correspond to uncertainties associated with the water volume measurement and the dried sediment weighing. Therefore, the uncertainties associated with the automatic pumping procedure predominated. During the automatic sampling tests carried out in a controlled environment, no significant deviation in SSC was evidenced from the 1 st to the 11th collected sample for the 5 g l −1 , 50 g l −1 and 150 g l −1 SSC ranges ( Fig. 7 c). Only for the 10 g l −1 and 100 g l −1 SSC ranges was a slight reduction in the SSC_true/SSC_estim ratio observed for the first four samples, whereas an increase was observed for the 0.5 g l −1 range. While the mixing conditions achieved in the bucket with the paint mixer handle drill seem to be the same for most of the samples, we have no idea whether sufficient homogeneity was achieved from the bucket (i.e. all sediment in suspension with no stratification) or whether significant particle siltation occurred at the bottom of the bucket that could introduce systematic and random errors. These problems are inherent to this type of experimentation and can at best be limited, but cannot be totally prevented. Nevertheless, they may be quite similar to field sampling bias, as referred to UC4. The sediment size before the sampling ( D 50% = 63 μm; D 10% = 12 μm; D 90% = 158 μm) remained very stable among the different ranges of SCC sampled in the bucket (CV, approximately 1%). Fig. 7 d shows a systematic and well-marked reduction in the sand-sized fraction volume, but an increase of the clay and silt-sized fractions during the pumping phase for all SSC ranges. The experimentation provides a quantification of UC6 and UC7 aggregated uncertainty. UC6 remains the most significant uncertainty. However, it is difficult to asses whether the systematic and random errors during the sampling process can be attributed to the siltation processes of the sand-sized fraction at the bottom of the 10-l bucket or to the pumping process itself. The intake location and orientation may play an important role depending on the hydrodynamic conditions, the power of the automatic sampler and its elevation (4 m in our test, 3 m in the field), the length of the pipe (5 m) and the purge efficiency before and after the sampling may also be very important. These problems, evidenced here in a controlled environment, are of course quite similar in a natural river environment (e.g. Thomas, 1985 ). 4.1.7 Turbidimeter calibration (UC8) Here we asses the turbidimeter calibration relevance by comparing the field and laboratory uncertainties combined (UC6 and UC7) with the residuals associated with Eq. (1) ( Fig. 3 ). For dataset#1, i.e. the data set used to fit the global calibration curve, the residuals for turbidity less than 1 g l −1 SiO 2 were very high (>600%). But, residuals significantly decrease for higher SSC: on average 24% in the [1–20 g l −1 SiO 2 ] range and 10% in the [20–200 g l −1 SiO 2 ] range. For dataset#2, i.e. the data set used to build hysteretic relations, residuals were found logically higher as the flood samples that composed the hysteresis relations were initially chosen with respect to their large scatter from the calibration curve: on average 35% in the [1–20 g l −1 SiO2] range and 50% for greater turbidity values. We cannot conclude if these hysteresis only occur during particular floods, or if they are present for all large events with very high SSCs, but only visible (or sampled) for some large events. We confirm that a relevant and univocal relation exists between turbidity and SSC for most of the collected samples ( Fig. 8 a) as uncertainties were found greater than residuals for 96% of the dataset#1 samples (>1 g l −1 ). Uncertainties were greater than residuals for only 67% of dataset#2 samples (>1 g l −1 ; Fig. 8 a). We must point out that turbidity measurements associated with dataset#2 show very low variability during the 1-min measurement (A1 area; Fig. 5 b); consequently, residuals could not be explained by turbidity measurement fluctuations (turbidimeter fouling, etc.). For dataset#2, other factors than SSC uncertainties were responsible for T-SSC hysteretic relations: the sediment size variations, their mineralogy and colour ( Foster et al., 1992 ). Another reason could be the heterogeneity of SSCs at the survey cross-section for specific flood events (UC4). Indeed, hydraulic conditions can discriminate these two data sets for discharges less than 0.1 m 3 s −1 ( Fig. 8 b): contrary to dataset#1, many samples of dataset#2 are associated with very high SSCs. So for highly concentrated flow with low discharge, SSC stratification in the water column could occur and explain these hysteresis patterns. As evidenced previously during the automatic sampler test, the SSC estimation would be highly dependent on (1) the hydrodynamic conditions at the vicinity of the ISCO pipe intake ( Thomas, 1985 ), (2) but also its type, orientation and placement within a cross-section and (3) its deviation from the turbidimeter. Furthermore, the intake usually cannot be positioned in one place so that it will sample correctly for all hydro-sedimentary conditions. In the present study, the intake was located at a fixed height above the bed (20 cm), so that it would sample a different relative position in the vertical concentration gradient for a different water level. This problem probably influenced the relationship between the sampled and actual concentration for specific flood events and as a result the T-SSC relationship. 4.1.8 Discharge estimation (UC9) We estimated the uncertainty of individual gauging with repeated measurements at about 5%; it corroborates well with past studies (e.g. Sauer and Meyer, 1992 ). Water level recording error with radar was less than 1 cm. Contrary to other submerged water level probes (e.g. pressure probes), suspended sediment cannot affect the water level measurement because the radar altimeter is non-submerged. A discharge uncertainty of 10% is expected by the international hydrometric requirements ( European ISO EN Rule 748, 1997; Baldassarre and Montanari, 2009 ). In highly turbulent rivers or torrents, i.e. this study, this uncertainty is probably under-estimated during base flows and flood peaks; it may reach more than 20% (e.g. McMillan et al., 2010 ). In this study, we considered different ranges of discharge uncertainty: 5%, 10% and 20%. The statistical distribution of Q ( t ) was expressed as U ((1 − θ ) · Q ( t ); (1 + θ ) · Q ( t )), with θ values of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2. 4.2 Uncertainty propagation analysis 4.2.1 Global SSC uncertainty Since the analytical computation remains very complex for global uncertainty analysis, Monte Carlo procedure appears to be the most-adapted method. However, such method assumes complete intra- and interdependence of the considered variables. The strong dependency between hydrological and sedimentary processes involves that the variables and/or errors are strongly correlated between each other and time-autocorrelated. Consequently, the current approach did not account for these last effects. We made the assumption that turbidity was normally distributed, so statistical distribution of mean turbidity T ( t ) ¯ can be expressed as N T ( t ) ¯ ; σ T 2 ( t ) / n ; with n = 60. This assumption is likely plausible for the measurements with low fluctuations (A1 area at Fig. 5 b), but it is probably not verified for turbidity measurements with obstacles that may introduce extreme and transitory turbidity peaks (A2 area; Fig. 5 a). For these specific records (i.e. less than 10% of the total records), a log-normal distribution would have been more suited. Monte Carlo simulations provide the mean and standard deviation of SSC every 10 min ( Fig. 9 a). We defined the uncertainty of variable SSC( t ) as: (4) Δ SSC ( t ) = 2 × σ SSC ( t ) SSC ( t ) ¯ × 100 A coverage factor of 2 was used in this study, i.e. a numerical factor used as a multiplier of the combined standard deviation, in order to define the 95% confidence interval associated SSC( t ). The same definition was applied to all the other variables used ( Table 2 ), except Q ( t ) and q max . The uncertainty for these last variables, with a 100% confidence interval (uniform distribution), can be written as: (5) Δ Q ( t ) = Δ q max = θ × 100 SSC uncertainty (ΔSSC( t )) were very high for SSC < 1 g l −1 ( Fig. 9 a) because of the high turbidity fluctuations that generally occur (see Section 5 ). In the SSC [1–10 g l –1 ] range, the median ΔSSC( t ) was 10% (range, 4–67%) and in the [10–100 g l −1 ] range, the median ΔSSC( t ) was 5% (range, 3–25%). The solid lines observed on Fig. 9 a are some autocorrelation of uncertainties during flood events with very high concentrations. At the flood event scale (66 events), the median uncertainties on peak SSC (ΔSSC max ) and mean SSC (ΔSSC mean ) were 18% and 17%, respectively ( Fig. 9 b). These uncertainties varied greatly from one flood to another, from 1% to more than 30% for both indicators. As mentioned above, we knew that SSC uncertainty was site-dependent; these results indicate that SSC uncertainty is also highly time-dependent and varies significantly depending on the hydro-sedimentary conditions. Therefore, although a mean uncertainty value is always useful for operational studies, such information remains incomplete and sometimes unreliable. 4.2.2 Global SSY uncertainty Uncertainties on the time-cumulated SSF( t ) (ΔSSF( t )) are relatively stable over time, with a mean value of 15%, 19% and 29% (with Δ Q ( t ) = 5%, 10% and 20% respectively) for the period studied ( Fig. 10 a). Specific sediment yield SSY * is 360 ± 100 t km −2 year −1 for the site studied (considering Δ Q ( t ) = 20%). Sediment yield uncertainties estimated at each flood event (referred to as Δssy) were in the same range (median = 27%; with Δ Q ( t ) = 20%) but showed high variations (range, 22–47%) from one flood to another, depending on turbidity fluctuations, discharge magnitude and the T-SSC calibration relation used ( Fig. 9 b). Classical relations found in the literature (e.g. Lenzi et al., 2003 ) can now be expressed with their uncertainties. For instance, for the relation between SSY and the flood peak discharge ( q max ; Fig. 10 b), cumulated uncertainties only explain a small part of the fit residuals (on average 10% of residuals for all the flood events). This evidences and confirms that physical factors (e.g. land use, soil erodibility, rainfall regime) play an essential role in the sediment transport dynamics and variability. Global uncertainty on SSC and SSY will thus help define and discriminate the main factors controlling the suspended sediment dynamics. 4.2.3 Calibration curve sensitivity analysis To estimate the significance of the use of T-SSC hysteretic relations for the turbidimeter calibration (UC8), we estimated SSY following two approaches: (1) in the first step, we used both the T-SSC calibration curve and the hysteretic relations following our initial methodology, and (2) second, only the T-SSC calibration curve was used (Eq. (1) ). SSY during the study period was slightly under-estimated (about 5%) if T-SSC hysteretic relations were not used. This difference was much greater at the flood event scale, as on average 23% of difference was observed (range, 3–60%). Therefore, in most of cases, hysteretic relations are required when studying the inter-event variability of sediment yields. If the studies aimed only at surveying the annual or inter-annual sediment loads, a calibration of the turbidimeter with a T-SSC calibration curve is acceptable, with occasional verification during the following flood events. 4.2.4 Turbidity measurement sensitivity analysis We considered two turbidity record strategies, with n = 60 and n = 1 (step 1, Fig. 1 ), and we studied how this choice affected the final estimation of sediment yields. If only a single turbidity value is recorded ( n = 1) every 10-min time step, median Δssy were 30%, vs. 18% with n = 60 (with Δ Q ( t ) = 10%; Fig. 9 b). This analysis shows that averaging turbidity for 1 min makes it possible to significantly decrease measurement uncertainties. 4.2.5 Uncertainty classification and recommendations This study helps to quantify the uncertainties and proposes monitoring recommendations designed to minimise uncertainties. UC1 and UC2 can be negligible with good knowledge and experience of river monitoring. UC3 can also be very low if mean and standard deviation of turbidity are recorded. This method will first minimise the uncertainties and second provide the signal variability as a useful quality indicator of the turbidity signal. In the present study, SSC homogeneity in the water column of the cross-section was reached for the major flood events; however, doubt remains for very specific flood events (low discharge and high SSCs). UC5 can be avoided with a real-time monitoring and data validation with other monitoring stations located in the same catchment. However, this experiment showed that in a mountainous environment system failures are frequent and very difficult to prevent (e.g. during storm events or flash floods). When these occur during high intensity floods, SSY estimations may be severely affected despite relatively short data gaps. Uncertainty in the laboratory (UC7) remains low when using the entire collected sample ( Gray et al., 2000 ). UC8 can also be very low if considering T-SSC hysteretic relations. UC8 will be largely dependent on UC4 and the heterogeneity of the sediment sources. Turbidimeter calibration needs to be checked regularly, particularly if the study focuses on the SSY at the flood event scale. Finally, SSY uncertainties are very dependent on method of automated water sampling (UC6) and discharge estimation (UC9). It is difficult to suggest a solution to minimise the field sampling uncertainties because the main factor governing this uncertainty was not identified; however, we can suggest reducing the length of the pipe line of the automatic sampler and its height above the water surface. The orientation and depth of the pipe intake remain problematic because in many cases, it is placed according to on-site constraints. It also seems important to evaluate the field and laboratory uncertainties for each site because they probably depend on suspended sediment size, i.e. sand-sized fraction errors may be greater. For UC9, we naturally suggest respecting the discharge monitoring basics in rivers, with a focus on the choice of a stable gauging cross-section removed from any backwater effect, the long-term survey of the whole range of flow discharge, the choice of a non-submerged water level recorder in the mountainous context to avoid silting and measurement corrections. 5 Conclusions Suspended sediment monitoring cumulates many uncertainties from field monitoring to the SSC and SSY computation procedure. Assessing uncertainties is therefore required because it would help distinguish the spatio-temporal variability of SSY attributed to natural (e.g. rainfall, erodibility, relief) or anthropogenic factors (e.g. land use change) from the variability attributed to monitoring uncertainties. Furthermore, the quantification of these uncertainties is of prime importance to a relevant calibration and validation of physical-based hydro-sedimentary models as well as for pollutant transport estimations in rivers. In this paper, we have estimated the uncertainties on SSC and SSY monitored with the turbidity approach at a hydro-sedimentary station located in a mountainous context. SSC uncertainties are on average less than 10% for individual records (with a 95% confidence level), but it is highly variable, reaching approximately 70%. Flood indicator value uncertainties (SSC mean , SSC max ; Table 2 ) are about 20% on average. Annual specific sediment yield SSY * is 360 ± 100 t km –2 year –1 (with Δ Q ( t ) = 20%). Uncertainty of sediment yields at the flood event scale (Δssy) is about 15%, 19% and 29% depending on the level of uncertainty on discharge estimates (respectively 5%, 10% or 20%). This study provides a practical methodological framework applicable to other hydro-sedimentary stations in order to propagate the uncertainties from the turbidity measurement to the final SSY estimates. These results are rigorously relevant at the station studied, as we have shown that uncertainties mainly depend on factors varying with time and site features. However, we project that these results could provide a rough but useful order of magnitude of uncertainties valuable at other monitoring stations built on the same model, with similar SSC range, sediment type and equipment.

Three aerosol lidar instruments participated in the campaign: the Aerosol-TemperatureLidar (AT-lidar) from Goddard Space Flight Center, the MobileAerosol-ban-Lidar (MARL) from Alfred Wegener Institute, and the TMF-Aerosol-Lidar (TAL) from Jet , Propulsion Laboratory. Four in-situ backscatter sondes from University of Wyoming were successfully launched. During the campaign a total of 414 hours of lidar data were acquired. The majority of the lidar observations were performed concurrently. Altitude profiles of backscatter ratio of the stratospheric background aerosol layer at altitudes between 15 and 25 km and of high-altitude cirrus clouds at altitudes below 13 km are analyzed and discussed. Cirrus clouds were present on 16 of the 26 campaign nights. The vertical extent and structure of optically thin cirrus layers were studied with high temporal and spatial resolution. From autecorrelation functions of backscatter ratio profiles clouds length scales of 562 m vertically and 20.6 min horizontally are derived. The wavelength dependence of aerosol depolarization is compared to T-matrix calculations. On the basis of a sulfuric acid aerosol model, color ratio profiles obtained from two wavelength lidar data are compared to the corresponding profiles derived from the sonde observations. We find good to excellent agreement between the in-situ observations and AT-lidar and MARL data with respect to backscatter and color ratio. Comparison of measured aerosol backscatter coefficients with model results are consistent with a lognormal particle size distribution with total number density N = 10 ~ m ~ , median radius rs = 0.075 pm, and geometric standard deviation a, = 1.86 below an altitude of about 19 km.

 Company (APC) works necessitates that water quality in the area be monitored and evaluated based on the local geology and
 hydrogeology. The objective of this paper is to provide information on the past and present status of the main aquifers under
 exploitation or planned for future development. Two main aquifers are discussed: the Safi water field, presently being operated,
 and the Dhiraa water field, which is being developed. The aquifer developed in the Safi water field is shallow and fed by
 the Hasa fault system, which drains a significant portion of the Karak mountains. This aquifer seems to be well replenished
 within the core, where no obvious long-term degradation in water quality can be identified. However, in the low recharge areas
 within the distal portions of the alluvial fan, there has been a degradation in water quality with time. The degradation is
 caused by the dissolution of the Lisan Marl, which is present at the outskirts of the fan system, based on hydrochemistry
 of water in the wells. The Dhiraa field is a deep (800–950 m) aquifer drilled specifically for the extraction of brackish
 water present in the Kurnub aquifer. Available data indicate that there are at least three distinct water types within this
 field. These water types are variable in quality, and there may be potential for mixing of these waters, thus affecting the
 quality of the freshest waters presently available. Tritium and oxygen isotope analysis indicate that the water is old and
 possibly nonrenewable.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/2D/01/F9/2D01F9936DD93EEAA7FDB56FC807CD7D.pdf

These springs run off overflows of the Vaucluse karstic system. Their impluvium extends over the limestones of the eastern part of the Montagne de Lure; this karstic area contributes, with the runoff entering into the losses, to the underground flows of the Fontaine de Vaucluse. As it rose eastwards, the drainage network of this giant karst was halted by the faults of the Aix-en-Provence lineament, in which very strongly deepening marls form a barrier around the aquifer. This is new evidence of the part played by the Hercynian-inherited lineament framework in limiting giant karsts of the Vaucluse-type, as is the case for the Alpine carbonate platforms in which they have developed.",,

On cord blood derived eosinophils, Fc epsilon RI expression started at 1 week of culture and increased to reach a plateau at 3 weeks of culture. Fc epsilon RII/CD23 appeared slightly later, after 2 weeks of culture, and the percentage of Fc epsilon RII/CD23-positive eosinophilic cells increased and stayed in plateau. Fc epsilon RI expression on cord blood derived eosinophils was downregulated after culture with interleukin-2 (rhIL-2), interleukin-4 (rhIL-4), rhIL-5, interferon-a (rhIFN-alpha), interferon-gamma (rhIFN-gamma). In contrast, the expression of Fc epsilon RII/CD23 on cord blood derived eosinophilic cells was upregulated after culture with rhIL-4 rhIL-5 and rhIFN-gamma, and downregulated with rhIL-2 and rhIFN-alpha. Fc epsilon RI was expressed on about 30% normal donor eosinophils as well as on normodense eosinophils from HES patients but significantly decreased on hypodense eosinophils. In contrast, Fc epsilon RII/CD23, expressed on a very small proportion of normal donor eosinophils, increased from normodense to hypodense eosinophils. These results suggest that Fc epsilon RI on eosinophils might represent one differentiation antigen expressed relatively early, with decreased expression through maturation or activation, whereas Fc epsilon RII/CD23 might rather be considered as a marl;er of eosinophil activation.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/BB/6D/04/BB6D04D38B1C07A851B43884DCDCE514.pdf

 hydric soils. This paper traces the experiences soil scientists and other wetland scientists had in Florida to properly identify,
 understand, and use hydric soil indicators to identify those soils that fit both the hydric soil definition and the hydric
 soil criteria. The hydric soil indicators that properly identify soils that fit the definition and criteria in Florida are
 as follows: hydrogen sulfide, organic bodies, stratified layers, muck, mucky texture, dark surface, stripped matrix, redox
 concentrations, gleyed matrix, depleted matrix, iron manganese masses, umbric epipedon, thick mollic epipedon, or marl. Exact
 thicknesses, depths, percentages, and colors that are required for each of the hydric soil indicators have been developed.
 Because of the knowledge gained from intense observations of morphological features in soils for hydric soil determinations
 scientists were able to transfer this technological ability to include the estimation of seasonal high water tables for all
 soils in Florida.",,

In order to investigate this phenomenon, enrichment levels and distribution patterns of metals (e.g. Zn, Cd, V) and radionuclides in the underlying soils, alluvium, and yellow marl bedrock were determined and compared against those in the PG stockpiles. The Ra-226, Pb-210, and U-238 in soil reached peak concentrations of 1.5 pCi/g, 2.0 pCi/g, and 1.1 pCi/g, respectively. These elemental concentrations are similar to their concetrations in the uncontaminated soils, whereas the concentrations of these elements exhibit higher concentrations in PG and are as follows: Ra-226= 18 pCi/g, Pb-210= 19 pCi/g, and U-238= 4 pCi/g. The elements Cd, Zn, and V have maximum concentrations of 3 mg kg(-1), 69 mg kg(-1) and 62 mg kg(-1), respectively, in the soil's layer. These elemental concentrations are relatively lower than in uncontaminated soil and the PG. The degrees of mobility of the determined elements in soils were classified into three categories: elements with high mobility are Se, Mn, Pb, and Cr; those with moderate mobility are Co, Ni, As, Hg, Cu, V, and Zn; and those with low mobility are U, Cd, Pb-210, Ra-226, and U-238. Following correlation analysis, R-mode factor analysis was applied in conjunction with mineralogy to understand the geochemical variability of the soil. Four main meaningful factors were extracted: a detrital quartz factor, a clay minerals factor, a carbonate factor, and a terrigenous minerals factor. To investigate the spatial distribution patterns of the elements, a contour mapping technique was applied, allowing the following conclusions: (1) The elements Pb-210, Ra-226, and U exhibit similar distribution patterns; (2) Cd and Cu show similar distribution patterns; (3) As and V exhibit similar distribution patterns; and (4) no observed trend was observed for Cr. Generally, the results revealed that potentially toxic metals and radionuclides are not contaminated in soils related to the phosphogypsum stockpiles, and the soils of the Eshidiya area do not contain potentially toxic metals and radionuclide concentrations that threaten the surrounding ecosystem.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/EA/03/E7/EA03E78B2D6DC24F9923F2BF2AF4D559.pdf

The lower part of the central basin fill is comprised of marls, siltstones, sandstones and conglomerates. They record the pulsed infill of the predominantly freshwater 'Lake Megara' by progradation of a network of shallow multichannel streams, which drained a western hinterland containing ultrabasic rocks, cherts and limestones.

The overlying ?Pleistocene alluvial clastics were deposited by a NW-flowing system and thicken markedly into a major basin-bounding fault. Deposition of these fluvial deposits was interrupted towards the top of the sequence by the rapid deposition of monomict limestone breccias of debris flow origins, which are believed to mark a catastrophic event.

Stratigraphic analyses allow characterizing three tectosedimentary units. Units 1 and 2 are dominated by clastics lithofacies, and are separated by an unconformity and the correlative conformity. Unit 3 is formed of tufa and micritic limestones and represents a sharp lithological change throughout the area. Total thickness is 120 m. These units are involved in two NNW-SSE Alpine trending, kilometric-scale structures: 1) the Niguella fault, that put into contact Triassic rocks, in the footwall, with Cenozoic rocks, in the hanging-wall, and 2) the Niguella syncline, subparallel to this fault, with strata dips between 19 degrees up to 70 degrees. In units 1 and 2, four facies associations represent deposition in proximal to middle alluvial fans, from local reliefs, and a braided fluvial system with limited floodplain, running southward; both environments record minor fluvial and lacustrine carbonate deposition. Three other facies associations represent dominant carbonate deposition, either palustrine-fluvial-lacustrine or lacustrine settings. In the three units, oncoid and phytoclast rudstones formed in shallow, low-sinuosity channels and pools with extensive tufaceous palustrine areas, where hydrophilous plants throve. In contrast, micritic limestones with ostracods and marls correspond to offshore dominant carbonate lacustrine deposition in still and permanent lakes. Thus the overall sedimentary system evolved from dominant alluvial-fluvial to dominant lacustrine carbonate environments through time. These facts, along with calcrete development in Units 1 and 2, indicate increasing precipitation and probably the passage to a hydrologically-closed lake basin through time. The Niguella fault played as a normal fault at the early Jurassic and during the Cenozoic compression it promoted the formation of a hanging-wall syncline basin through buttressing of the NE block against the fault. This scenario conditioned the distribution and extent of the Miocene lithofacies through space and time, and the location of depocentres. Decreasing tectonic activity through the studied interval favoured fluvial incision, capture of the Mesozoic aquifer, and then outflow of ground water rich in Ca2+ and HCO3-, thus favouring widespread carbonate deposition, and finally the expansion of the lake area.",,

Abstract: A 25 m thick section of shallow-subtidal early Bajocian sandstones to early Oxfordian limestone-marl-alternations with sponge-microbialite-buildups of the middle shelf has been in- vestigated at Neumarkt i.d.Opf. (Franconian Alb, Bavaria). The ammonoid faunas prove the presence of the Humphriesianum-, Parkinsoni-, Koenigi-, Jason-, Lamberti- und Bifurcatus-Zone. Further ammonite zones should be present as derived from correlation with the adjacent section Sengenthal. A biostratigraphic gap is evident only for the Upper Bathonian to the early Lower Callovian. The microfacies of the sediments reflects the increasing distance to the coast and a change in palaeogeography including the connection of the south German and Polish seas by the Regensburg strait, change in currents and a progressive opening to the Tethys. A step-by-step increase in water depth is suggested. Changes in thickness of the Bajocian-Bathonian at short distances result from a submarine erosional relief formed during the lowermost Bajocian. Iron ooids probably formed at the sediment-water interface in an poorly agitated environment. Disconformities and condensations in the early Bajocian to early Oxfordian are considered to result from transgressive pulses and sea-level highstands. In the case of the Parkinsoni- to early Zigzag-Zone, the early Koenigi-Zone and the Lamberti-Zone these condensations coincide with eustatic sea- level highstands. In addition, late parts of transgressive pulses and sea-level highstands are characterized by the formation of phosphorite. A regression is only indicated for the late Sauzei/ early Humphriesianum-Zone. The change from limonite- to glaucony in sedimentation coincides with the opening of the Regensburg strait during the Lower Callovian.",,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/1796/211/1250/53e99ed1b7602d9702799c35_1.pdf

Magnetites are the most important carrier of the remanence in both records. The transitions are recorded in two components; a low temperature and a high temperature component. The two components do not represent the geomagnetic field because the changes in these components take place at lithological boundaries. In addition, the directional changes do not completely match directional changes of the same transitions recorded in Calabria, some 250 km away. The character of the virtual geomagnetic poles paths is probably caused by smoothing of the stable directions before and after the transitions. The directional changes as well as the smoothing mechanism can be explained by the diagenetic magnetite formation model (Van Hoof et al., 1992) in which shortly after burial, the remanence carried by newly formed secondary magnetites is superposed on the initial remanence carried by primary magnetite.",,

Some nappes involve a Meso-Cenozoic sedimentary cover, which starts with Upper Triassic-Hettangian continental redbeds (Verrucano), followed by Sinemurian neritic limestones and, up to the Oligocene, by marly-calcareous pelagic strata. Locally, Upper Triassic evaporites have been recognised. In the Sant’Angelo di Brolo valley, a peculiar sedimentary succession characterised by about 80 m of graded sandstones overlies the Verrucano redbeds. It has been described by Duée [1969] who ascribed it to the Alì Unit. Later on, Thery et al. [1985] interpreted the sandstones as fluvial deposits, Norian-Rhetian in age on the basis of pollens, and correlated them with the Sardinian « Keuper ». The finding of some ammonites and few nannofloras in the siliciclastic succession allow us to reach quite different conclusions. One ammonite specimen, collected in the uppermost part, shows morphological affinities with Spinammatoceras (M) tenax (Vacek), reported from the Middle Aalenian L. murchisonae Zone. Within the calcareous nannofossils, the presence of Lotharingius umbriensis in the lower part of the succession indicates an age not older than late Pliensbachian. However, the upper part of the same succession is characterised by the occurrence of Hexalithus magharensis, Triscutum tiziense, Watznaueria contracta, whose FO is early Aalenian. The petrographic study evidences that sandstones have two compositional groupings : a quartzose (quartzarenite to sub-litharenite) petrofacies of the continental redbeds (Verrucano), and a quartzo-feldspathic (feldspathic quartz-arenite to sub-arkose) petrofacies of the marine sandstones. The redbeds represent deposition by low gradient rivers and are similar to the composition of the Torrente Duno Fm in the Longobucco Group of the Sila Unit sedimentary cover. Their sources include abundant reworked quartz, felsitic volcanic, and low-grade metamorphic terrains. The overlying Middle Liassic-Aalenian marine sandstones testify an abrupt change in composition, reflecting changing source terrains. Its composition, including oversized feldspar grains, suggests gneissic/plutonic source terrains, added to the quartzose and metamorphic sources of the underlying fluvial sandstone. Identical changing detrital modes is testified in the Liassic formations of the Longobucco Group. These sandstone detrital modes mark the evolving early Jurassic rifted-continental margin of the Neotethys ocean. The studied succession shows characteristics unknown elsewhere in the Peloritanian Units, such as the presence of Mesozoic siliciclastic sediments younger than the « Verrucano » redbeds and the lack of terrains in carbonate platform facies above them. It has been deposited in a basin close to emerged areas, in which a clastic supply persists at least until Aalenian. Therefore, the Jurassic palaeogeography of the Peloritanian domain was more articulated than previously thought: pelagic areas were close to continental regions which supplied with siliciclastic detritus narrow basins, confined in grabens or half-grabens between emerged lands and sea-mounts. In the whole Jurassic of the Calabria-Peloritani Arc, siliciclastic marine terrains are known only in the Sila Unit. Here, Middle Carixian-Lower Domerian marls and sandstones in slope facies and an arenaceous turbiditic succession – late Domerian-early Toarcian in age (Longobucco Group) - have been described [Teale et Young, 1987]. There are close similarities in lithologies, tectono-sedimentary evolution, age and petrographic characters between these two sequences. The studied succession cannot be ascribed either to the Mandanici Unit, or to the Alì Unit. In fact, these units are affected by Alpine metamorphism and their Alpine cover is characterised by Upper Triassic evaporites followed by Jurassic and Cretaceous pelagic limestones and radiolarites. Its original bedrock is probably represented by the phyllites and marbles of the Piraino Unit, recently identified in the same region. In conclusion, the Sant’Angelo di Brolo succession was deposited in a marine environment between Pliensbachian (or Sinemurian) and Aalenian. Thus, both the late Triassic age and the fluviatile environment proposed for these terrains must be abandoned, as well as their correlation with the Sardinian « Keuper ».",,

For most of its route, the tunnel passes through Keuper marl with irregular mudstone, some clay, and some ground water, and there was one fault on the route. Both bores were required to proceed in parallel, and the pilot tunnel was later enlarged into one of the bores. The ground in the first 900m was more favourable than expected, and there were very few problems working through the fault. Considerable water pressure was met soon afterwards, which took several weeks to control. Excavation faces and sidewalls were stabilised with Spraymec shotcrete equipment, 4-8m long rockbolts, steel arches, and steel mesh reinforcement.

The range of lithologies investigated included dolomite and chalk [IR (insoluble residue)<10%], marl, shale (IR=70-85%) and sandstone (IR>90%). The results show that K-bearing clay fractions often have K-Ar ages similar to the suggested age of deposition, which means either supply of land-derived authigenic K-bearing clays or synsedimentary diagenetic authigenesis, or both. This K-Ar synsedimentary signal is recorded in clay fractions from the whole range of studied lithologies and stratigraphic units. Among the clay minerals, the synsedimentary K-Ar signature was recorded and retained in illite/smectite of the <2-mu m and <0.2-mu m fractions. A prominent synsedimentary signature is found in K-feldspars, from shaly and especially from calcareous rocks, which is substantiated by their authigenic origin based on idiomorphic crystal morphology and their limited size distribution (4-10 mu m) Post-depositional closure of the K-Ar system is indicated by ages up to 15 Ma younger than the stratigraphic age in different lithologies from dispersed localities. A distinct late diagenetic (20-25 Ma younger) event is recorded in the formation of authigenic K-feldspar within Upper Cretaceous chalk and shale. In the IR and >10-mu m fractions the K-Ar ages reflect the contribution of detrital mica and feldspar which accompanies the kaolinite-dominated samples. The overall results differ considerably from K-Ar age patterns observed in deep-sea sediments, a difference which may be connected with the occurrence of brines in these shelf deposits.

Some nappes involve a Meso-Cenozoic sedimentary cover, which starts with Upper Triassic-Hettangian continental redbeds (Verrucano), followed by Sinemurian neritic limestones and, up to the Oligocene, by marly-calcareous pelagic strata. Locally, Upper Triassic evaporites have been recognised. In the Sant’Angelo di Brolo valley, a peculiar sedimentary succession characterised by about 80 m of graded sandstones overlies the Verrucano redbeds. It has been described by Duée [1969] who ascribed it to the Alì Unit. Later on, Thery et al. [1985] interpreted the sandstones as fluvial deposits, Norian-Rhetian in age on the basis of pollens, and correlated them with the Sardinian « Keuper ». The finding of some ammonites and few nannofloras in the siliciclastic succession allow us to reach quite different conclusions. One ammonite specimen, collected in the uppermost part, shows morphological affinities with Spinammatoceras (M) tenax (Vacek), reported from the Middle Aalenian L. murchisonae Zone. Within the calcareous nannofossils, the presence of Lotharingius umbriensis in the lower part of the succession indicates an age not older than late Pliensbachian. However, the upper part of the same succession is characterised by the occurrence of Hexalithus magharensis, Triscutum tiziense, Watznaueria contracta, whose FO is early Aalenian. The petrographic study evidences that sandstones have two compositional groupings : a quartzose (quartzarenite to sub-litharenite) petrofacies of the continental redbeds (Verrucano), and a quartzo-feldspathic (feldspathic quartz-arenite to sub-arkose) petrofacies of the marine sandstones. The redbeds represent deposition by low gradient rivers and are similar to the composition of the Torrente Duno Fm in the Longobucco Group of the Sila Unit sedimentary cover. Their sources include abundant reworked quartz, felsitic volcanic, and low-grade metamorphic terrains. The overlying Middle Liassic-Aalenian marine sandstones testify an abrupt change in composition, reflecting changing source terrains. Its composition, including oversized feldspar grains, suggests gneissic/plutonic source terrains, added to the quartzose and metamorphic sources of the underlying fluvial sandstone. Identical changing detrital modes is testified in the Liassic formations of the Longobucco Group. These sandstone detrital modes mark the evolving early Jurassic rifted-continental margin of the Neotethys ocean. The studied succession shows characteristics unknown elsewhere in the Peloritanian Units, such as the presence of Mesozoic siliciclastic sediments younger than the « Verrucano » redbeds and the lack of terrains in carbonate platform facies above them. It has been deposited in a basin close to emerged areas, in which a clastic supply persists at least until Aalenian. Therefore, the Jurassic palaeogeography of the Peloritanian domain was more articulated than previously thought: pelagic areas were close to continental regions which supplied with siliciclastic detritus narrow basins, confined in grabens or half-grabens between emerged lands and sea-mounts. In the whole Jurassic of the Calabria-Peloritani Arc, siliciclastic marine terrains are known only in the Sila Unit. Here, Middle Carixian-Lower Domerian marls and sandstones in slope facies and an arenaceous turbiditic succession – late Domerian-early Toarcian in age (Longobucco Group) - have been described [Teale et Young, 1987]. There are close similarities in lithologies, tectono-sedimentary evolution, age and petrographic characters between these two sequences. The studied succession cannot be ascribed either to the Mandanici Unit, or to the Alì Unit. In fact, these units are affected by Alpine metamorphism and their Alpine cover is characterised by Upper Triassic evaporites followed by Jurassic and Cretaceous pelagic limestones and radiolarites. Its original bedrock is probably represented by the phyllites and marbles of the Piraino Unit, recently identified in the same region. In conclusion, the Sant’Angelo di Brolo succession was deposited in a marine environment between Pliensbachian (or Sinemurian) and Aalenian. Thus, both the late Triassic age and the fluviatile environment proposed for these terrains must be abandoned, as well as their correlation with the Sardinian « Keuper ».",,

The example discussed in the paper is from the Coastal Plain aquifer of Israel where most attention has been given until recently to salinization due to seawater encroachment. The present study revealed that large amounts of salt have been added to this aquifer along its eastern boundary which is in close proximity to a syncline filled by Tertiary chalks and marl. The saline water is characterized by high tritium levels and a stable isotope composition which differs from that of local rains. It is suggested that intensive irrigation with water imported from the Sea of Galilee induced flow in old fractures and in solution channels developed in the underlying chalks. These channels are filled with soluble salts which accumulated during the Holocene in the Tertiary aquitard and were mobilized as a result of increased irrigation of overlying soils. The soluble salts reached groundwater and ultimately flowed into the adjacent sandy Coastal Plain aquifer. Overpumping of the Coastal Plain aquifer caused continuous lowering of the groundwater table enhancing flow and considerable transport of solutes from the adjacent aquitard.,,

Rates of methane oxidation were calculated on the basis of oxic incubations by using the anoxic emissions as an estimate of the maximum potential flux. This technique indicated that methane oxidation consumed up to 91% of the maximum potential flux in peat sediments but that oxidation was negligible in marl sediments. Oxygen microprofiles determined for intact cores were comparable to profiles measured in situ. Thus, the laboratory incubations appeared to provide a reasonable approximation of in situ activities. This was further supported by the agreement between measured methane fluxes and fluxes predicted on the basis of methane profiles determined by in situ sampling of pore water. Methane emissions from peat sediments, oxygen concentrations and penetration depths, and methane concentration profiles were all sensitive to light-dark shifts as determined by a combination of field and laboratory analyses. Methane emissions were lower and oxygen concentrations and penetration depths were higher under illuminated than under dark conditions; the profiles of methane concentration changed in correspondence to the changes in oxygen profiles, but the estimated flux of methane into the oxic zone changed negligibly. Sediment-free, root-associated methane oxidation showed a pattern similar to that for methane oxidation in the core analyses: no oxidation was detected for roots growing in marl sediment, even for roots of Cladium jamaicense, which had the highest activity for samples from peat sediments. The magnitude of the root-associated oxidation rates indicated that belowground plant surfaces may not markedly increase the total capacity for methane consumption. However, the data collectively support the notion that the distribution and activity of methane oxidation have a major impact on the magnitude of atmospheric fluxes from the Everglades.",,

The author wishes to suppress by this polemic article the appearance of papers written without reliability required in science. In a detailed analysis to which the article of S. Leszczynski, K. Malik, M. Kedzierski (further as LMK) is submitted the slips and mistakes are treated step by step and the correctness of the conclusions drawn is questioned. The most important reservations will by given below. 
1. The authors have not defined accurately the aim of the investigation undertaken. It may be assumed that the purpose of the research was to obtain merely new data (as it was underlined in the title of the paper) without the intention to elucidate the problems unsolved, as e.g. the raised problem of the nonturbiditic origin of some layers of calcarenites and calcilutites (cf. Kotlarczyk, 1985), particularly of beds in which cross-laminae (nota bene not observed by the authors) are formed by heavy minerals concentrations (Wieser, 1974). Undertaking the solution of this problem required of course microscopic examination, localization of the diagnostic sedimentary structures on the stratigraphical profiles and their statistical description, finding diagnostic features being characteristic of mud turbidites (e.g. according to the suggestion of Piper & Stow, in Einsele et al. eds. 1991), and carrying out a discussion on the genesis of the cross lamination with heavy minerals in turbidites. In place of this the authors have confined themselves to quoting the structures observed which is not sufficient to undertake a decision on the single-turbiditic model of the genesis of all the calcarenite and calcilutite layers. 
2. In order “to make their opinion precise” the authors investigated in general one (sic !) profile of the Hoiownia Siliceous Marls (futher on as HSM) -“Kanion” and two profiles of the Kropiwnik Fucoide Marls (further on as KFM) - “Dolinka” and “Wiar”, while they investigated in details only the first profile (ca 50 m) and selected sections of the remaining two (totally ca 12 m) which constituted 1/18 and 1/26 part relatively of the KFM sediment sequence of these profiles. In the “Dolinka” profile the boundaries of the KFM complex accepted in literature had not been taken into consideration while the younger than KFM complexes were included in the analysis (Fig. 1). 47 samples were collected to investigate the chemical composition of the marls and in 25 samples analysis of nannoflora was carried out (only these last ones were localized, namely in the “Kanion” and “Wiar” profiles solely). Both the range of investigation carried out and the sampling of the profiles is insufficient and unrepresentable. It is unjustified to draw on this basis general conclusions referring to the mechanism of sedimentation and the stratigraphy of both lithosomes. Diversity of the results meaning is deepened by the fact of joint characteristics (i.e. of both HSM and KFM complexes) of the chemical composition, of sedimentary structures, and succesion of the identified members of Bouma sequence in the calcilutites as well as the comprehensive characteristics of the remaining lithologies. This makes it impossible to seize the conceivable differences between the complexes. 
3. The authors have in majority presented falsely (LMK, Table 1) my opinions refering to the age of the boundaries of lithosomes being in elaboration (Fig. 3) as well as the location of the Early/Late Maestrichtian boundary (LMK, Fig. 2) which I have always placed below the olistoliths of the Wegierka Marls. 
4. In both marls complexes the autors have distinquished 9 lithofacies without giving a clear quantitative criteria for their differentiation. The classification suggested is imposible to be applied objectively. Without the required evidences the authors accept the presence of pelagites in both marls sequences and without any ground write about interturbidites occuring allegedly in the bedding rhythms. The latter boundaries have been determined arbitrally whereby the authors were guided by the diminishing diameter of the grains while within one calcilutite bed by some unrevealed rules. The detailed profiles, presented by the authors, of very short sections of both sequences (LMK, Figs. 4-8) gave no basis to arrive at the conclusion about the presence of various order sedimentation cycles (LMK, p. 58) and apart from this no generally known methods were applied to discover the cycles. In the lithofacial description the authors emphasized the presence of noncalcareous shales in HSM complex. From the four (sic !) chemical analyses of the shales from HSM it results, however, that besides the noncalcareous there occur here also poorly calcareous shales which is in accordance with earlier statements of other autors. As in KMF also noncalcareous shales occur besides the calcareous ones the suggestion of the authors to consider the calcium content of the shales as a criterion of differentation of the both complexes is groundless. The authors rather freely use the petrographies terms by naming e.g. as marls also the rocks with a CaCO(3) content from 14 to 25%. 
5. The conclusions referring to the biostratigraphy of the complexes under investigation are mostly ungrounded. This refers also to the main thesis of the article according to which the age of the Rybnik Flysch (the complex occuring between HSM and KFM) is confided to the CCI6 zone exclusively. The scheme of sampling in the profiles of the lower part of the Ropianka Formation (Fig. 2) makes it impossible to univocally define a priori the age of the boundaries of the marls lithosomes investigated and by the same the age of the Rybnik Flysch. Admitting the correctness of determination of the diagnostic taxa found in the very modest nannoplankton assemblages one cannot agree with the method of its interpretation by the authors. 
1. The ascertainment of taxa; Reinhardites anthophorus, Micula decussata, M. concavct in the top of the HSM complex does not settle the occurrence here of a whole CCI5 zone; the marls profile may reach merely the lower part of the zone since the location of the CC15/CC16 boundary is unknown. 
2. The ascertainment of taxon Aspidolitus parcus parcus, appearing in the CC 18 subzone (Early Campanian), in the bottom of the KMF complex (in both profiles -samples: D7 and W3) and apperance (in the Wiar profile - sample W1 directly under sample W3) of taxon Arkhangielskiella specillata, with FO in the upper part of the CCI7 zone (Early Campanian), makes it possible to assess the age of the marls bottom as Early Campanian, however, it does not settle the position of the Santonian-Campanian boundary within the Rybnik Flysch. 
3. On the basis of the appearance in the single sample (6 m below KFM) of taxa: Lucianorhabdus cayeuxii and of other Santonian- Campanian and as well as of Petrarhabdus copulatus one cannot arrive unhesitating at a conclusion about the Santonian age of this part of Rybnik Flysch (the authors themselves admit the presence of the earliest Campanian) nor about FO of the last taxon in the CC16 zone (Santonian). It is worthwhile to note that the authors have ignored the data published earlier (including the dating by nannoplankton - Gaździcka in: Kotlarczyk, 1988) which prove the Early Campanian age of the upper part of the Rybnik Flysch (cf. Fig. 3B). 
A correct interpretation of the data presented by the authors themselves leads (even within the faulty sampling) to defining the age of the Rybnik Flysch within the boundaries: upper part of CC15 zone - top of CC17 zone. This gives a two to threefold longer period of sedimentation of these beds than it is suggested by the authors.",,

Herbert'}]","Bedded pelagic limestones of early to mid Cretaceous age may record cyclic climate variability driven by changes in the Earth's orbit (""Milankovitch cycles""). If properly calibrated, the lithologic cycles could provide sedimentary chronometry at far shorter time scales than biostratigraphy and magnetic stratigraphy. The lower Cretaceous Maiolica Formation of northern and central Italy displays rhythmic bedding in sections whose magnetic reversal sequence is clearly correlated to the upper M-series marine anomalies. The magnetic reversals divide measured sections into 0.5-2 Myr increments in which sedimentation rate (assuming continuous deposition) can be measured to 15-25% accuracy. Paleomagnetically estimated sedimentation rates over a number of polarity zones establish, with one exception, a narrow range in periods of the carbonate cycles. Carbonate couplets have an estimated mean period of 23.5 kyr, and prominent modulations in bedding thickness (""bundling"") have a mean period of 117 kyr (Kent and Gradstein 1985 time scale). The close match of sedimentary periodicities to orbital repeat times implies that the carbonate cycles reflect a combination of precessional and eccentricity climatic forcing. Comparison of measured sections from different locations shows that bed-to-bed correlations are possible regionally, consistent with the Milankovitch hypothesis. Episodes of Barremian ""black shale"" deposition occur in the troughs of the short eccentricity cycle, as roughly one half of the carbonate-marl couplet, or about 10 kyr duration. It is possible to estimate both the timing (relative to the top of reversed chron M-0) and duration of a period of unusual organic carbon-rich deposition (""Selli Horizon"") in the early part of the Cretaceous Long Normal Magnetic Polarity Interval by tracing the sedimentary cycles up from the Barremian strata.",,

The Ottnangian lake is characterized by the alternation of silts deposited from suspension and sands representing sedimentation from turbidity currents, debris flows or grain flows. These facies continue into the Karpatian, although the depositional environment becomes marine. At the transition into the Early Badenian, the environment shallows, and is represented by high energy siliciclastic shoreface and stacked Gilbert-type fan deltas. The succession is terminated with marls deposited in an offshore environment, with intercalated biocalcarenites from turbidity currents. The marine sediments are subdivided into two depositional sequences separated by a correlative conformity of a type 2 unconformity. The first sequence consists of a transgressive systems tract which is represented by the Karpatian offshore sediments, and a highstand systems tract, which is represented by offshore sediments deposited close to the nearshore, shoreface and stacked Gilbert-type fan deltas of the Karpatian and the Lower Badenian age, showing rapid progradation. The second sequence consists of a shelf margin systems tract composed of aggrading shoreface sediments, and a transgressive systems tract composed of Lower Badenian offshore sediments.",,

There are five emergency exits in the section. Four emergency exits lead along a branch tunnel and a shaft into the open air and the one in the Lainzer Zoo leads directly to the open air as an adit. The two-track running tunnel and the crosscuts were driven from the shaft in Hofjagdstrasse next to the B1. Only absolutely essential works for the construction of the emergency exit shafts were carried out on the surface. The tunnel drive was through flysch rocks consisting of seasonal layers of marl, limestone and claystone and was excavated by hydraulic excavator loosened by blasting. In the sections under built-up areas, great emphasis was placed on the continuous monitoring of rock mass deformation and surface settlements. The continuous monitoring of vibration measurements and noise emissions caused by tunnelling was also of great importance and determined the sequence of work underground. After completion of the tunnelling work, the concrete works were carried out using two mobile steel formwork units. The internal works to the emergency shafts were carried out in parallel, so that the contract section can be handed over for the subsequent equipment and track works from the middle of 2010.

ΛΕΚΚΑΣ'}, {'name': 'Σ. Γ. ΛΟΖΙΟΣ'}, {'name': 'Γ. Δ. ΔΑΝΑΜΟΣ'}]","The September 7,1999 earthquake sequence hit the northwestern part of the basin of Athens (area between Aigaleo and Parnis Mt.), causing a large number of deaths and injuries, as well as extensive damage to structures. The major area represents a small basin which is covered by thick post-alpine formations, which are extended talus cones and, to a lesser extent, neogene lacustrine and fluvial deposits. The latter have been blanketed by the talus and the alluvial deposits at the north of the area. The basin is flanked by a hill range, where the non-metamorphic alpine carbonates of the ""Sub-Pelagonian"" Unit and an allocthonous tectonic melange that belongs to the ""Athenian nappe"" outcrop. The talus cones, with a thickness that ranges from a few m. to 100 m., contain frequent lateral transitions alternations of cohesive or semi-cohesive scree and loose deposits -sand, pebbles, gravel, clay, etc. The alluvial deposits consist of clay, red soils and conglomerates is clay matrix and have a thickness between a few m. and 20-30 m. The rieogene deposits comprise relatively compacted phacies of marls, marly limestones, clays and conglomerates. The alpine formations of both the autochton and the allocthon consist largely of carbonate rocks (limestones and marbles) and, to a lesser extend, of clastic deposits (sandstones, shales, schists, and graywackes). The main tectonic feature in the area is the contact between the two alpine units, located at the eastern margin. Besides this tectonic discontinuity, numerous other faults were located, either at the basin flanks, or within the postalpine formations. All these faults determined by a large number of boreholes. They are neotectonic structures that belong to two sets, one with NNW-SSE strike and 60°-80° WSWward or ESE-ward dips, and a second one with ESE-WNW strike and 60°-80° northerly or southerly dips. In fact, these faults are directly related to the creation and evolution of the small neogene basin, which is now buried under the talus scree and the alluvial deposits. It is a complex structure, since it incorporates smaller-scale horsts and grabens. The whole picture is in good accordance with the one we get from the greater area. The damage is located within a broad, NNE-SSW trending zone that covers the central and eastern parts of the area. The correlation of this picture with the geological and structural data from the studied area showed that the most serious damage took place on loose foundation formations, which were either the unconsolidated members of the talus cones, or the alluvial deposits. However, this was not the only factor that affected the damage distribution, since the heaviest damage was located (i) along the trace of the tectonic contact between the two alpine units, (ii) at the areas with higher fault density, usually close to the basin margins, but also locally within the basin. These faults were not reactivated in the September earthquake, but ""channeled"" the seismic energy into specific zones, which also holds, at a larger scale, for the greater meizoseismal area. Hanging wall effects, effects of sedimentary basins, basin edge effects and focusing effects are also probably to have played a significant part, at the locations where the fault geometry and the basin structure performed as reflectors, magnifying the effects of shaking and thus maximizing the strong ground motion values. Besides, the fact that the heaviest damage is located at the central and eastern part of the basin, where the fault fabric is denser and the faults better expressed, is not accidental.",,

These carbonates were cyclically deposited in a shallow water environment, alternating with marls or marry limestones, and are characterized by extensive dolomitization and chertification (with associated glauconitization). The cyclic nature of sedimentation suggests that deposition was eustatically driven. The diagenetic history of the limestones proceeded through the following path: (1) marine cementation of allochems concomitant with formation of micrite envelopes; (2) micritization of peloids, ooids and skeletal grains; (3) neomorphism of formerly high Mg-calcite and aragonite grains to low Mg-calcite; (4) partial to complete dolomitization; (5) partial chertification of both calcite and dolomite; (6) glauconitization of chert; (7) fracturing during shallow burial; and (8) precipitation of late coarse calcite spar or mosaic and saddle (baroque) dolomite spar filling voids and fractures. Porosity is virtually nil in these rocks except for infrequent unfilled fractures, vugs and oomolds, due primarily to cementation and chertification. Biogenic grains are abundant in the limestones with Nummulites sp., Alveolinid and miliolid foraminifera and crinoid ossicles and other echinoderm fragments being most common. The tests of Nummulites sp. are commonly replaced by length-fast chalcedony fibers which are occasionally later replaced by glauconite. Spherulitic and zebraic chalcedony and, more rarely, megaquartz, occur as void-filling cements and fringing chalcedonic fibers frequently rim the tests of skeletal grains. All except the fringing chalcedonic fibers were subject to glauconitization. Prior to the chertification process is an extensive dolomitization period. Rhombic and sucrosic dolomite partially to completely replaced calcite at a relatively early diagenetic stage. Silicification caused the replacement of calcite by chert at a much more rapid rate than that of dolomite which was found ""floating"" within a chertified matrix. Fractures occurred both early and late in the Pus and are usually filled by a late coarse mosaic calcite spar (or coarse mosaic and saddle dolomite spar in completely dolomitized samples).",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/AA/79/1C/AA791C1FCD6C4A7D4E04FA18248CF38D.pdf

It consists of fine siliciclastics alternating with carbonates, mostly limestones, rare dolostones and marls. The nature of the siliciclastics indicates a cratonic source area (Europe), where intrusive and/or orthometamorphic rocks were being eroded. The formation differs lithologically from the underlying Norian Dolomia del Cristallo, represented by early-dolomitised inner platform facies, and the overlying Early Jurassic Monte Motto Formation which consists of cherry and marry limestones deposited in a pelagic setting. The upper and lower boundaries of the Fraele Formation are sharp. Foraminifer and palynomorph assemblages from the Fraele Formation indicate a Late Norian to Rhaetian age. The sedimentary facies and faunal associations of the Fraele Formation differ from those of the underlying Dolomia del Cristallo because of different paleoenvironmental evolution. The change in environmental parameters was controlled mainly by a climatic change to more humid conditions. This favoured on one hand the mobilisation and transport by rivers of siliciclastic material from the continent to the Tethys gulf, and on the other influenced the sea-water chemistry. Freshwater influxes lowered salinity and inhibited early dolomitisation. Input of low density freshwater resulted in the establishment of a permanent water mass stratification which influenced the benthic life. This paleoenvironmental reconstruction fits with the sudden elastic input which occurred in several palaeogeographic domains of the western Tethys realm (Austroalpine, Southalpine, Apennine, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia) during the Late Norian.",,

The Falconara/Gibliscemi section has been selected for an integrated approach at a high resolution scale using sedimentology, stable isotopes of the carbonates and microfossils. The sedimentary succession includes 46 precession-controlled cycles resulting from the periodical increase in biosiliceous productivity (diatomites) that followed the deposition of marls and pinkish laminites, which appear as sapropel-type deposits induced by the oceanic fertilization by terrestrial nutrients during wet periods. Higher scale environmental changes are superimposed to this precession forced rhythmicity. There is a general trend of increasing basin restriction from near marine conditions at the base of the Tripoli to semi-closed settings in its uppermost part, which are the prelude of the salinity crisis. This pattern reflects the hydrological response of the Mediterranean to the progressive decrease of the Atlantic inputs and an enhanced influence of the climate on depositional conditions. However, this evolution is not linear and shows successive phases of different duration. During the first period (until 6.71 Ma), open Atlantic–Mediterranean exchanges maintained relatively stable marine conditions. The second period (6.71–6.29 Ma), marks an important step in the basin restriction with a wider range of salinity fluctuations and an increased bottom stagnation. The 6.71-Ma event, which is correlated at a Mediterranean scale, may have resulted from shallowing of the Mediterranean gateway under a tectonic control. This shallowing reduced the oceanic inputs resulting in an increased climatic constraint of the Mediterranean hydrology. During the third period (6.29–6.03 Ma) an increase of the surface water salinity resulted in stressful conditions for the marine microfauna. The 6.29-Ma change is a major step in the restriction that may be correlated with the intensification of the glaciation recorded in the Atlantic, which could have enhanced the effects of the tectonic closure. The last two cycles (48 and 49), that underlie the ‘Calcare di Base’, witnessed the rapid transition to a semi-closed Mediterranean setting characterized by large variations of salinity from diluted to hypersaline conditions, under a dominant climatic control, and by the nearly complete disappearance of the marine organisms. Long-trend environmental changes recognized within the Tripoli Formation resulted from a complex set of interfering factors controlling the water fluxes exchanged between the Mediterranean and the world ocean. Most of the rapid changes identified in Falconara/Gibliscemi at 7.16, 6.71 and 6.29 Ma, that occurred simultaneously in the western and eastern Mediterranean, were mainly controlled by the stepwise tectonic closure of the Atlantic connections, although a glacio-eustatic overprint cannot be completely excluded.",,

This study examined relationships between field measurements and various standards, and compared the performance of nephelometry with transmissometry. Turbidity generated during a beach restoration project in Florida was compared with Formazin and marl standards. For each datum, paired readings were taken by nephelometry and transmissometry, and compared using regression analysis. Both instruments measured individual standards in proportion to their concentration over a broad range of turbidity. Turbidity in the field was optically heterogeneous, i.e., more variable than standards, and did not correspond to either instrument using Formazin calibration. Marl predicted turbidity in the field within 95% confidence limits only below 11 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). The State of Florida's statutory limit on turbidity of 29 NTU corresponds to 4.4 (+/- 1.2)% transmission (%T) using field turbidity data. The use of Formazin to calibrate these instruments at this level underestimated turbidity in the field by about 50% at 29 NTU; marl underestimated field turbidity by about 24%. Weight of silt/clay in the field was linear as a function of percent transmission (Fig. 2b), but not using nephelometric analysis. Marl weight as a nephelometric standard produced a linear response at all concentrations, in contrast to Formazin which failed to produce a consistent nephelometric response at concentrations below 25 mg . liter(-1). Turbidity produced by known weight of Formazin and marl did not correspond using either instrument, and considerably underestimated silt/clay concentrations in the field. Water quality standards are discussed with respect to these findings.",,

The resulting cladogram indicates that the genus divided into two distinct lineages soon after its appearance in the Late Albian. One group is known only from marly and sandy facies of Cenomanian age, while the second, more diverse, group appeared later in the Cenomanian but persisted into the Campanian.

This distinctive surface has been examined at three localities where it records evidence of complex sedimentologic and diagenetic histories. This surface is highly irregular and has been stained pervasively with limonite. The most conspicuous aspect of the uppermost Austin discontinuity surface is the abundance of phosphatized and pyritized nodules and bioclasts (gastropods, bivalves, corals, coprolites and Baculites sp.). Fish teeth and bone fragments are also present. These nodules and bioclasts have been penetrated by small-diameter chalk-filled borings. Close examination reveals the presence of abundant trace fossils, especially Rhizocorallium jenenese. These trace fossils have been infilled with reddish-brown clay piped downward from the overlying Ozan Marl. Phosphatic nodules and glauconite also occur in these clay-filled burrows. Well-preserved chalk-filled Rhizocorallium jenenese are present locally. The occurrence of Rhizocorallium sp. in the uppermost Austin Chalk is noteworthy because Rhizocorallium has not been recorded in other Cretaceous chalks of North America or Europe. The exquisite preservation of Rhizocorallium in the uppermost Austin Chalk is indicative of a firm ground paleosubstrate. Based on sedimentologic, mineralogic, and paleontologic data, the Austin Chalk-Taylor Marl contact is interpreted as a condensed horizon (omission surface). This phosphatized condensed horizon overlies the Rhizocorallium firm ground. This thin stratigraphic interval records a complex history of soft-sediment bioturbation, early marine lithification, submarine erosion, and mineralization. The amount of erosion along the Austin-Taylor contact in the study area appears to have been relatively minor. Elsewhere in north-central Texas the Austin-Taylor boundary has been subjected to significant erosion. The Austin-Taylor discontinuity surface formed in a relatively shallow marine (inner to mid-shelf) paleo-environment.",,

The data were calibrated to apparent reflectance using three techniques; the flat feld (rr) method, the empirical line (tt) method, and the internal average relative reflectance (u,nR) method. Results of these calibrations were evaluated by extracting image spectra and comparing them to librory'spectra for pure minerals and to laboratory spectra of samples collected from the field area. These comparisons show that each calibration method produces apparent reflectance spectra that contain useful mineralogical informotion. Care must be taken, however, to qvoid over interpretation, as oll of these calibrations may produce spectral artifacts. For this site, the IARR reflectance technique, which does not require a priori knodedge, was selected as providing the best results.

Comparison of the mineral maps with laboratory spectrul measurements of field samples and published geologic maps indicates that the cnn imaging spectrometer data are providing additional geologic detail. lntroduction The Geophysical Environmental Research (cER) aircraft scanner system was described in detail by Collins and Chang (1988; 1990). Basically, the instrument provides 63 spectral channels in the visible/near-infrared (vNn) and shortwave infrared (swn) regions with a spectral coverage of 0.433 to E.

This spectral coverage is obtained by using three detector arrays for the vNrR (0.433 to 0.971 pm), swnr (r.Og0 to r.aoo pm), and swn2 (1.986 to 2.495 pm) regions with a bandwidth of tz.q nm, 120 nm, and 16.2 nm, respectively. This instrument is, in effect, an imaging specbometer in that it provides highresolution, near-laboratory-quality reflectance spectra for each pixel of the image. cEn aircraft scanner data have been used successfully for a number of mineralogical applications since 1985 when the first results of a narrow-band scanner were reported by Collins and Chang (1985). In Australia, Mackin and Mqnday (t988) concluded that the instrument is capable of distinguishing between AI-OH, Mg-OH, and carbonate minerals and can be used effectively for remote mineral identification. Using cER data, Podwysocki and Jones (1988) mapped out distributions of kaolinite, alunite, and buddingtonite at Cuprite, Nevada. Kruse et o/. (1988; 1990), working in the same area, concluded that using imaging spectrometers such as GER allowed production of detailed maps for mineral exp. ti loration. They pointed out that, in addition to the minerals Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing, Vol. 60, No, 11, November 1994, pp. 1339-1354. 0099-11 2/94/601 1-1339$3.00/0 @ 1994 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing mapped by Podwysocki and fones (1988), hematite, goethite, and larosite could be mapped at Cuprite without prior knowledge of their locations. Werner and Lehmann (1991) concluded that soil surfaces with even small mineralogical variation could be differentiated using the shortwave infrared (swn) cER data. AII of these applications ernphasized the requirement for adequate calibration to reflectance of the raw cER data. This step is perceived as critical for deriving maximum information from such data (Vane et a1.,7s87). The GER instrument was flown over Makhtesh Ramon, Negev Israel during fuly 1989. Unfortunately, the flight was not followed by field reflectance measurements nor any ground sampling. Except for one recent study (Kauftnann ef o1., 1991), the data have not been analyzed, mostly because of calibration difficulties. Kaufrnann et al. (7997) have applied the flat ffeld (rr) and/or log residual (LR) calibration methods to part of the second flight line (from four taken) for the SwIR region only. Different cER spectra obtained for different lithological units were presented; however, no supporting spectral measurements were presented and detailed information about the calibration methods was not discussed. This study compiues three commonly used calibration methods (the flat field (pr) method, the empirical line (uL) method, and the internal average relative reflectance (nnn) method) for the cER data of Makhtesh Ramon. The study covers the full \ IIR-swtR (0.4to 2.5-pm) region and uses ground sampling for verification checks. The purpose of this study was to provide a baseline to help future workers achieve the most from this particular cER flight and to provide general information regarding the applicability of specific calibration methods to the GER data. Geology and Alteration Makhtesh (mortar in Hebrew) Ramon is located in southern Israel in the Negev area (Figure 1). Structurally, the area is an anticline with an eroded central valley, mostly drained by a single river (Nahal Ramon). The valley is bounded by steep walls with friable sandstones at the bottom and more resistant limestones and dolomites at the top (Ben-David and Mazor, 1988) (Figure 2). Makhtesh Ramon shows a continually exposed section from the Middle Triassic to the Middle Eocene. A good geologic summary (paraphrased below) is given by Kaufmann et al. (1.951.). fit40 The Triassic formations at Makhtesh Ramon consist primarily of sandstones and marine-littoral shales overlain by alternating limestones, dolomites, and argillaceous carbon: ates (""marl""). The Upper Triassic sediments are interpreted as lagoonal and are characterized by intercalated gypsum, dolomite, and clay capped by limestones. furassic sediments unconformably overlay the Triassic with development of fossil laterites consisting mainly of kaolinite and bauxite minerals prior to deposition of the furassic units. The Lower furassic Ardon formation was deposited in a shallow-water marine environment. The Early to Middle furassic Inmar formation consists primarily of sandstones and lacustrine clays and is overlain by sandstones, dolomite, and shales. A maior unconformity separates the marine sediments of the Middle Jurassic from the continental Nubian sandstones of the Early Cretaceous Hatira Formation. Upper Cretaceous limestones and dolomites contain glauconite and bentonite beds. Alkaline to hyper-alkaline laccoliths, sills, and dikes have been intruded into all units up to the Early Cretaceous. Hydrothermal alteration is often associated with these intrusions. Large sheet extrusions of alkaline basalts took place during the Early Cretaceous. There are limited exposures of Eocene limestones on the southern side of the makhtesh. Evolution of the present exposure of Makhtesh Ramon is the result of post-Eocene erosion and structural modification. Ben-David and Mazor (t9aa) present evidence for the formation of a pre-makhtesh peneplane during the Miocene caused by rivers flowing from south to north. They attribute excavation of the makhtesh by an eastward-flowing fluvial system to subsidence of the Arava Rift Valley accompanied by eastward tilting of the Nesev heishts includine the Ramon monocline, the pre g g g , r -malhtesh peneolane. and Hal l t pl , tira Formation sandstone exposures. Subsequent deepening of the Makhtesh resulted from gradual erosive incision, forming step-like alluvial terraces. Neotectonic movements along predominantly east-west dextral strike-slip structures are recorded in shifts of the course of Nahal Ramon. Wind-borne sediment from the loess province of the northwest Negev has been trapped at the makhtesh walls (especially the northwest walls) and stabilized by debris (Ben-David and Mazor, 1988). The area of Makhtesh Ramon is known as one of the most important mineralogical sites in Israel and is termed as a ""laboratory in nature"" (Ben-David and Mazor, 1988). The area has been declared a ""Reserve National Geology Park"" and consists of interesting mineralogical variation exposed in a small area. Because of the arid weather, only minor vegetation occurs within the Makhtesh. As a result, the area was selected to be covered by the GEn aircraft scanner in order to yield new, useful information regarding the lithology and mineralogy of the Makhtesh Ramon. The Calibration Methods Because the cER system responds to solar irradiation and atmospheric attenuation and scattering as well as Earth's surface reflectance, it is critical to remove unwanted components of the signals prior to analysis. The atmospheric/irradiation removal procedure (so called calibration) is an important step that must be taken prior to any spectral image analysis. This step requires great attention and care, and requires careful study for each image data set. This stage is doubly important for the cER scanner data because no onGI board calibration is available. Several methods to calibrate high resolution image data are in common use. Methods selected for this study and useful for unvegetated areas are discussed below: 2 3cRETAcEous o 5 r o r h 2 J U R A S S | C 1 TRTASSIC Figure 1.

The maximum depth of deposition is calculated from an equation based on eye morphology and efficiency and estimates of the vertical light attenuation. In this equation, K, the vertical light attenuation coefficient, is the most critical variable because it is the divisor for the rest of the equation. Rates of accumulation of coccoliths during the Cretaceous are estimated and are on the same order as those in modern areas of high phytoplankton production, suggesting similar pigment and coccolith concentrations in the water column. Values of K are known for a wide range of water masses and pigment concentrations, including areas of high phytoplankton production; thus light attenuation through the Cretaceous seas can be estimated reliably. Waters in which attenuation is due only to biogenic matter-conditions that result in deposition of relatively pure chalk-have values of K ranging between 0.2 and 0.3. Waters rich in phytoplankton and mud-conditions that result in deposition of marl-have K values as great as 0.5. Substituting these values for K results in a depth range of 65 to 90 m for deposition of chalk and a depth of 35 m for deposition of marl. These depth values suggest that deposition of many Cretaceous chalks and marls around the world were deposited under relatively shallow conditions.",,

The main purpose was to recognize palaeoenvironments and their changes in the Bakony Eocene Basin. Earlier research rather neglected this aspect. Palaeoecologic analyses of different groups of fossils (nannoplankton, foraminifera, molluscs, ostracods) and to a lesser extent, sedimentologic observations and field studies served as tools for the reconstruction of bathymetric conditions and subsidence history, by studying the trends in lateral facies changes. The reconstruction of palaeogeographic patterns was made possible. Vertical facies successions are clear, due to the excellent core material and the rather simple tectonic structure. Accurate datings have been possible, using the sophisticated stratigraphy worked out for the Bakony Eocene by a combination of magnetostratigraphic and planktonic zonations, published elsewhere. In part 1 the authors present the description and palaeoecologic analyses of the studied sections. The vertical succession of the main facies units in the SW Bakony Basin is as follows (bottom to top): coastal sandy pelites, pebbly sands, biogenic shelf limestone, glauconitic calcareous marl, hemipelagic globigerina marl with turbiditic sandstone intercalations. The same sequence in the NE Bakony Basin is as follows: alluvial-coastal sediments with coal seams, nummulitic shelly sands, glauconitic sands and marls, laminated clay, globigerina marl and bathyal clays.The authors discuss palaeoenvironments and their evolution in part II: The coastal facies in the SW Bakony Basin is a few million years older than in the NE. Nevertheless, this facies indicates in both areas flat coastal plains and seashores probably covered by mangrove.A carbonate shelf developed in the SW Bakony Basin with very low sedimentation and subsidence rates. The shelf period was much shorter in the NE. The shelves were influenced by intense currents that were active in the whole basin.Since Mid Bartonian times, retrogradation of the shelves is demonstrated by the sequence. First, sediments of shelf break and upper basin-slope environment overlie the shallow marine deposits. Strong glauconitization indicates current activity. The glauconitic facies is overlain by a globigerina marl and silts, described earlier as shelf sediments!The authors set out to prove that the maximum depth of its deposition has been at least 800 m. Turbidites are intercalating with the globigerina marl in the SW.In part III mainly palaeogeographic conclusions are discussed. The authors recognized on the basis of lateral facies changes that shallow marine conditions prevailed to the east and south of the Bakony Basin during the entire Bartoniah Priabonian. The position of erosional source areas and the direction of dense turbidity currents suggest the same conditions. The correlation with the Late Eocene-Early Oligocene Zala-Velence andesitic are is also discussed in some detail and is based on tephra layers, found in the globigerina marl. The authors recognized a remarkable, Middle Bartonian coincidence of several different events, such as increasing andesitic volcanism, sudden acceleration of basin subsidence, increase of sea depth, beginning of turbidity current activity. This may indicate a coeval increase in tectonism. The transgressions are younging towards the NE.The basin generation shows a similar shift. A complete palaeogeographic and probably a tectonic ""inversion "" took place in the Priabonian. The Southern Alpine-Dinaric character of the Eocene fauna and lithofacies changed gradually to an Eastern Alpine-Carpathian one during the Priabonian. From the beginning of the Oligocene, only the latter influence did exist. Also during the Priabonian, a new marine basin was formed in Hungary to the NE of the Bakony Hills.",,

Based on limited core samples available and on data gathered from an outcrop analogue north and south of the producing field, the sedimentary, early diagenetic and fracture-related characteristics of this dual porosity reservoir were studied and compared with the fold-and-thrust belt evolution context of the area. Additionally microthermometric analyses on aqueous and petroleum fluid inclusions have been integrated with kinematic and thermal 2D basin modelling to link the diagenetic history in the burial and thermal evolution of the reservoir and finally, to comment its implication on reservoir controlling parameters. The Eocene succession represents a shallowing upward sequence starting with open marine bioclastic medium-bedded limestones, which grades, into fabric destructive massive sucrosic and subsequently fine-crystalline dolomites. The presence of anhydrite nodules and chickenwire-shaped calcite pseudomorphs after anhydrite as well as the existence of dolomitised algal mats point towards restricted sedimentary conditions. The near surface sedimentation conditions are also reflected by the presence of flat channel conglomerate and breccia beds in the upper part of the dolomites. The breccia display features typical for early diagenetic evaporite collapse breccias. These dolomites, which are 15m thick, are overlain by a 32 m thick shale and marl succession in which few lacustrine limestone beds are intercalated. Subsequently a few meters of pedogenetically overprinted marine limestones develop below the regionally recognised Kulana sealing shales above which Fateh Jang conglomerates occurs. This is followed by shales and fine grained sandstones of the Murree Formation which unconformably overlies the Eocene strata. δ18O- and δ13C-values of the dolomite host rock vary between -0.5 to -6.3‰ and +1.2 and -4.5‰ respectively. These values are interpreted in terms of marine dolomites which were recrystallised by meteoric water infiltration. The marine limestones were also affected by this recrystallisation and possibly by additional interaction with hot fluids as testified by intensive neomorphism and their δ18O- and δ13C- values varying between -7.3 to -9.4‰ and -7.02 to -12.41‰, respectively. Especially the negative carbon isotope values point towards recrystallisation by soil-derived meteoric fluids. The late diagenesis is mainly characterised by (hydro)fracturation whereby at least seven distinct fracturation episodes were recognized. They are well-developed in the limestones just below the Kuldana shales. Noteworthy is that the carbonate reservoirs in the Potwar Basin are considered to produce mainly from fractures and from the Fateh Jang conglomerates and that the best reservoir producing level occurs just below the seal. The microtectonic analysis of the different fracture generations reflect the complex deformation history typical of ""fold-and-thrust belts"" (FFTB). The stable isotope signature and coeval fluid inclusions testify of an evolution from mixed marine and meteoric fluida, to burial rock buffered and overpressured fluids (90-170°C), which were episodically expelled below the Kuldana shales from deeper parts of the basin.",,

This Late Paleocene field has been problematic because of complex sand distribution and non-reservoir seismic anomalies. Two of the three most recent exploration wells failed to encounter reservoir sands. Our goal is to improve our ability to forecast reservoir sands in this and similar turbidite fields in the North Sea. First we recognize and classify different lithofacies from well-log data, including sandstone, shale, marl, limestone and tuff. Since the Vp/Vs ratio together with impedance better discriminate lithology than does impedance alone, we conduct AVO analysis to predict seismic lithofacies from seismic data. We derive probability density functions (pdfs) for each of the facies in terms of zero offset reflectivity (R(0)) and AVO gradient (G). R(0) and G from inversion of real seismic data is used to predict the most likely facies distribution along selected seismic lines. Subsequently, we analyze and quantify the seismic scale depositional geometries in the area. Where reservoir sands have been identified from seismic interpretation, there is a good correlation between reservoir sand thickness and a thicker, better defined Late Paleocene seismic interval. We take advantage of this correlation and predict thickness of reservoir sands given the Late Paleocene interval thickness. These results are integrated with the sand predictions from the AVO inversion. A blind test is conducted on a well drilled at a location where post-stack seismic amplitudes indicated reservoir sands, but where only shales, tuffs and some carbonates were encountered. Our lithofacies prediction results indicate that the most likely facies at that well location in terms of AVO response is tuff, whereas the geometry analysis indicate only local presence of a thin sand unit around the well. We conclude that the seismic anomaly around the well is caused by an intra-Late Paleocene tuff unit, and this unit likely explains the local thickening of the Late Paleocene interval .",,

The mudstones and shales are in great thick and distributed widely in the western Qaidam basin. In general sense, an effective source rock is ref erred to the rock with enough TOC， which expels oil when its generating oil is over a saturation in the porosity of the rock at proper buried depths or subsurf ace temperatures. If a rock with very low TOC, its generating oil could not be over the saturation for oil to be expelled out, the rock was called as ineffective source rock. Most samples analyzed by previous studies belong to the ineffec tive source rocks as their original TOC too low. Therefore, how to identify the effective source rocks is one of key aspects in petroleum resource assess ment on the Tertiary of the Qaidam basin.
　　By sedimentology study on the potential source rocks (dark colored mudstones and shales in the evaporate facies), the authors of this article discovered that th ere were significantly vertical changes in lithologies and TOC contents in the m udstones and shales, even in a single rhythmic layer of the rocks. The thi ckness of one rhythmic layer was mostly less than 1 or 2 meters. The rhythmic layer generally consists of marl, calcareous mudstone or shale, gyps shale, saliferous shale, gypsum and halite from the bottom to the top. The gray colored marls and calcareous shales took a large part of the thickness in the rhythmic layer, but their TOC contents were generally less than 0.4%. The dark gray and black co lored shales, gyps shales, and saliferous shales were in small thickness (about 10～50 cm) in one rhythmic layer, but rich in TOC (mostly over 0.8%, some of the m over 1%, even over 2%). However, identifying the effective source rocks in such different lithologies becomes a key task in hydrocarbon resource assessment with in the evaporate sequence. The authors designed a high pressured thermal simu lation and combination with the Rock-Eva pyrolysis on the samples with different TOC contents and different lithologies, and found that the original TOC content s of the effective source rocks were at least over 0.4%. The simulation and result were described in detail in this paper.This paper investigated the effective source rocks mainly on hydrocarbon generating from kerogen and expelling from t he shales, but not on immature oil generating and expelling. Therefore, the effective source rocks postulated in this paper do not include the immature effecti ve source rocks. The simulations conducted by the authors were ended correspond ing to 0.9%～1.0% of the Ro, I.e. At about the peak generation of oil from kerog en. If no oil was expelled from the rock sample at the peak oil generation from kerogen, the rock was known as ineffective oil source rock. But with increase of the thermal maturation, gas could be generated and expelled from the rock sam ple so that the rock might be called as effective gas source rock. However, the maturity of the Tertiary potential source rocks was not very high, the correspo nding Ro is generally less than 1%, and little gas was generated from the source rocks. Therefore, 0.4% of TOC is an useful standard for identifying the effective source rocks in the evaporate sequence, and a helpful index to finding the oil and gas in the Tertiary of the Western Qaidam basin. Though the effect ive source rocks defined in this paper are much thinner and less volume than those described in previous studies, much more oil may expel from the effective sou rce rocks because of their high potential of oil generation than those of bulk volume of the marls and calcareous shales.",柴达木盆地西部第三系发现了储量可观的油气资源，但是总体上讲这里的生油层钙质含量高、有机质丰度低；如何识别有效生油岩，正确评价油气资源潜量，成为这里油气勘探和地球化学的首要问题。通过上、下干柴沟组生油岩的沉积特征和地球化学分析，可发现盐湖相存在许多有机质丰度较高的生油岩；利用热解和模拟实验等方法确定出有效生油岩的有机碳含量下限为0.4%。这样既为该区生油岩提供了评价标准，又找到大量有效生油岩，解决了研究区油气资源预测的基本问题。,

Stratigraphic analysis is based on systematic variations in abundances of particular coccolith species and pelagic sediment types, referenced to the oxygen isotope time-scale. During the last 73 000 years deposition in the channel has included volcaniclastic sand/silt turbidites and minor marl turbidites as well as pelagic sediments. The interchannel area has fewer turbidites, and the sands present were probably deposited from turbidity currents which split over the channel sides. The last 'event' to give rise to sands in the channel and interchannel area occurred about 45 000 years ago. Although the channel has been inactive as an area of turbidity current deposition for the last 20 000 years, sands were deposited elsewhere on the lower rise, indicating that turbidity current transport routes have varied in time. Turbidity current deposition on the abyssal plain and low-lying continental rise appears to be related to distinct sliding events involving transport of material from various sources. Thin marl turbidites are interbedded with pelagic sediments in the area of sediment drape. There is a strong correlation between these and the thick marl turbidites on the abyssal plain, suggesting that the same turbidity current 'events', occurring about once every 25 000 years, gave rise to both sets of deposits. The thinner units probably represent deposition from the outer parts or tails of the large turbidity flows. The turbidites occur at glacial/interglacial transitions, suggesting that the slides that created them were triggered by mechanisms related to climatic change. Several volcaniclastic sand/silt units within the channel and in interchannel areas occupy mid-stage stratigraphic positions, perhaps indicating a different triggering mechanism for slides around volcanic islands. A debris flow deposit (debrite), between 30-degrees-N, 21-degrees-W and 31-degrees-N, 24-degrees-W, is related to the Saharan Sediment Slide, a major mass movement feature on the continental slope over 1000 km to the southeast.

The site was selected in 1985 for a survey of its arthropod fauna. A transect of the site from marl pools through fen, edge effect, and treed swamp was sampled for arthropods using pan and Malaise traps. Specialized microhabitats outside the transect were identified and sampled using pan traps. The Wagner fen samples contain 2181 species of arthropods contributing to a total known biota of 2905 species in the peatland. Of those, 1410 are Hymenoptera. Although seven other peatland studies are known, the inability of systematists to name most species prevents direct comparisons among peatlands. Data obtained from the Hymenoptera collections at Wagner demonstrate a progression in species richness as one approaches the forest-fen edge from either fen or forest. A large proportion [30% (382 species)] of Hymenoptera species, termed the aerial component, is active both in the forest-fen edge and in the fen. The aerial component is a highly mobile, at least locally transient, but often uncollected component of peatland ecosystems. Presence of the aerial component is probably associated with habitat structure. Those peatlands possessing more complex vegetation architecture have greater proportions of aerial species. About 80% of Hymenoptera at Wagner are parasitoids, most of which attack larva of holometabolous hosts. Based on the host groups sought by parasitoids and the ratio of parasitoid species per host species, the fen is estimated to contain about 6000 species of arthropods.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/CD/3A/91/CD3A9147053917585B1D3AABBF12D704.pdf
621947f15aee126c0fe4d41b,Climate Inferred from Geology and Archaeology,,"[{'name': 'K. O. Emery'}, {'name': 'David Neev'}]","Early climatic interpretations for the Lisan and later formations (Late Pleistocene and Holocene—Neev and Emery, 1967, figs. 16, 17) were supported and updated by information from additional coreholes. Although most new and old coreholes bottomed at relatively shallow depths, 20 to 30 m, four of them reached greater depths, 74, 80, 161, and 285 m beneath the 1960 floor of the Dead Sea south basin. The sequences consist of alternating layers of marl and rocksalt. Most marls were deposited from dilute brine during high lake levels and contain alternating laminae of chemical deposits of white aragonite, gray gypsum, and fine-grained detritus consisting of yellowish, brown, green, or dark gray carbonates, quartz, and clay. The detrital fraction is coarser and more dominant toward the deltas, especially near Amazyahu escarpment in the south. Rocksalt layers indicate deposition from more concentrated brine when the levels dropped to about -400 m m.s.l. Lower elevations could have been reached when the sea continued to shrink and when the runoff-to-evaporation ratio diminished, bringing the south basin to complete dessication. As neither the geochemical nature (ionic ratios) of the brines nor the physiography of the terminal water body has changed at least since Late Pleistocene or Lisan Lake time (Katz, Kolodny, and Nissenbaum, 1977), it is probable that through the past 60,000 years rocksalt was precipitated only when the water surface was at or below the critical level of -400 m m.s.l. Gamma-ray logs for some of the new coreholes provide more objective and precise depths of marl and rocksalt layers than do actual samples of sediments. Content of radiogenic minerals in the rocksalt is negligible compared with that in the marl; thus, these layers identify changing physical environments and climates as well as correlating stratigraphy. On gamma-ray logs the peaks or highest intensities of positive anomalies indicate that marl layers or wet climatic subphases and their thicknesses on the logs are proportional to their duration. Presence of negative anomalies or very low levels of gamma radiation show both the existence and thickness of rocksalt layers that denote dry climatic phases.",,

Detailed biostratigraphic data based on ammonites and dinoflagellates provide a time frame for a sedimentologic analysis. The carbonate series of the Celtic realm is composed of three shallowing-upward successions, each capped by a hardground. In the basinal domain east of the Aare River, marls persist in a monotonous facies throughout the same lime period. The first shallowing-upward succession within the Hauptogenstein Formation, started during the Blagdeni Subzone with marry beds and intercalated tempestites (Rothenfluh Beds), covered in the western Jura by fine-grained, bioclastic tempestites (Grenchenberg Beds). Simultaneously, the Gislifluh Reef developed in the southeastern Jura, probably on a morphologic high. Oolitic sedimentation started in the central Jura during the Niortense/Subfurcatum Zone (Lower Oolitic Series). The units of 0.5-2 m thick, cross-bedded oolites are attributed to a tidal, shallow-marine, high-energy setting. At the same time, the oolitic beds in the eastern Jura contain up to 35% of mud, and a low-energy setting is inferred (Lower Acuminata Beds). During the Garantiana Zone oolite-belts prograded eastwards reaching the area of the Aare River. An up to 70 m thick oolitic succession was deposited during a period of moderate sea-level rise and a steady subsidence. The second shallowing-upward succession started in the early Parkinsoni Zone. The production of ooids ceased during a sea-level highstand and marls and bioclastic limestones accumulated in northern Switzerland: the Homomya Marls in the western and the Upper Acuminata Beds in the central and eastern Jura. Later, a drop in relative sea-level during the late Parkinsoni Zone re-established ooid production (Upper Oolitic Series). The third shallowing-upward succession started during the latest Bajocian and earliest Bathonian (Zigzag Zone). Marry sediments rich in coarse bioclasts (Movelier Beds) are again interpreted as formed during a relative sea-level highstand. They are overlain by micritic oncolites in the western Jura; to the east, sparry bioclastic, locally cross-bedded limestones occur (""Spatkalk""), probably deposited by storms and tides. The deposition of the ""Spatkalk"" lasted until early Middle Bathonian, prograding eastward and covering the top of the basinal KLingnau Formation. The facies belts within the Hauptrogenstein and Klingnau Formations suggest the evolution of a middle Jurassic, north-south trending oolitic barrier dominated by tides. Backbarrier facies belts formed to the west and off-barrier assemblages to the east of this barrier. A decrease in the production of sediments, as evidenced by platformwide facies changes and in the thickness of shallowing-upward successions, was probably caused by changes in water circulation and local climate. On the other hand, more or less abrupt lateral changes in thickness and facies within the successions suggest local and regional patterns of differential subsidence.",,

Some random scatter appears after treatment at higher temperatures, due to the low remaining intensities and promoted by the acquisition of viscous magnetizations. Since these problems hamper a uniform analysis of the demagnetization results, a method is proposed to improve their representation and interpretation. A (simple) stacking routine reduces the amount of scatter considerably and makes it possible to separate different NRM components in a more consistent and reliable manner. In addition, the construction of NRM-decay curves is more straightforward from stacked diagrams and thus a more accurate information is obtained about the remanence carrying minerals. The application to two sites from southern Italy serves as an illustration for the method.",,

Two nested sampling networks consisting of grids with 50 m and 10 m edge lengths were erected. Soil samples were taken from the litter layer, the A(h) horizon and the B-v horizon in order to analyze the contents of C, N, available fractions of P, Ca, Mg, K and Na, the pH-value, and the soil texture. The vegetation components were investigated including the presence and coverage of species from the shrub and ground cover layer. As a result there could be determined different naturally induced and anthropogenically induced effects with characteristic spatial properties: texture distribution, litterfall radius, root-plant interaction in the trunk, tree and clearing areas, forest track marling, fertilizer dusts and ammonia inputs. As a consequence the beech forest can be devided in different zones, each characterized by the predominance of one or some of this effects. An unexpected high influence on spatial heterogeneity is caused by the fact, that marling was used for the central forest track. In a period of 100 years calcium has been distributed over a distance of about 100 m by a self-organized sequence carried out by the trees and intensified by improvement of growth conditions for the ground vegetation. As a positive feedback, seepage amounts and nutrient losses decrease in relation to other sites, the acidification progress runs slower.",,

Carbonate rocks are exploited for cement, while powdery tufa limestone is mined in Bonito for agricultural use. Clay, another important mineral resource in the state, used solely for ceramics, is concentrated in the Rio Verde de Mato Grosso-Coxim and Bela Vista-Jardim regions. Dimension stones are restricted to marls in Bonito and granites around Porto Murtinho. There are problems with building materiais such as sand and gravei, because of their poor quality. Exploitation of the sands also causes environrnental problems, especially in rivers near the cities. Small-scale diamond mining by rudimentary processes leads to similar environrnental problems in the Aquidauana and Coxim regions. Phosphatic rocks occur in the Corumba Group in the eastern Bodoquena Plateau. The Botucatu Formation, west ofthe Campo Grande, the state capital, presents good potential for sand, mainly for industrial purposes. Detailed geologic studies are required, however, for better economic evaluation of these deposits. The exploitation of industrial minerais in Mato Grosso do Sul State is still not intensive. Nevertheless, new economic perspectives together with the improving transportation system to the neighboring State of Sao Paulo, mainly through Tiete-Parana riverway, favour future economic growth. Thus, it is imperative that urgent planning measures be taken in arder to reduce negative environmental impact.",,

We quantified the effects of such management at Bluff Spring Pen Nature Preserve (Cook County, Illinois, USA), where eight dormant-season prescription burns supplemented by shrub cutting took place from 1982 to 1992. Baseline transects established across the fen in 1986-87 were resampled in 1992 in relatively undisturbed spring run/marl flat, calcareous seep, graminoid fen, and sedge meadow communities, and in disturbed graminoid fen vegetation where woody plant invasion and species change had occurred after previous grazing and fire suppression. Analyses of plot richness or diversity found no significant temporal changes. Correlation coefficients and indices of floristic similarity and coefficients of conservatism were sensitive to significant vegetation changes in sedge meadow and in disturbed fen habitats, but no: in less-disturbed vegetation. More rigorous analyses found significant temporal changes throughout the fen, which paralleled known fire effects on grassland. In most relatively undisturbed communities, combined frequencies of graminoid species increased, forb frequencies decreased, and woody vegetation remained unchanged. At the species level, this pattern was supported by significant increases in cover of most dominant grasses and sedges. The decline in overall forb frequency was cumulative, as few individual forb species declined in cover or frequency. One exception was the common fen goldenrod Solidago ohioensis, which decreased in cover but not frequency in two communities. Disturbed fen underwent structural and successional changes that varied with habitat. Gray dogwood (Cornus racemosa), the most aggressive invader of disturbed fen, was more resistant to fire and cutting in unshaded fen and less resilient and more controllable in partial shade of bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa). The prairie grass Andropogon gerardii increased only in unshaded areas of disturbed fen. Successional changes in herbaceous species included loss of alien species and gain of prevalent fen species, although some species that appear to represent late-successional graminoid fen have not yet appeared in disturbed graminoid fen. More precise and frequent monitoring and experimental management treatments are needed to determine the relevance of these findings. Because Cornus racemosa is also present in higher quality graminoid fen and in calcareous seep, continued control of woody vegetation may be required; it is doubtful that dormant-season prescribed burning or cutting without application of appropriate herbicides can eliminate this resilient species.",,

A multifaceted study is being carried out on a series of relict fronts in turbidities of varied origin and composition, recovered from the Madeira abyssal plain on ODP Leg 157. A similar study is being made on an active front in the most recent, S1 sapropel, from the central Mediterranean. In both cases, the relatively organic-rich turbidities and sapropels are intercalated with typical, organic-poor pelagic marts. Analyses include major and minor inorganic elements, stable and N isotopes, palynomorphs, surface areas and a comprehensive suite of biochemicals. Although the extent of alteration varies, striking changes in organic content and composition occur across many of the oxidation fronts, and the oxidized horizons resemble the interclated marls. A common trend is that organic C contents drop from [open quotes]monolayer equivalent[close quotes] sorptive loadings in the unoxidized horizons (typical of continental mar inmore » sediments) to submonolayer loadings, typical of the pelagic marls. Shifts are also observed in redox-sensitive trace metals and in stable C and N isotopic compositions, although the patterns and extent are not uniform.

This study results in the first precise biostratigraphic zonation and paleoenvironmental evaluation of these Neogene units in the subsurface as well as a re-evaluation of the age and correlation of outcropping strata. The Jealousy Formation is an entirely subsurface unit of dark, plankton-rich marls which contains planktonic foraminifera indicative of the lower part of the middle Miocene (Praeorbulina glomerosa Zone to the Globorotalia fohsi fohsi Zone) and a middle bathyal benthic microfauna. The Kingshill Limestone conformably and diachronously overlies the Jealousy Formation and is subdivided into two members, both of which occur in outcrops and the subsurface. The lower of these, the La Reine Member, is characterized by buff pelagic limestones and marls with an upward increasing proportion of intercalated shelf-derived debris. It ranges from the basal part of the middle Miocene (Praeorbulina glomerosa Zone) to the upper part of the uppermost Miocene (Globorotalia humerosa Zone), and exhibits a transition from middle bathyal (600-800m) to upper bathyal (200-300m) environments. The uppermost part of the Kingshill Limestone, the Manning's Bay Member, is made up of skeletal debris-rich carbonate slope deposits and is placed near the Miocene-Pliocene boundary. Biostratigraphic control indicates activation of the St. Croix graben fault system and formation of the Kingshill basin at the beginning of the late Miocene. The Neogene section records deposition in an open-marine setting at middle bathyal depths during the early middle Miocene, shoaling gradually to upper bathyal depths in the late middle and late Miocene and more rapidly to a shallow-marine setting at the beginning of the Pliocene. Shoaling was accompanied by an increasing proportion of transported shallow marine sediments. Subsidence analysis for the section indicates more than 400 m of tectonic uplift between 10.5 and 3.5 Ma. Two depositional shifts in the Kingshill Limestone may be tied chronostratigraphically to postulated major global sea-level fails.

 Germany) are represented by the Rotpläner facies on swells (multicolored marls and marly limestones) and the basinal Black
 Shales facies (marly limestones (Turbidites), black shales) in the local basins. Facies units are described with their lateral
 and vertical variation from both depositional environments and their correlation is discussed. The distinct Cenomanian-Turonian
 boundary facies is due to dilution of pelagic carbonate by siliciclastic material, volcanic ashfall, and substantial changes
 in carbonate, sedimentation rates by about an order of magnitude. The observed sediment geometries origin from preservation
 of sediments in areas where normal faults occur and erosion of the formerly deposited units in unfaulted areas (preservation
 of relicts). Erosion and redeposition on swells occurs in thin (<50 cm thick) debris flow and mud flow channels (1–100 m wide),
 sheet flows, and by turbidity currents. During the Upper Cenomanian the sediment transport is governed by gravity flow which
 is increasingly superimposed by storm deposition during the Lower Turonian. Lense-shaped tempestites (probably below average
 storm wave base) occur at the base of the Turonian (entry ofMytiloides hattini) in morphologically highest swell positions and migrate across the entire basin until the late Lower Turonian. The basinal
 facies is characterised by laminated and biotrubated black shales and mud turbidites that vary over short distances. Laminae
 show graded bedding and erosive contacts and were deposited by turbidity currents. Intercalated marly limestones are mud turbidities
 (some mudflows) that are coarsening upwards until the early Lower Turonian. Larger slides occurred predominantly in the late
 Upper Cenomanian. The sediment distribution is closely related to sea level changes and reflects short- and long-term fluctuations
 generating comparable stratigraphic trend in the sections, although basin and swell facies are always clearly distinguished.
 Lokal basin margins (e.g. primary fordeeps of sal domes) were probably limited by larger normal faults that prevented facies
 gradation between both depositional environments.

Thirteen ichnotaxa were determined from Upper Cretaceous red deep-water marly deposits of the Pieniny Klippen Belt. Most of the ichnofossils occur in thin beds of fine-grained sandstone and mudstone, and the marls alternating with them, of the Macelowa Marl Member. Tubular forms of Planolites type are prevalent there, accompanied by Zoophycos which are restricted to the marls. Less commonly occurring ichnogenera are: Subphyllochorda, Scolicia, Taphrhelminthopsis, Spirophycus, Sabularia, Buthotrephis and Cylindrychmis. The low diversity assemblage is explained here by the little food storage in well oxygenated sediments and the soupy consistency of the sediment. Brick-red marls of the Pustelnia Marl Member are totally bioturbated and contain no identifiable trace fossils. This is a result of a very low rate of sedimentation, connected with the cohesionless nature of the sediment which decreased the potential for burrow preservation.",,

There are strong indications that the VGP paths result from smoothing of the non-antipodal stable directions before and after the transitions. The upper Thvera transitional record is preceded by two excursions and followed by a third one. The first excursion is a sedimentary artefact caused by post-depositional migration of magnetic minerals and the third one by is caused by weathering of the sediment. The upper Thvera transition from Sicily is compared with the record from Calabria, about 250 km away. The two records show similarities as well as differences: both transitions have identical VGP paths, but in Calabria the transition is recorded lower in the sediment, the first and third excursions have different characters and the second one is not present.

The EgoMap architecture incorporates several inductive biases including a differentiable inverse projection of CNN feature vectors onto a top-down spatially structured map. The map is updated with ego-motion measurements through a differentiable affine transform. We show this architecture outperforms both standard recurrent agents and state of the art agents with structured memory. We demonstrate that incorporating these inductive biases into an agent\u0027s architecture allows for stable training with reward alone, circumventing the expense of acquiring and labelling expert trajectories.

Methods: We investigated 111 consecutive patients with a sole diagnosis of migraine with or without aura presenting to the Headache Unit at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and 73 headache-free controls for the presence of RLS using a semistructured interview. In addition, we assessed the level of daytime sleepiness by means of the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). A second group of headache-free controls was screened for the presence of RLS using an online questionnaire. Results: The frequency of RLS in migraine patients was significantly higher than in controls (22% vs. 5% (p < 0.001) and 8% (p < 0.001)).

In a related observation, several conditions that can deplete iron stores have been linked to increased probability of RLS. Blood donation has been linked to iron deficiency. it has thus been hypothesized that donating blood may be a risk factor for developing RLS. Patients and methods: Two thousand and five UK blood donors, ranging from first-time donors to some who had donated more than 70 times, completed the validated Cambridge-Hopkins RLS questionnaire (CH-RLSq) following their donation session. The questionnaire included a set of questions designed to diagnose RLS. The donors' histories of blood donations were determined both from self-report and from the National Blood Service database. Results: A number of statistical models were constructed to determine whether the probability of RLS diagnosis was related to the history of blood donations. Controlling for age and sex, no evidence was found to suggest that a greater number or frequency of blood donations increased the risk of RLS. Even amongst sub-groups especially vulnerable to iron depletion through blood donation, such as vegetarians or low weight individuals, no evidence for an increased risk of RLS could be found. Conclusions: We found no evidence that the frequency or number of blood donations up to the UK maximum of three times a year would increase the risk of RLS. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we present an OWL 2 RL inference engine implemented inside the Oracle database system, using novel techniques for parallel processing that can readily scale on multicore machines and clusters. Additionally, we have added support for efficient incremental maintenance of the inferred graph after triple additions. Finally, to handle the increasing number of owl:sameAs relationships present in Semantic Web datasets, we have provided a hybrid in-memory/disk based approach to efficiently compute compact equivalence closures. We have done extensive testing to evaluate these new techniques; the test results demonstrate that our inference engine is capable of performing efficient inference over ontologies with billions of triples using a modest hardware configuration.",,

Humans use this ability to quickly solve a task instance, and to bootstrap learning of new tasks. Achieving these abilities in autonomous agents is an open problem. In this paper, we introduce an off-policy RL algorithm (MetaMimic) to narrow this gap. MetaMimic can learn both (i) policies for high-fidelity one-shot imitation of diverse novel skills, and (ii) policies that enable the agent to solve tasks more efficiently than the demonstrators. MetaMimic relies on the principle of storing all experiences in a memory and replaying these to learn massive deep neural network policies by off-policy RL. This paper introduces, to the best of our knowledge, the largest existing neural networks for deep RL and shows that larger networks with normalization are needed to achieve one-shot high-fidelity imitation on a challenging manipulation task. The results also show that both types of policy can be learned from vision, in spite of the task rewards being sparse, and without access to demonstrator actions.",,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/1324/442/1326/5bdc31c217c44a1f58a0ca7f_0.pdf

Comparison with the conventional recursive least square (RLS) and least mean square (LMS) algorithms shows that the proposed RRLS algorithm can identify the modes from the combined ringdown and ambient signals with outliers and missing data in real-time without noticeable performance degradation.

Many promising approaches to this challenge consider RL as a process of training two functions simultaneously: a complex nonlinear encoder that maps high-dimensional observations to a latent representation space, and a simple linear policy over this space. We posit that a superior encoder for zero-shot generalization in RL can be trained by using solely an auxiliary SSL objective if the training process encourages the encoder to map behaviorally similar observations to similar representations, as reward-based signal can cause overfitting in the encoder (Raileanu et al., 2021). We propose Cross-Trajectory Representation Learning (CTRL), a method that runs within an RL agent and conditions its encoder to recognize behavioral similarity in observations by applying a novel SSL objective to pairs of trajectories from the agent's policies. CTRL can be viewed as having the same effect as inducing a pseudo-bisimulation metric but, crucially, avoids the use of rewards and associated overfitting risks. Our experiments ablate various components of CTRL and demonstrate that in combination with PPO it achieves better generalization performance on the challenging Procgen benchmark suite (Cobbe et al., 2020).

Besides the propagation environment that determines the channel bit error rate, packet payload size has a significant effect on the packet loss rate. In this paper, we first discuss the effect of packet size on the packet reception ratio, and then propose a broadcast protocol that is able to specify the best relay node by taking into account the data payload size. The proposed protocol employs a fuzzy logic-based algorithm to jointly consider multiple metrics (link quality, inter-vehicle distance, and vehicle mobility) and uses a redundancy transmission approach to ensure high reliability. Since the fuzzy membership functions are tuned by using reinforcement learning, the protocol can adapt to various network scenarios. We use both real-world experiments and computer simulations to evaluate the proposed protocol.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/5C/7B/87/5C7B87C163BC142B01E7C5DDE981C47B.pdf

However, finding the optimal adversary is challenging, in terms of both whether we can find the optimal attack and how efficiently we can find it. Existing works on adversarial RL either use heuristics-based methods that may not find the strongest adversary, or directly train an RL-based adversary by treating the agent as a part of the environment, which can find the optimal adversary but may become intractable in a large state space. In this paper, we propose a novel attacking algorithm which has an RL-based ""director"" searching for the optimal policy perturbation, and an ""actor"" crafting state perturbations following the directions from the director (i.e. the actor executes targeted attacks). Our proposed algorithm, PA-AD, is theoretically optimal against an RL agent and significantly improves the efficiency compared with prior RL-based works in environments with large or pixel state spaces. Empirical results show that our proposed PA-AD universally outperforms state-of-the-art attacking methods in a wide range of environments. Our method can be easily applied to any RL algorithms to evaluate and improve their robustness. ",,

In parallel to improving DRL algorithms themselves, Automatic Curriculum Learning (ACL) study how teacher algorithms can train DRL agents more efficiently by adapting task selection to their evolving abilities. While multiple standard benchmarks exist to compare DRL agents, there is currently no such thing for ACL algorithms. Thus, comparing existing approaches is difficult, as too many experimental parameters differ from paper to paper. In this work, we identify several key challenges faced by ACL algorithms. Based on these, we present TeachMyAgent (TA), a benchmark of current ACL algorithms leveraging procedural task generation. It includes 1) challenge-specific unit-tests using variants of a procedural Box2D bipedal walker environment, and 2) a new procedural Parkour environment combining most ACL challenges, making it ideal for global performance assessment. We then use TeachMyAgent to conduct a comparative study of representative existing approaches, showcasing the competitiveness of some ACL algorithms that do not use expert knowledge. We also show that the Parkour environment remains an open problem.

The most common way to approach this challenge is to employ pessimistic or conservative methods, which avoid behaviors that are too dissimilar from those in the training dataset. However, relying exclusively on conservatism has drawbacks: performance is sensitive to the exact degree of conservatism, and conservative objectives can recover highly suboptimal policies. In this work, we propose that offline RL methods should instead be adaptive in the presence of uncertainty. We show that acting optimally in offline RL in a Bayesian sense involves solving an implicit POMDP. As a result, optimal policies for offline RL must be adaptive, depending not just on the current state but rather all the transitions seen so far during evaluation. We present a model-free algorithm for approximating this optimal adaptive policy, and demonstrate the efficacy of learning such adaptive policies in offline RL benchmarks.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/35/A6/23/35A623ABAADF3EB9F3F173FA8CBAF068.pdf

However, how these algorithms are used is usually determined by heuristics, and it does not always yield well optimizations on all circuits. To achieve well optimized results, engineers need to tune the sequence consisting of these logic optimization algorithms based on their knowledge. To overcome this limitation, in this brief, reinforcement learning (RL) proximal policy optimization (PPO) is proposed to train an agent to tune the optimization sequence. Specifically, graph isomorphic network with edge feature aggregation capability (GINE) is used to learn circuit representations and use circuit representations as state representations for the reinforcement learning agent. Furthermore, to enable the agent learning from historical operations, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is further embedded in reinforcement learning. The evaluation of the EPFL arithmetic benchmark shows that our model improves the area optimization under the delay constraint by 21.21% over existing methods.",,

We exploited these observations to identify the regulatory regions of the GS gene and the responsible signal-transduction pathway that mediates this effect.Fetal hepatocytes of wild-type or GS-transgenic mice were co-cultured with RL-ET-14 cells to induce GS expression. Small-interfering RNA was employed to silence beta-catenin expression in the fetal hepatocytes prior to co-culture.Co-cultivation of RL-ET-14 cells with fetal mouse hepatocytes induced GS expression 4.2-fold. The expression of another pericentral enzyme, ornithine aminotransferase and a periportal enzyme, carbamoylphosphate synthetase, were not affected. Co-culture of RL-ET-14 cells with transgenic fetal mouse hepatocytes demonstrated that GS expression was induced via its upstream enhancer located at -2.5 kb and that the signal mediator required a functional beta-catenin pathway.The 'RL-ET-14' factor specifically induces GS expression, working via its upstream enhancer in a beta-catenin-dependent fashion.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/F8/94/B2/F894B27D6859F2919858C6C7B3A657E2.pdf

Target translational model involves an object moving in a parabolic path using projectile physics. A state-space model is constructed incorporating kinematic states, and recursive techniques are used to estimate the state vector as a function of time. The measured data are the noisy image plane coordinates of object match taken from image in the sequence. Image plane noise levels are allowed and investigated. The target trajectory estimation is formulated as a tracking problem, which can use an arbitrary large number of images in a sequence and is done using Recursive Least Squares (RLS).

A new method for recursive estimation of the additive noise variance is also proposed for reliable bias compensation. The mean and mean-square asymptotic behaviors of the algorithm are analyzed and a self-calibration scheme is further proposed to improve the steady-state mean squares error (MSE) due to finite sample effect. Simulations show that the proposed VFF approach offers improved tracking and steady-state MSE performance over the conventional recursive least squares method and its fixed FF counterpart. A linear array architecture is proposed for the realization of this algorithm and several hardware efficient techniques are introduced to avoid the expensive cubic root and division operations required.

In domains like autonomous driving, recommendation systems, and more, optimal RL policies learned could cause a privacy breach if the policies memorize any part of the private reward. We study the set of existing differentially-private RL policies derived from various RL algorithms such as Value Iteration, Deep-Q Networks, and Vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization. We propose a new Privacy-Aware Inverse RL analysis framework (PRIL) that involves performing reward reconstruction as an adversarial attack on private policies that the agents may deploy. For this, we introduce the reward reconstruction attack, wherein we seek to reconstruct the original reward from a privacy-preserving policy using the Inverse RL algorithm. An adversary must do poorly at reconstructing the original reward function if the agent uses a tightly private policy. Using this framework, we empirically test the effectiveness of the privacy guarantee offered by the private algorithms on instances of the FrozenLake domain of varying complexities. Based on the analysis performed, we infer a gap between the current standard of privacy offered and the standard of privacy needed to protect reward functions in RL. We do so by quantifying the extent to which each private policy protects the reward function by measuring distances between the original and reconstructed rewards.",,https://static.aminer.cn/storage/pdf/arxiv/21/2112/2112.05495.pdf

Then, the LMD algorithm is used to decompose the pre-processed signal to obtain an effective PF component, and complete the envelope demodulation to extract information from the incipient fault. Based on the above algorithm, an improved RLS and LMD identifying algorithm for incipient faults can thus be achieved. Finally, some actual fault signals of a large unit rolling bearing are used to simulate and verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

However, such approaches can fail in the presence of temporally correlated noise in the observations, a phenomenon that is common in practice. We initiate the formal study of latent state discovery in the presence of such exogenous noise sources by proposing a new model, the Exogenous Block MDP (EX-BMDP), for rich observation RL. We start by establishing several negative results, by highlighting failure cases of prior representation learning based approaches. Then, we introduce the Predictive Path Elimination (PPE) algorithm, that learns a generalization of inverse dynamics and is provably sample and computationally efficient in EX-BMDPs when the endogenous state dynamics are near deterministic. The sample complexity of PPE depends polynomially on the size of the latent endogenous state space while not directly depending on the size of the observation space, nor the exogenous state space.

It is often difficult to compare the algorithmic results from one study to the next, because the conditions and robots used vary. With this in mind, we have used an open-source, 3D printed quadruped robot called QuadraTot, so the results may be verified, and hopefully improved upon, by any group so desiring.

Effectively balancing the performance of the generator and discriminator is critical, since a discriminator that achieves very high accuracy will produce relatively uninformative gradients.

By enforcing a constraint on the mutual information between the observations and the discriminatoru0027s internal representation, we can effectively modulate the discriminatoru0027s accuracy and maintain useful and informative gradients. We demonstrate that our proposed variational discriminator bottleneck (VDB) leads to significant improvements across three distinct application areas for adversarial learning algorithms. Our primary evaluation studies the applicability of the VDB to imitation learning of dynamic continuous control skills, such as running. We show that our method can learn such skills directly from emph{raw} video demonstrations, substantially outperforming prior adversarial imitation learning methods. The VDB can also be combined with adversarial inverse reinforcement learning to learn parsimonious reward functions that can be transferred and re-optimized in new settings.

Network congestion control has been dominated by hand-crafted heuristics for decades. Recently, ReinforcementLearning (RL) has emerged as an alternative to automatically optimize such control strategies. Research so far has primarily considered RL interfaces which block the sender while an agent considers its next action. This is largely an artifact of building on top of frameworks designed for RL in games (e.g. OpenAI Gym). However, this does not translate to real-world networking environments, where a network sender waiting on a policy without sending data is costly for throughput. We instead propose to formulate congestion control with an asynchronous RL agent that handles delayed actions. We present MVFST-RL, a scalable framework for congestion control in the QUIC transport protocol that leverages state-of-the-art in asynchronous RL training with off-policy correction.

Perhaps surprisingly, our main result shows that even if: i) we have realizability in that the true value function of \emph{every} policy is linear in a given set of features and 2) our off-policy data has good coverage over all features (under a strong spectral condition), then any algorithm still (information-theoretically) requires a number of offline samples that is exponential in the problem horizon in order to non-trivially estimate the value of \emph{any} given policy.

We evaluate the resulting method, cem-rl, on a set of benchmarks classically used in deep RL. We show that cem-rl benefits from several advantages over its competitors and offers a satisfactory trade-off between performance and sample efficiency.",,https://static.aminer.cn/storage/pdf/arxiv/18/1810/1810.01222.pdf

More precisely, we show that the learned representation captures the layout of the environment as well as the position and orientation of the agent. Our experiments show that the model substantially improves data-efficiency on a number of reinforcement learning (RL) tasks compared with strong model-free baseline agents. We find that predicting multiple steps into the future (overshooting), in combination with an expressive generative model, is critical for stable representations to emerge.

Here, we evaluate whether “winning ticket” initializations exist in two different domains: natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL).For NLP, we examined both recurrent LSTM models and large-scale Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017). For RL, we analyzed a number of discrete-action space tasks, including both classic control and pixel control. Consistent with workin supervised image classification, we confirm that winning ticket initializations generally outperform parameter-matched random initializations, even at extreme pruning rates for both NLP and RL.

A natural first approach toward safe RL is to manually specify constraints on the policy's behavior. However, just as learning has enabled progress in large-scale development of AI systems, learning safety specifications may also be necessary to ensure safety in messy open-world environments where manual safety specifications cannot scale. Akin to how humans learn incrementally starting in child-safe environments, we propose to learn how to be safe in one set of tasks and environments, and then use that learned intuition to constrain future behaviors when learning new, modified tasks. We empirically study this form of safety-constrained transfer learning in three challenging domains: simulated navigation, quadruped locomotion, and dexterous in-hand manipulation. In comparison to standard deep RL techniques and prior approaches to safe RL, we find that our method enables the learning of new tasks and in new environments with both substantially fewer safety incidents, such as falling or dropping an object, and faster, more stable learning. This suggests a path forward not only for safer RL systems, but also for more effective RL systems. ",,https://static.aminer.cn/storage/pdf/arxiv/20/2010/2010.14603.pdf

However, critical flow rerouting is not trivial because the solution space for critical flow selection is enormous.

In this paper, we propose CFR-RL (Critical Flow Rerouting-Reinforcement Learning), a Reinforcement Learning-based scheme that learns a policy to select critical flows for each given traffic matrix automatically. CFR-RL then reroutes these selected critical flows to balance link utilization of the network by formulating and solving a simple Linear Programming (LP) problem.

The sliding window mechanism requires fixed aspect ratios and limits the cropping region with arbitrary size. Moreover, the sliding window method usually produces tens of thousands of windows on the input image which is very time-consuming. Motivated by these challenges, we firstly formulate the aesthetic image cropping as a sequential decision-making process and propose a weakly supervised Aesthetics Aware Reinforcement Learning (A2-RL) framework to address this problem. Particularly, the proposed method develops an aesthetics aware reward function which especially benefits image cropping. Similar to human's decision making, we use a comprehensive state representation including both the current observation and the historical experience. We train the agent using the actor-critic architecture in an end to -end manner. The agent is evaluated on several popular unseen cropping datasets.

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods are appropriate for supporting the legitimacy of the public policies that supply public goods at the cost of individual interests. Among these policies, the inter-regional collaborative pandemic control is a prominent example, which has become much more important for an increasingly inter-connected world facing a global pandemic like COVID-19. Different patterns of collaborative strategies have been observed among different systems of regions, yet it lacks an analytical process to reason for the legitimacy of those strategies. In this paper, we use the inter-regional collaboration for pandemic control as an example to demonstrate the necessity of MARL in reasoning, and thereby legitimizing policies enforcing such inter-regional collaboration. Experimental results in an exemplary environment show that our MARL approach is able to demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of restrictions on individual liberty for collaborative supply of public goods. Different optimal policies are learned by our MARL agents under different collaboration levels, which change in an interpretable pattern of collaboration that helps to balance the losses suffered by regions of different types, and consequently promotes the overall welfare. Meanwhile, policies learned with higher collaboration levels yield higher global rewards, which illustrates the benefit of, and thus provides a novel justification for the legitimacy of, promoting inter-regional collaboration.

This review focuses on marl lake ecology and chemistry, their known responses to eutrophication, and also highlights questions that remain unanswered.In good condition, marl lakes support a diversity of macrophytes, especially Characeae and Potamogetonaceae, which can grow to considerable depth. High water transparency and low phosphorus and phytoplankton concentrations are facilitated by the coprecipitation of marl and phosphorus. Although large amounts of phosphorus can be thus removed, buffering against eutrophication, macrophyte communities can undergo significant change under rather low nutrient concentrations. Maximum colonisation depth declines and tolerant species replace sensitive species, with losses particularly among charophytes. Marl lakes are therefore ecologically highly sensitive.The effects of coprecipitation on long-term burial of phosphorus are contested. Several palaeolimnological studies have identified iron complexes as more important than calcite, as chemical conditions in the sediment may promote either calcite dissolution or calcite-bound phosphorus exchange, or possibly both. Some marl lakes have been shown to have phosphorus concentrations which, compared with other lake types, are higher than expected in winter and lower in summer. The phosphorus binding capacity of marl sediment has not to our knowledge been adequately researched.Marl precipitation may be inhibited by high phosphate or organic matter concentrations in the water, or when biological communities effecting precipitation (picoplankton, charophytes, epiphytes) are disturbed. Highly impacted marl lakes having low species diversity and lacking precipitation may be misidentified as eutrophic, high-alkalinity lakes. More studies addressing the interaction between external loading, phosphorus cycling and marl precipitation in relation to biological communities are required to assess to what extent marl lakes can buffer eutrophication, and what factors contribute to disturbed marl precipitation.",,

There have been a lot of comprehensive studies on the origin of organic-matter pores and their pore size distribution, but few studies on the scales of clay-related pores and their contributions to the total pore volume and surface area. In this paper, we conducted thin section and SEM observation, mercury intrusion, low pressure N2 adsorption and high-pressure CH4 adsorption experiments, to characterize the pore volume and surface area of Mg-clay-bearing samples. The result suggests that the pore volume of clay-related pores mainly derives from the Intra-aggregate pores of 5–100 nm pore size, while the absolute and relative contributions of Interlayer pores (smaller than 2 nm) and Intra-tactoid pores (2–5 nm) to the total pore volume are small. Based on TOC contents and inorganic mineral compositions, a multiple regression analysis was carried out on the contributions of organic-matter and clay-related pores to pore volume in the pore-diameter ranges of smaller than 2 nm, 2–5 nm, 5–100 nm and larger than 100 nm. Although the contribution of clay-related pores (including inter-aggregate pores, Intra-aggregate pores, Intra-tactoid pores, Interlayer pores) to the total pore volume is comparable to that of organic-matter pores, the latter still contributes most of the pore surface area and CH4 adsorption site. It can be interpreted by the fact that the specific surface area of the dominant Intra-aggregate pores is significantly smaller than that of organic-matter pores. The conclusion of this study can be applied for the analyses of storage and adsorption capacity in all gas shales containing both organic and clay minerals.",,

Here, we develop a multiproxy cyclostratigraphy from a 31.2-m-thick Upper Valanginian to lowermost Hauterivian section of the Bersek Marl Formation in Gerecse Mountains, Hungary, comprising alternating marlstone layers of varying clay and carbonate content. The bulk carbonate δ13C signal shows sustained, elevated values (up to 2.7‰) up to 19.2 m, followed by a decreasing trend upsection. Together with biostratigraphic data, this suggests that the lower part of the section was deposited during the plateau phase of the Late Valanginian Weissert Event. Spectral analyses of the multiproxy dataset, including magnetic susceptibility measurements and gamma-ray spectroscopy on the lower part of the section, led to the identification of precession, obliquity, and long and short eccentricity signals. A mean sedimentation rate of 14 m/Myr was calculated based on astronomical tuning.

The program consisted of pile driving analyzer testing during initial pile driving and restrikes, Statnamic tests, static axial compression load tests, and reciprocal lateral load tests. On the basis of the interpretation of the test data, some important findings were obtained: (1) the alluvial clays in Savannah can only provide very limited resistance; (2) the time-dependent pile capacity gain after pile driving (i.e., setup effect) was approximately proportional to the pile embedment length into the Marl formation; (3) the estimated equivalent static pile capacities from the Statnamic tests were comparable to those from the static axial load tests; (4) the Marl formation is a competent bearing stratum for piles; (5) the potential degradation of pile concrete stiffness caused by pile driving should be accounted for in pile capacity analysis; and (6) the piles exhibited stiffer response under the monotonic lateral loading condition than the cyclic lateral loading condition. Finally, predictions on both axial and lateral pile capacities, using the soil parameters derived from the instrumentation data and back-analysis of the pile load tests, were compared with the corresponding pile load test results. The comparisons demonstrate that in combination of the static-bearing capacity formulas and the LPILE program, the developed soil models can make reliable predictions on both the vertical and lateral behaviors of the PSC piles driven through the soft alluvial clays to end bearing in the Marl formation.",,

Fairness is critical in various situations, including emergency communications in resource-constrained underwater networks that balance load and energy among nodes to optimize network performance. Existing solutions for fair communications, on the other hand, frequently come at the expense of network capacity. This article focuses on the power-management strategy that jointly optimizes the reuse, fairness, and capacity of UWSNs while also proposing a new metric for fair spatial reuse in networks: the fair reuse index (FRI). We observe that the FRI for UWSNs is strongly reliant on the network density, channel conditions, and application requirements. As a result, UWSNs commonly exhibit load imbalance and struggle to meet required network lifetimes. Toward this end, we propose DMPM, a deep multiagent reinforcement learning-based power-management strategy for increasing the fair reuse of UWSNs. DMPM strives to maximize the network’s fair reuse while allowing for gentle network capacity decrease. In two representative communication scenarios, numerical results demonstrate that DMPM achieves a significantly better tradeoff between network capacity and fair reuse than baseline techniques. We also construct three reward functions for DMPM and discuss how different reward functions affect node behaviors. Delivery delays of different models are discussed. We hope that the work provided in this study will prove to be invaluable in the design and optimization of UWSNs.",,

While supervised learning methods can generalize effectively without explicitly accounting for epistemic uncertainty, we describe why appropriate uncertainty handling can actually be essential in RL. We show that generalization to unseen test conditions from a limited number of training conditions induces a kind of implicit partial observability, effectively turning even fully-observed MDPs into POMDPs. Informed by this observation, we recast the problem of generalization in RL as solving the induced partially observed Markov decision process, which we call the epistemic POMDP.

It is especially suitable for multi-agent RL (MARL), as it naturally decouples the learning and the planning phases, and avoids the non-stationarity problem when all agents are improving their policies simultaneously using samples. Though intuitive, easy-to-implement, and widely-used, the sample complexity of model-based MARL algorithms has not been fully investigated. In this paper, our goal is to address the fundamental question about its sample complexity. We study arguably the most basic MARL setting: two-player discounted zero-sum Markov games, given only access to a generative model. We show that model-based MARL achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde O(|S||A||B|(1-\gamma)^{-3}\epsilon^{-2})$ for finding the Nash equilibrium (NE) value up to some $\epsilon$ error, and the $\epsilon$-NE policies with a smooth planning oracle, where $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $S,A,B$ denote the state space, and the action spaces for the two agents. We further show that such a sample bound is minimax-optimal (up to logarithmic factors) if the algorithm is reward-agnostic, where the algorithm queries state transition samples without reward knowledge, by establishing a matching lower bound. This is in contrast to the usual reward-aware setting, with a $\tilde\Omega(|S|(|A|+|B|)(1-\gamma)^{-3}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound, where this model-based approach is near-optimal with only a gap on the $|A|,|B|$ dependence. Our results not only demonstrate the sample-efficiency of this basic model-based approach in MARL, but also elaborate on the fundamental tradeoff between its power (easily handling the more challenging reward-agnostic case) and limitation (less adaptive and suboptimal in $|A|,|B|$), particularly arises in the multi-agent context.

In the present paper improved calibration accuracy is attained by an extension of the local piezoelectric transducer displacement by two additional terms, representing the flexibility and inertia contributions from the residual vibration modes not directly addressed by the shunt damping. This results in an augmented dynamic model for the targeted resonant vibration mode, in which the residual contributions, represented by two correction factors, modify both the apparent transducer capacitance and the shunt circuit impedance. Explicit expressions for the correction of the shunt circuit inductance and resistance are presented in a form that is generally applicable to calibration formulae derived on the basis of an assumed single-mode structure, where modal interaction has been neglected. A design procedure is devised and subsequently verified by a numerical example, which demonstrates that effective mitigation can be obtained for an arbitrary vibration mode when the residual mode correction is included in the calibration of the RL shunt.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/54/9B/71/549B71DAE6D2DD4767B395B2E2A40A44.pdf

We show that the causal influence reward is related to maximizing the mutual information between agentsu0027 actions. We test the approach in challenging social dilemma environments, where it consistently leads to enhanced cooperation between agents and higher collective reward. Moreover, we find that rewarding influence can lead agents to develop emergent communication protocols. We therefore employ influence to train agents to use an explicit communication channel, and find that it leads to more effective communication and higher collective reward. Finally, we show that influence can be computed by equipping each agent with an internal model that predicts the actions of other agents. This allows the social influence reward to be computed without the use of a centralised controller, and as such represents a significantly more general and scalable inductive bias for MARL with independent agents.",,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/1649/1449/1288/5bdc31b817c44a1f58a0bfc8_1.pdf

However, there has been limited progress towards a practical and scalable RL solution for HVAC control. While one can train an RL agent in simulation, it is not cost-effective to create a model for each thermal zone or building. Likewise, existing RL agents generally take a long time to learn and are opaque to expert interrogation, making them unattractive for real-world deployment.

To tackle these challenges, we propose Gnu-RL: a novel approach that enables practical deployment of RL for HVAC control and requires no prior information other than historical data from existing HVAC controllers. To achieve this, Gnu-RL adopts a recently-developed Differentiable Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy, which encodes domain knowledge on planning and system dynamics, making it both sample-efficient and interpretable. Prior to any interaction with the environment, a Gnu-RL agent is pre-trained on historical data using imitation learning, which enables it to match the behavior of the existing controller. Once it is put in charge of controlling the environment, the agent continues to improve its policy end-to-end, using a policy gradient algorithm.

We evaluate Gnu-RL on both an EnergyPlus model and a real-world testbed. In both experiments, our agents were directly deployed in the environment after offline pre-training on expert demonstration. In the simulation experiment, our approach saved 6.6% energy compared to the best published RL result for the same environment, while maintaining a higher level of occupant comfort. Next, Gnu-RL was deployed to control the HVAC of a real-world conference room for a three-week period. Our results show that Gnu-RL saved 16.7% of cooling demand compared to the existing controller and tracked temperature set-point better.

These results suggest a deeper connection between MaxEnt RL, robust control, and POMDPs, and provide insight for the types of problems for which we might expect MaxEnt RL to produce effective solutions. Specifically, our results suggest that domains with uncertainty in the task goal may be especially well-suited for MaxEnt RL methods.

However, building simulators is expensive (requires manual effort for each and every scene) and creates challenges in transferring learned policies to robotic platforms in the real-world, due to the sim-to-real domain gap. In this paper, we pose a simple question: Do we really need active interaction, ground-truth maps or even reinforcement-learning (RL) in order to solve the image-goal navigation task? We propose a self-supervised approach to learn to navigate from only passive videos of roaming. Our approach, No RL, No Simulator (NRNS), is simple and scalable, yet highly effective. NRNS outperforms RL-based formulations by a significant margin. We present NRNS as a strong baseline for any future image-based navigation tasks that use RL or Simulation.",,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/1180/122/798/616e374a5244ab9dcbd1b2d3_0.pdf

Efficient dialogue management policy helps systems to respond to the user in an effective way. Policy learning is a complex task to build a dialogue system. There are different approaches have been proposed in the last decade to build a goal-oriented dialogue agent to train the systems with an efficient policy. The Generative adversarial network (GAN) is used in the dialogue generation, in previous works to build dialogue agents by selecting the optimal policy learning. The efficient dialogue policy learning aims to improve the quality of fluency and diversity for generated dialogues. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are used to optimize the policies because the sequence is discrete. In this study, we have proposed a new technique called Cascade Generative Adversarial Network (Cas-GAN) that is combination of the GAN and RL for dialog generation. The Cas-GAN can model the relations between the dialogues (sentences) by using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). The graph nodes are consisting of different high level and low-level nodes representing the vertices and edges of the graph. Then, we use the maximum log-likelihood (MLL) approach to train the parameters and choose the best nodes.

One of the most commonly used algorithms in prediction is the RLS algorithm. This algorithm because of its good convergence rate has many applications. But RLS algorithm tracks non exact and noisy measurements the same as it tracks the signal. In this work, with appropriate the combination of the RLS and the MAP, an RLS algorithm with filtered input is presented. In this algorithm the MAP estimation is used as an input filter to the RLS algorithm for mitigating the noise effect. In order to determine the mean of the noise in MAP algorithm, we use a recursive method based on the RLS error. It can be proved that the mean square error in the proposed algorithm which we call it Modified RLS (MRLS) is reduced at least to the same amount as the conventional RLS algorithm. This method is tested in two different areas, namely, the prediction of a noisy sinusoidal chirp signal and multiple objects tracking of vehicles in the traffic scene.",,//static.aminer.org/pdf/PDF/000/313/080/vehicle_tracking_at_traffic_scene_with_modified_rls.pdf

The diode is represented by an equivalent circuit, which in the general case includes a nonlinear resistor and two nonlinear capacitances - barrier and diffusion. With certain ratios of the frequency of the current and the parameters of the circuit, the transition process for the period of oscillation of the input voltage hasn't time to finish. In this case, at the beginning of each period there is a residual voltage on the capacitances, that is, each new cycle of the transition process has non-zero initial conditions. It is noted that the residual voltage in each period is different; therefore, the current in the circuit in each period is also different. Thus, in this case, a continuous transition occurs, the parameters of which are chaotic. The simulation of the phenomenon of ""deterministic chaos"" was carried out in the environment of the MicroCap circuit simulation program. During the simulation for each type of diode, the set of circuit parameters f, R, L (frequency, load resistance, inductance) was divided into two subsets - a subset for which the transition process during the oscillation period of the input voltage has time to finish (the residual voltage on the capacitance is almost zero) and the mode of operation of the circuit can be considered deterministic, and a subset for which the transient process during the oscillation period of the input voltage doesn't attenuate (the residual voltage on the capacitance is significantly different from zero) and the mode of operation of the circuit can be considered chaotic.

Correlations between basinal evaporite-bearing series and marginal carbonate platforms allow for improvement of the classical depositional models, especially concerning the eustatic control of the environmental changes in the Mediterranean. These changes were controlled by the interplay of aperiodic and periodic factors: (1) tectonics, related to the relative motions of the African and Furasian plates and resultant linear increase in basin restriction; (2) sea-level fluctuations that alternately aggravated the restriction or allowed marine replenishment, and (3) climatic fluctuations that controlled the level of the Mediterranean during stages of isolation. The Messinian sedimentary succession reflects a typical sequence of progressive isolation: marine marls --> laminites --> transitional deposits --> evaporites --> lacustrine deposits. The structure of the carbonate platforms shows that during early Messinian time, the sea-level regime changed from a highstand (TB3.2 cycle) that was responsible for widespread extension of the carbonate platforms to the classical ""Messinian regression"" that induced final isolation of the Mediterranean water body and onset of the so-called ""salinity crises."" The first stage of the crisis was characterized by a Mediterranean lowstand that resulted in erosion of former platforms and deposition of the lower evaporites. During the next stage, sea level rose (TB3.3 cycle) high enough to temporarily replenish the basin (cyclic upper evaporites, with development of stromatolite-rich deposits). Finally, the uppermost Messinian freshwater to brackish lacustrine deposits reflect both the cessation of sea-water input (maximum tectonic isolation, low sea level) and freshwater input related to increasing runoff.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/71/E7/A6/71E7A658E3AA4F7ECD1FB256B87205A8.pdf

A fourth line will be added in 2000, and further extensions will soon follow. Ultra-modern light rail vehicles now move fast over this smart, environmentally friendly system.

No other city so small (population 325,000) has a fully independent Stadtbahn of its own, with light rail in tunnels through the city centre and laid on reserved track in the suburbs. The new stations have 860mm high platforms, and the tram floors have 920mm height, to facilitate easy boarding and alighting; the trams also have adjustable steps, as 16 of the stations still have low platforms. The trams can also carry bicycles. The system has retained its original 1m gauge, because it has proved so reliable, and because it prevented the need to build a second depot for public transport vehicles. All bus lines feed the Stadtbahn, run every 10min, and have excellent interchanges.

These sediments are very thick (up to 55 m) and homogeneous, composed of lake marl and calcareous gyttja. They are thoroughly interpreted in terms of geological and palaeobiological studies (palynology, macrofossils, diatoms and malacofauna) and represent continuous deposition. Analysis of stable oxygen and carbon isotopes in these deposits and of the shells of the malacofauna enables interpretation of the changes in the palaeoclimate and sedimentary environment that occurred in lake basins during this part of the Pleistocene. Maximum δ 18 O (-3,6‰) and minimum values of δ 13 C (-6,4‰) correspond to the first part of the interglacial optimum, while minimum δ 18 O values (-10,1‰) and maximum δ 13 C values (10,0‰) correspond to the coldest period, directly preceding the following glaciation. Climatic changes are well documented by isotopic curves correlated with the results of pollen analysis. The isotopic curves indicate relatively cool climatic conditions at the climatic optimum of the Mazovian Interglacial. This may have been caused by increased atmospheric precipitation that led to deepening of the lakes, and/or by influx of ground waters enriched in light isotopes. In the upper part of the successions, corresponding to the initial stage of the following glaciation, the concentration of 18 O and 13 C increases, which was probably associated with the lake shallowing and with enrichment in heavy isotopes through evaporation under conditions of a cool steppe climate and/or with the redeposition of “warm” interglacial deposits from shore areas exposed as the result of lake shallowing. The isotopic curves clearly illustrate changes in the relative influence of maritime and continental air circulation during the Mazovian Interglacial. The studied lakes were oligo- or mesotrophic with dominant influence of continental air circulation before the interglacial climatic optimum. Maritime air circulation prevailed during the interglacial climatic optimum and the lakes became eutrophic. Cyclic climatic cooling during the post-interglacial period is recorded in oxygen isotopic curves trending towards their lower values. The carbon isotopic curves reach higher values, which is related to climatic cooling and shallowing of the lakes, caused by their infilling with deposits.",,

In 2005 the number rose to 46%. * In a somewhat more technically advanced procedure, 72% used intranets to store firmwide information (such as personnel and procedure manuals) in 2005, up from 64% in 2003. * On average, firms of 100+ CPAs rated not much better than smaller firms in 2003. But the 100+ group showed a significant gain two years later. * The number of firms that stored audit workpapers in paperless software applications--a key sign of a paperless CPA office--showed a huge 103% growth last year over 2003. ********** OK, you regularly scan your clientsu0027 tax returns and store them electronically You even use your computer to prepare invoices, which you e-marl to clients.

A PAPERLESS GAIN To assess how far youu0027ve advanced toward a paperless model, compare your office with CPA firms of similar size that responded to surveys conducted by the Association for Accounting Administrators (AAA) in 2003 and again last year (see the exhibit below and online at www.aicpa. org/pubs/jofa/may2006/zarowin.htm). The AAA sent its initial survey to its 600 members, and of the 140 who responded, 51% said they had implemented at least some of the 21 paperless functions asked about in the survey When the AAA repeated the survey, it added four functions and the use rate rose to 67%--a 22% improvement. Lacking any other comprehensive measure of the rate of paperless growth, consider those figures an index of how CPAs are using less paper and more technology. Applying some technology to a few office functions is hardly enough to justify calling your office paperless. A true paperless office has not only added new technology, itu0027s redesigned many manual processes so the technology and the revised processes work together to speed and enhance office operations. Some functions require new hardware, such as a scanner to convert paper-document images to digital code; others require only a process change, such as asking clients to send their data as digital files rather than as documents. Letu0027s look at some of the processes the AAA included in the surveys. Firms that responded affirmatively to most of the queries can be considered nearly paperless. Weu0027ll begin with those functions that are the easiest to implement--requiring no technology, only changes in mind-set to take first steps into a paperless revolution. STILL USE BILLING SHEETS Firms were asked whether they prepared invoices directly on the computer rather than having someone in the firm prepare them on paper, using typical billing sheets. In the 2003 survey, only 38% used the computer--even though it would have been far simpler and faster that way. When the survey was repeated in 2005, use of the computer for billing rose to 46%--a 21% gain. But in last yearu0027s survey, only 27% said they then delivered those electronically prepared invoices to the client via email or digital fax. So instead of using a few mouse dicks, 73% actually addressed an envelope, inserted the invoice, stamped it and mailed it. …",,

The asphaltenes had been extracted from a floating block of Dead Sea asphalt, and heated at 100 - 200 degrees C for 1-12 days. This oxygenic kerogenization reaction follows first-order kinetics. The half-life (t(1/2)) of the asphaltenes (i.e. the time in which 50% of the asphaltenes had been converted to artificial kerogen) varied from 2,300 clays at 0 degrees C, to 2 days at 100 degrees C. Similar results were obtained with asphaltenes which had been extracted from a number of bitumen-bearing rocks in the Dead Sea area (from the Amiaz, Ein Boqeq, Nebi Mussa and Ef'e boreholes), and also from sandstones from the Heimar and IPRG boreholes which were impregnated with heavy or asphaltic crudes. These and other results suggest that low-temperature (less than or equal to 100 degrees C) oxygen ic kerogenization of Dead Sea asphaltenes (with or without the mediation of meteoric waters) may be a pathway for the formation of kerogen. Asphaltenes extracted from other bituminous rocks - the La Luna limestone (U. Cretaceous, Venezuela); the Serpiano marl (M. Triassic, Switzerland); the Messel shale (Tertiary, Germany); and the Aleksinac shale (Tertiary, Yugoslavia)- underwent laboratory kerogenization in a similar fashion to the Dead Sea materials.

The tuffs are characterised as ash-, fine ash- and in some cases as welded ash tuffs. Crystal-,lappili- and breccia tuffs also occur. The tuffs are built up of glass shards, pumice shards and crystal fragments which are cemented by glassy material. Crystal fragments are represented by quartz crystals. Plagioclase, albite, sanidine and biotite exist as well. Essentially, the vitric parts of the tuffs are altered to zeolites (heulandite 2 and/or mordenite, analcime, laumontite / scolecite), clay minerals (smectite, kaolinite +/or mixed layer I/S of regular type), Si02 minerals (quartz, cristobalite) and K-feldspar. For the purposes of this study, firstly, standard portland cement concrete specimens and concrete specimens with pyroclastic material from three different places, replacing portland cement by 20%, were prepared. The mineralogical composition of the samples under study and the area where they come from, is as follows: a. Iampolis: analcime + quartz + K-feldspar + albite + Illite/Smectite b. Darmeni : analcime + quartz + K-feldspar + albite + calcite c. Skaloma : smectite + cristobalite + heulandite-2 + mordenite + K-feldspar + quartz The compressive strength of the prepared specimens after periods of 7 and 28 days was measured and the pozzolanic activity of the samples was calculated according to ASTM Standard C618. Following the first test, the pozzolanic activity of a second sample from Iampolis area was more extensively studied. The compressive strength of concrete specimens made of 100% Portland cement of 145 type, and concrete specimens that were prepared by replacing Portland cement in proportions of 10, 20, 30 and 40% was determined. From the results of this study it is concluded that the analcimic tuffs could be a potential source for pozzolanic cement. More extensive study is needed for the estimation of the percentage of the altered pyroclastics that gives the optimum results concerning the cement pozzolanic activity. The optimization of the pozzolanic properties of the altered pyroclastics by calcination may be investigated as well.",,

At least three high concentration fossiliferous horizons occur within a stratigraphic thickness of about 2 m and a distance of some 2 m. The fossils are well-preserved, though many are broken due to the circumstances of the discovery. The new fossil locality is from the Bakhtiari Formation, which is the last synorogenetic deposit of the Zagros foreland basin and has a stratigraphic thickness of up to 3000 m and extends for over 1000 km along the SW of the Zagros Mountains. Because of its relevance for the orogenetic history of these mountains, the age of this formation is under discussion with proposed ages varying between latest Oligocene to Pleistocene. The preliminary identifications of the fossils lead to the recognition of seven to eight species of Carnivora, Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla: Felidae indet., Hipparion spp. A & B (Equidae), Giraffidae indet. and Gazella sp., Boselaphini indet, Bovidae indet. spp. 1 & 2 (Bovidae).

These limestones have been previously attributed to the Upper Pliensbachian (Domerian) on the supposed age of the large bivalves assemblages (mainly Opisoma, Cochlearites, Lithioperna). We have collected a Tropidoceras sp. in the bedded limestones covering the bioaccumulations with Cochlearites sp. and rare Opisoma menchikoffi. These new data indicate that these bivalve beds have been deposited from the Demonense Zone upward. The lack of ammonites prevents a more precise dating of the top of this formation. On the Bou Dahar plateau (top of the palaeo-shoal), it is overlain by condensed beds yielding Upper Toarcian and Aalenian ammonites. This change in the environment resulted from the breaking and of the sinking of the platform and it is illustrated by large fissures developed inside the shallow Pliensbachian carbonates which are filled up by Toarcian-Aalenian ammonites-bearing pink micrites. This palaeostructure is surrounded and sealed by marls and marry limestones. The Sebbab Sghrir profile indicates a succession of five foraminifera assemblages from the late Carixian to the early Bajocian.

During the early Bajocian, the succession of two microfaunas, 4 and 5, is displayed. Their boundary coincides with the limit between the Concavum and Discites ammonite zones. The protoglobigerinids appearance (FAD; 5b) is linked to the structural homogeneization of the region. The Bou Dahar shoal has been previously differentiated around a Palaeozoic relief. The structural pattern consisted of E-W faults crossed by transverse NW-SE or SSW-NNE faults as it is documented by the eastern and western rapid change from the shallow platform to the open sea domain. The Toarcian and Aalenian marls onlap the shoal to the west, indicating that the palaeostructure was dissymetric.

Our high-resolution studies (chemical elements, 613C, 6180, calcareous nannofossils, planktic and benthic foraminifera) show that below the marl-clay transition there is a 40-50 cm thick interval (corresponding to 10-20 kyr) containing a detailed record of a gradual succession of faunal and geochemical events culminating in the benthic extinctions. Planktic foraminiferal and nannofossil changes (e.g., the onset of demise in Fasciculithus genus) occur a few meters below the marl-clay transition. In the limestone 50 cm below the base of the clay, a prominent glauconite maximum indicates that sea-floor oxygenation suddenly decreased. Glauconite continues to be common until the onset of clay deposition. A whole-rock negative 613C shift (1.6%0), most likely reflecting an original sea-water trend, is gradually developed over the 40 cm of greenish brown marls immediately below the clay. At the base of these marls there is a small, significant iridium anomaly of 133 ppt Ir compared with an average background of 38 ppt. In the marls the demise of the Fasciculithus species accelerates, Gavelinella beccariiformis becomes extinct, and the abundance of Acarinina species begins to increase. The superjacent 4 m of clay is devoid of original calcite in its lower part and has a low calcareous content higher up. At calcareous levels in the clay an unusual planktic foraminifera fauna occurs, dominated by Acarinina species. When marl deposition returns, 613C gradually increases and then stabilizes at values about 0.5%o lower than before the isotopic excursion. The 613C excursion spans in total 5 m, probably corresponding to 200-400 kyr. The fasciculiths disappear shortly after the stabilization of 613C. Here we also present a whole-rock 6~3C profile through the entire Paleocene section at Zumaya. The profile is very similar to previous profiles registered in well preserved deep-sea material, suggesting that whole-rock 613C at Zumaya can be used for correlation.",,

The late Miocene to early Pliocene interval preceding this progradation was characterised in northern Taranaki Basin by the accumulation of hemipelagic mudstone (Manganui Formation), volcaniclastic sediments (Mohakatino Formation), and marl (Ariki Formation), all at bathyal depths. The Manganui Formation has generally featureless wireline log signatures and moderate to low amplitude seismic reflection characteristics. Mohakatino Formation is characterised by a sharp decrease in the GR log value at its base, a blocky GR log motif reflecting sandstone packets, and erratic resistivity logs. Seismic profiles show bold laterally continuous reflectors. The Ariki Formation has a distinctive barrel-shaped to blocky GR log motif. This signature is mirrored by the SP log and often by an increase in resistivity values through this interval. The Ariki Formation comprises (calcareous) marl made up of abundant planktic foraminifera, is 109 m thick in Ariki-1, and accumulated over parts of the Western Stable Platform and beneath the fill of the Northern Graben. It indicates condensed sedimentation reflecting the distance of the northern region from the contemporary continental margin to the south. The latest Miocene (Kapitean) age of Ariki Formation beneath the Northern Graben gives a maximum age for the start of crustal extension in the basin; a minimum early Pliocene (Opoitian) age is provided by the age of the base of the Mangaa Formation, which infills part of the graben. Uplift on the margins of the graben allowed condensed Ariki Formation to continue to accumulate into the Waipipian. The Mangaa Formation has blocky to tabular profiles on SP and resistivity logs, particularly in Mangaa-1. The formation comprises several sandstone-dominated submarine fan deposits that thicken into the master graben fault. Accumulation of the Mangaa Formation within the graben continued into the Waipipian when it was supplanted by the bottom-sets of the Giant Foresets Formation.

Twenty-four megalospheric specimens have been obtained by means of a random picking on washing residues of a marl layer sampled in the Samatzai Miocene succession (Southern Sardinia), cropping out along the eastern side of the Plio-Pleistocene Campidano Graben. This succession has been mainly deposited into a neritic marine carbonate environment during the Early Miocene rift phase. M. globulina (Michelotti) has been detected in Sam-1 sample, at a central evolutionary stage of the species. It indicates a reference to a early-middle Burdigalian age, that is confirmed by the overlying planktonic foraminiferal assemblage.

Questa successione si è deposta inizialmente in ambiente neritico durante la fase miocenica del rifting sardo. Gli esemplari studiati sono stati ricavati dal residuo di lavaggio di un campione marnoso (Sam-1). I risultati delle misure e dei conteggi effettuati sugli apparati embrionali e nepionici, indicano che la popolazione del campione Sam-1 rientra nei limiti di Miogypsina globulina (Michelotti), con un grado evolutivo medio rispetto ad altre popolazioni delle stessa specie conosciute in letteratura. Sulla base di questi risultati, il campione Sam1 risulterebbe riferibile alla parte medio-bassa del Burdigaliano.

In this case, the “symmetrical (or closing) chamber”, placed at the meeting point of the two nepionic spirals from opposite directions, have been considered as 1/2 (XI) (De Mulder, 1975) or as whole chamber (XII) (Drooger, 1952, 1963; Raju, 1974; Schüttenhelm, 1976). γ° = The angle between the apical-frontal line of the test (AF) and the medio-embryonic line (ME) (Drooger, 1952). The apical-frontal line passes through the centre of the protoconch between the apex and the middle of the frontal edge. It divides the test into two approximately equal parts. The medio-embryonic line passes through the centres of the protoconch and the deuteroconch. The value of the angle γ° depends on the lenght of the nepionic spiral; it may be either positive or negative (Amato & Drooger, 1969; Raju, 1974; De Mulder, 1975): γ° is negative when the length of the principal spiral exceeds one whorl; in the case of shorter spiral or of two spirals round the protoconch, γ° is negative if the third chamber or the larger of the two PAC is turned towards the apex of the test. γ° = 0 when the apical-frontal line and the medioembryonic line coincide. γ° is positive when the length of the principal spiral is less than one whorl and the third chamber, or the larger of the two PAC, is turned towards the frontal edge of the test. V = the degree of symmetry of the spirals round the protoconch in specimens with two PAC. V is calculated by the formula V = α/β*200. In this equation the angle β represents the length of the arc relating to both the spirals round the protoconch, delimited by the half-lines with origin in the centre of the protoconch and passing through the points of contact between the walls of the two embryonic chambers, while the angle α represents the length of the arc relating to the shortest spiral. DI and DII = the diameters of the protoconch and of the deuteroconch, measured at right angles to the line joining the centers of the first two chambers (ME line).

62b4c9845aee126c0fff4433,Flodfund - Bronzealderdeponeringer fra Gudenåen,,[{'name': 'Lise Frost'}],"River findsBronze Age metalwork from the river GudenåBronze Age metalwork (primarily swords and other weapons) found in European rivers has aroused interest for many years, but little is known of corresponding finds from Denmark. The general Scandinavian tradition of offering differs in that it is associated more with bogs and wetlands than with rivers. This article examines the relevant records from Denmark’s longest river, the Gudenå, and adjacent areas, dating from the Late Neolithic, Bronze Age and Early Pre-Roman Iron Age. Remarkably, it turns out that there are significantly more Bronze Age river finds from the Gudenå itself (38 in all) than was previously realised. Consequently, the Gudenå finds stand out relative to the Scandinavian votive tradition. This phenomenon forges links with the far-reaching European tradition of offering metal objects in rivers and new insights add depth and detail to the overall picture of offering traditions in southern Scandinavia and put these finds into a landscape-archaeological perspective.The Gudenå is Denmark’s longest river, with its total length of river including Randers Fjord being c. 160 km. (fig. 1). Given its width and depth, it is the only Danish watercourse to achieve the status of an actual river. The religious name ‘Gudenå’ is one of the oldest names associated with a Danish watercourse. The name ‘Guden’ is its original name, found in documentary sources extending back to the Early Middle Ages, and should probably be understood in the sense of ‘consecrated to the gods’. The precise age of the name is uncertain, but according to place-name researchers a large proportion of the old uncompounded names originate from the 1st millennium AD – and some are even older.A particular stretch of the Gudenå, extending for about 20 km from Tange through Bjerringbro to Ulstrup, has a remarkable concentration of river finds, and is especially striking between Tange and Bjerringbro (fig. 2). The finds from this section of river are surprising in terms of the number of Bronze Age artefacts, especially daggers and swords, represented among them. Chronologically, they cover the entire Bronze Age, but with an emphasis on the earliest part of the period. In general, the majority of South Scandinavian depositions date from the Late Bronze Age, with bogs and wetland areas being the sites most used for these. However, this picture is challenged by the evidence from the Gudenå which – due to relatively numerous finds from the Early Bronze Age and single finds of weapons and tools in water – differs fundamentally from the general picture. Furthermore, the finds from the Gudenå reflect a common European view that swords, daggers and spears were the primary objects associated with deposition in rivers.Chronologically, depositions from the Bronze Age (c. 1700 500 BC) constitute the primary focus of the study, but finds from the Late Neolithic (c. 2350 1700 BC) and Early Pre-Roman Iron Age (c. 500 200 BC) are also included (figs. 3a-d). The main emphasis is on the river finds. However, in geographical terms, not only actual river finds have been included, but also depositions recorded within a distance of c. 1 km from the river on both sides.This study encompasses a total of 112 finds: 38 river finds, 30 from fields/meadows, 27 from bogs and two from marl pits. Further to these are 15 finds for which there is no information on their find context (figs. 4 and 5).Various circumstances are important with respect to the representativity of the finds from around Tange, Bjerringbro and Ulstrup. One important explanation for the many records is linked to the construction of a large hydro-electric power plant at Tange in 1921. Huge volumes of earth were moved in its construction (fig. 6) and a good number of archaeological artefacts were found in the process. Another explanation relates to the activities of amateur archaeologists, especially Ulrik Balslev, who was particularly active in the area around Bjerringbro; no fewer than 15 of the finds in this study are from his collection (for example a Hallstatt sword, fig. 7). In recent years, the use of metal detectors has also had a significant effect with respect to the number of finds from the area.Figure 8 shows all the single finds dating from the Late Neolithic. The most frequent river finds are flint daggers and sickles, of which some of the latter may also date from the Early Bronze Age. An uncultivated area of bog at Ulstrup near the Gudenå yielded two special bronze axes. These have flared edges and they show great similarity to Anglo-Irish ornamented bronze axes of the time (fig. 9). They are not identical in either decoration or form, but they must originally have belonged together, constituting a collective deposition.In the Early Bronze Age, metal daggers are a prominent artefact group and, seen in the light of river finds of flint daggers from the Late Neolithic, they demonstrate a continuity of dagger deposition in certain parts of the Gudenå (figs. 10 and 11). A Fårdrup type axe was also found in the Gudenå (fig. 12).In the Late Bronze Age there is a general increase in depositions in southern Scandinavia, culminating in period V (c. 900 700 BC). This general picture differs slightly from that of the Gudenå’s river finds, which reveals a preponderance of finds dating from the Early Bronze Age. Figure 13 shows the finds distribution for the Late Bronze Age. As can be seen, swords feature among the river-found artefacts and the more unusual of these include an example of each of the two rare, imported Hallstatt sword types, of which only six have been found to date in Denmark.Figures 8, 10 and 13 show, respectively, the distribution of single finds from the Late Neolithic and the Early and Late Bronze Age. If the figures are compared, it becomes clear that there are slightly different finds distributions with respect to bog, field and river finds. For example, the river finds include a number of flint daggers, and the metal daggers of the Early Bronze Age come exclusively from the river. The swords and spears of the Early Bronze Age also include a number of river finds, whereas an artefact group such as the celts occurs more in field and bog finds than as river finds. Even though their total number is not very great, a similar situation is evident with respect to the Early Bronze Age flanged axes. In general, it can be said that these single depositions are dominated by artefacts from the male sphere.The only Pre-Roman Iron Age finds recorded from the Gudenå in the finds-rich area around Bjerringbro are a bronze double-spiral fibula and a ring, and with these the river finds also come more or less to an end. There are though scattered finds of much later date associated with the river – including a Viking Age sword from the Randers area and a 16th century battle sword. These later finds underline the river’s continued significance as a locality for depositions further up in time and the remarkable continuity evident in the ancient votive traditions.In a Danish context, the Gudenå stands out by being the country’s longest watercourse and by having a name that indicates a special significance. There are also scattered records of swords from other Danish watercourses, such as the Early Bronze Age period III example from Nørreå and a sword blade from period I found in Odense Å, but the finds from the Gudenå stand out by virtue of the striking concentration seen around Tange, Bjerringbro and Ulstrup. This section apparently had a special significance in a depositional context, whereby the river, partly by virtue of its size, invited the deposition of weapons in open water. If it is assumed that the distribution of finds largely reflects a prehistoric reality, it was along specific stretches of the Gudenå that people showed a particular predilection for deposition in water. This seems plausible as there were presumably considerable regional and local variations in depositional tradition during the Bronze Age – bound up to a very great extent with various local landscape features. In this respect, the variation shown by the Gudenå along its course is important. Specific sections could therefore very well have been chosen as a particularly suitable depositional landscape on the basis of special natural criteria. In the area around Tange and Bjerringbro, the Gudenå runs through a pronounced valley, flanked by terraces, which fixes the river solidly in the landscape and this could have been significant with respect to the intensity of deposition seen here. The distribution of finds is also totally consistent with a clear tendency, in a European context, for depositions not to occur in all parts of a river or everywhere across a wetland area, but to be associated with particular zones or stretches.A characteristic feature of several of the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age finds from the Gudenå is that they turned up at the confluence of two watercourses (fig. 14). In a European perspective, many river finds are also typically associated with fords, bridges and crossings and several Danish examples have similar find contexts. A number of finds from the Gudenå are associated with presumed crossings although, in several cases, this categorisation is based solely on the place name for the find relating to a bridge or ford, for example Lysbro (fig. 15).The various find situations and characteristics relating to the choice of deposition site can either be assessed very locally, whereby each individual find site is examined in relation to water, crossings etc., or they can be evaluated collectively, as elements in the landscape at a greater geographic scale and, thereby, as components of a ritual landscape which may have existed over a longer period of time. The Tange, Bjerringbro and Ulstrup section of the river has both a concentration of river finds and also records from river-near areas of artefacts discovered in bogs and wetland areas. An appraisal of the natural environment along this stretch reveals a characteristic feature: The river runs through a distinctive valley flanked by terraces. Given the nature and distribution of the finds and the morphology of the landscape, the term ‘Heilig Tal’ can therefore be applied to the Tange, Bjerringbro and Ulstrup section of the Gudenå river valley. It is beyond the scope of this article to address grave and settlement remains associated with the river, but in the light of the concentration of finds and the area’s characteristic natural environment, it is interesting that it is generally rich archaeologically with several finds from the Late Bronze Age – including grave finds from some the area’s numerous barrows (fig. 16).The Gudenå finds stand out from the Scandinavian votive tradition as exemplified by the river finds of daggers. And while these finds display clear points of similarity with the river finds associated with the European tradition, there are also differences, because the relatively numerous Early Bronze Age artefacts from the Gudenå also confer a special individual character on the finds. In any case, the Bronze Age finds from the Gudenå provide an interesting example of how special depositional traditions can arise in particular areas, while otherwise only making a very slight impact in other places within the Nordic Bronze Age culture.Lise FrostMoesgaard Museum",,

High strontium and low iron as well as manganese and magnesium contents of belemnite calcite and bulk rock samples suggest no diagenetic overprint. However, the orange-coloured cathodoluminescence of coccolith-rich sediments indicates diagenetic cementation and/or recrystallization. The non-luminescent belemnite rostra reveal an extraordinary preservation of the microstructures that is interpreted to have been favoured by a silification of the outer rim of the belemnite rostra. Carbon isotope ratios of the coccolith limestones and belemnite rostra are comparable, with higher δ13C variations observed for belemnite calcite. The 1.5–2‰ depletion in δ18O of the marl-limestone rhythmites relative to belemnite calcite is explained by diagenetic alteration of the sediments. Palaeotemperatures, calculated from the δ18O values of the well-preserved belemnite rostra, are around 12.5 ± 2 °C and suggest rather low sea-surface temperatures for the Middle Campanian epicontinental sea of north Germany assuming a water depth of less than 100 m.",,

The aim is to clarify the stratigraphy of Oligo-Miocene sediments which crop out widely in thearea and were referred to the Pietra leccese and Andrano Calcarenite formations in the last edition of the Geologic Map of Italy. This study suggests a different stratigraphic scheme for the Copertino area with the occurrence of two different lithostratigraphic units - the Galatone Formation (Upper Oligocene) and the Lecce Formation (Lower Miocene) - between the Upper Cretaceous Altamura Limestone Formation and the Lower to Upper Miocene Pietra leccese formation. The Galatone Formation is characterized by whitish-greyish micritic limestone interbedded with centimetre-scale layers of whitish limestone and laminated yellowish calcareous marls. Their thickness commonly ranges from a few centimetres to several decimetres with frequent dominating plane laminae and stromatolitic structures. Fossils are abundant. represented mainly by gastropoda and ostracoda. Moreover, a new important outcrop referred to the Galatone Formation, 30 metres thick, has been identified. It is of interest because of the presence of a paleosol, varying from a few centimetres to around 50 cm thick, represented by brown sandy days devoid of fossils. The upper surface of the paleosol is undulating and in places is intersected by mud cracks. The paleosol underlies a characteristic marly horizon, around 70 cm thick, rich of Hydrobiidae. This stratigraphical datum could constitute an element of correlation with the type section of the Galatone Formation (Bossio et alii, 1999). The characters described are therefore distinctive of lagoonal sediments with continental intervals. The Lecce formation is made of shallow marine deposits characterized mostly by whitish massive calcarenites with more or less distinct decimetre-scale stratification, interbedded with rare greyish marly and micritic limestone.

BMI, waist circumference, skinfold thickness, bioimpedance analyses, blood pressure, physical activity based on questionnaires, and three-day-weighed dietary records were determined at baseline (T0) and 6 months (T1) later. Degree of overweight was calculated as BMI-SDS. Comparisons were performed on an intention-to-treat approach. Results The drop-out rate was 3% in IG and 16% in CG. At T1, 94% of the children in IG decreased their BMI-SDS and 24% of them were normal weight. The changes between T0 and T1 in BMI-SDS differed significantly ( p < 0.001) between IG and CG (CG: +0.05 ± 0.19 BMI-SDS; IG: −0.26 ± 0.22 BMI-SDS). Similar findings were observed for blood pressure, waist circumference, skinfold thickness, and fat mass based on bioimpedance analyses. In the IG, energy, fat and sugar intake decreased significantly between T0 and T1, while no significant changes were observed in the CG. Conclusions The lifestyle intervention was associated with an improvement of dietary patterns and was effective in reducing degree of overweight, fat mass, waist circumference, and blood pressure. Keywords Lifestyle intervention Overweight Children Randomized-controlled-trial Dietary records 1 Introduction The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence poses an ever-increasing problem. 1 Since childhood overweight affects both the children's health and their social integration and these children tend to become obese adults, 1 effective treatment concepts are needed. Long-term outpatient training programs consisting of a combination of physical exercise, nutrition education, and behaviour therapy have been recommended for obese children, but only few programs have run and have been evaluated in the past. 1–5 Even less is known concerning overweight children since up to now all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have focused on obese children. 4 Probably, similar positive effects as in obese children 3 can be reached in overweight children with less treatment intensity. Furthermore, the findings from interventions in obese children cannot be directly assigned to overweight children, since degree of overweight may influence the outcome. For example, lower weight may be associated with less treatment motivation or lower awareness of weight problems. Therefore, separate studies of lifestyle intervention in overweight children are necessary. We developed the lifestyle intervention program “Obeldicks light” according to the needs and abilities of overweight children based on the experiences of the lifestyle intervention “Obeldicks” for obese children. 6 The name “Obeldicks” is adapted from the popular French obese comic figure “Obelix”, which is associated with positive qualities such as strength. In this phase III trial, we studied the effectiveness of the lifestyle intervention “Obeldicks light”. Our primary hypothesis was that this lifestyle intervention is effective in reducing the degree of overweight based on standard deviation scores of body mass index. Since body mass index is only an indirect measurement of body composition we analyzed additionally the change of waist circumference and fat mass based on skinfold measurements and bioimpedance analyses as secondary outcomes. Furthermore, as marker for comorbidity of overweight, blood pressure was determined. Since a reduction of degree of overweight is primarily achievable by changing of dietary habits and physical activity, we analyzed as secondary outcomes also eating behaviour and physical activity by dietary records and questionnaires. 2 Methods 2.1 Design and population In order to be included in this study, the children had to be between 8 and 16 years old, overweight, apparently healthy and not on any medication, and attending a regular school. Obese children were excluded from the study. Overweight was defined by a BMI >90th percentile and <97th percentile using German percentiles. 7 Families were invited for participation in the randomized controlled trail (RCT) mainly by media (newspapers, radio) and their general practitioners, who were informed about this study by seminars and letters. The recruitment process between April 2007 and October 2008 has been described in detail previously 8 and is summarized in Fig. 1 . Fourteen of the 80 eligible overweight children and their families refused to participate in this study. Reasons for refusing participation or withdrawing consent were: no means of regular transport to the intervention centre (6×), attempt of the families to treat their overweight child by themselves (3×), death of a family member (1×), and duration of intervention was too short for family's expectation (1×). Additionally, the reasons for withdrawing participation in the study were unclear in three cases. The children were randomized in the control group (CG) (waiting period of 6 months) or in the intervention group (IG) (6 months intervention) using a computer generated randomization list. A total of 66 overweight children (control group: n = 32 including five drop-outs in the study period, intervention group: n = 34 including one drop-out in the study period) were included in the study (mean age 11.5 ± 1.6 years, 58% females, mean BMI at baseline 23.4 ± 1.5 kg/m 2 .) The study was an open randomized controlled trial since blinding was not possible due to the nature of the intervention. 2.2 Intervention The intervention “Obeldicks light” was offered in two cities (Marl and Datteln) in north-west Germany. The intervention was based on physical activity training, nutrition education, and behaviour counselling. Interventions were performed in group sessions and individual counselling for the child and his/her family. An interdisciplinary team of paediatricians, diet-assistants, psychologists, and exercise physiologists was responsible for the training. The intervention “Obeldicks light” was adapted from the well-established “Obeldicks” intervention for obese children. 6,9 Since the children were only overweight and not obese, the intervention was shortened from 1 year (“Obeldicks”) to 6 months (“Obeldicks light”) reducing the amount of physical activity training and the time- and cost-intensive individual counselling about 50%. Thirty-seven sessions for children, 6 sessions for parents, and 5 sessions for parents and children were offered with a total expenditure of 67 h for each family. The cost of intervention was 652 € per family and was financed completely by health insurances. The physical activity training took place once a week (1.5 h per session) during the entire 6-month intervention period and consisted of ball games, jogging, trampoline jumping, dancing for girls, wrestling for boys, and instructions in physical activity as part of every-day life, as well as in reduction of the amount of time spent watching television or playing computer games. The nutritional course was based on the prevention concept of the “Optimized mixed diet”. 10 Here the present scientific recommendations were translated into food-based dietary guidelines also considering the dietary habits of children and families in Germany. In contrast to the present-day diet of children in Germany with a fat-content of 38% of energy intake (E%), 13 E% proteins, and 49 E% carbohydrates including 14 E% sugar, the “Optimized mixed diet” was both fat and sugar reduced and contained 30 E% fat, 15 E% proteins, and 55 E% carbohydrates including 5 E% sugar. 6 The children followed a “traffic-light system” when selecting their food. In this system, the foods and drinks available in Germany were separated according to their fat and sugar contents into “red = stop”, “orange = consider the amount”, and “green = o.k. when hungry or thirsty”. The children were divided into groups according to their sex and age since the materials in the nutrition and eating behaviour course as well as the sport games in physical exercise were age- and gender- specific. The training program was divided into two phases (see Fig. 2 ): In the intensive phase (3 months), the children took part in the nutritional course and in the eating-behaviour course in six group-sessions each lasting for 1.5 h. At the same time, the parents were invited to attend six parents' evenings (1.5 h per session). Furthermore, a session of individual nutrition counselling was provided (30 min). In the establishing phase (3 months), one further session of individual nutrition counselling and three individual counselling sessions for the child and his/her parents (1 session per month) each lasting 30 min were provided based on systemic and solution-focused theories (for details see Ref.  [11] ). The complete materials and the exact description of the intervention is available as a training book. 12 2.3 Measurements In all children body mass index (BMI), skinfold thickness, waist circumference, bioimpedance analyses, and blood pressure were measured by the same investigator for both centres at baseline (T0) and after 6 months (T1). In the IG, BMI was also assessed directly at onset of the intervention, as sometimes a few weeks passed between randomization and onset of intervention in order to achieve homogeneous groups of children concerning age and gender since some parts of the intervention were age- and gender-specific. Height was measured to the nearest centimetre using a rigid stadiometer. Weight was measured unclothed to the nearest 0.1 kg using a calibrated balance scale. The degree of overweight was quantified using Cole's least mean square method, which normalized the BMI skewed distribution and expressed BMI as a standard deviation score (BMI-SDS). 13 Reference data for German children were used. 7 Reduction of overweight was defined by reduction of BMI-SDS since BMI is gender and age dependent in childhood. Triceps and subscapularis skinfold thickness was measured twice using a caliper and averaged to calculate the percentage of body fat using a skinfold thickness equation with the following formulas 14 : boys: body fat % = 0.783 × (subscapularis skinfold thickness + triceps skinfold thickness in mm) +1.6; girls: body fat % = 0.546 × (subscapularis skinfold thickness + triceps skinfold thickness in mm) + 9.7. Bioelectrical impedance was measured using leg–leg and hand–leg systems (BC418; TANITA, Uxbridge, UK). We used estimates of total body fat, lean body mass, and percentage body fat provided by the manufacturer's software based on age, gender, height, and weight. No information regarding the formulas used could be obtained from the manufacturer due to its commercially sensitive nature. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured according to current guidelines 15 at the right arm twice after a 10-minute rest in the supine position by using a calibrated sphygmomanometer and averaged. The cuff-size was based on the length and circumference of the upper arm and was as large as possible without having the elbow skin crease obstructing the stethoscope. 15 The intra-operator variability was <5% for SBP and DBP. For the evaluation of dietary intake, 3-day weighed dietary records were used. Children or their parents weighed and recorded all foods and fluids consumed as well as leftovers using electronic food scales (±1 g). Semi-quantitative recording (e.g. number of spoons, scoops) was allowed if weighing was not possible. Dietary records were evaluated in the Research Institute of Child Nutrition. Energy and nutrient intake were calculated using the nutrient database LEBTAB (Research Institute of Child Nutrition, 2002), which is continuously updated by all new recorded food items. For LEBTAB, nutrient contents of staple foods are taken from standard nutrient tables. Those of commercial food products are determined either by using the product labels or by simulating recipes from the ingredients listed, including fortification. Daily energy intake (kcal/day) and percentage energy (%E) from fat, protein, carbohydrates, and sugar were calculated. Sports activity was determined by a semi-quantitative questionnaire for children measuring physical activities not including school sport and exercise training in the intervention. The scales were 1 = never, 2 = once up to twice per month, 3 = once up to twice per week, 4 = three- up to five-times per week, 5 = every day). Sedentary time was determined by a questionnaire for children concerning television and computer consuming time per week. These questionnaires have been used in other studies 16 but not been validated so far concerning validity and reliability. Socio-economic status (SES) and migration background were determined by parent questionnaires using well established German instruments. 17,18 SES was based on parents' education, occupational state, and household income. Thirty-two percent of the children had low, 45% medium and 23% high SES. Migration background was inferred when one or both parents' nationality or country of birth was not German(y). Eleven percent of the children had a migration background, 89% of the children were German Caucasian. 2.4 Statistical analysis All data analysis was carried out according to a pre-established analysis plan. Data were presented as mean and standard deviation. Two sided significance tests on an alpha = 0.05 level were used throughout. All variables except TV consumption in the questionnaires were normally distributed as tested by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. In order to follow an intention-to-treat analysis approach (ITT) all missing values at follow-up due to drop-out were set back to baseline values except for dietary records. To answer the main research question a two sample t -test was calculated considering all participants as allocated (ITT) and comparing the changes in BMI-SDS between the control and intervention group. In the analyses of the secondary outcomes, univariable comparisons of study characteristics at baseline were carried out with t -tests or Fisher exact tests as appropriate. Comparisons between baseline and 6 months later were performed by paired t -test or Wilcoxon test and comparisons between changes of variables between the control group and intervention group were analyzed by unpaired t -tests or Mann Whitney U-test as appropriate. Dietary patterns were analyzed only in children with dietary records at both baseline and follow-up. 2.5 Sample size estimation Based on a preceding phase-II feasibility cross-over trial in 19 additional overweight children (at baseline 10.7 ± 2.1 years, 68% female, mean BMI-SDS 1.58 ± 0.19, mean BMI 22.6 ± 1.8 kg/m 2 ) the required sample size of this study was estimated. The control period consisted of a 6 months period prior to the intervention start of “Obeldicks light”. The 19 overweight children in the pilot study increased their degree of overweight significantly in the first 6 months while waiting for the intervention (mean increase of mean increase of BMI-SDS 0.15 ± 0.19 and of BMI 1.1 ± 0.9 kg/m 2 ). In the following 6-month intervention period, BMI-SDS (mean change −0.45 ± 0.21) and BMI (mean change −1.7 ± 0.9 kg/m 2 ) decreased significantly ( p < 0.001). Based on these results and to get a conservative sample size estimate, the mean difference was reduced by 50% and the standard deviation was increased by 50% yielding 0.225 as group-difference in BMI-SDS change and 0.315 for its standard deviation. On an alpha = 0.05 level, two sided tests, a control to intervention ratio of 1 and 80% power a sample size of 64 (32 per group) was estimated for this study. All calculations were carried out using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and Winstat for Exel ® (R. Fitch Software, Bad Krozingen, Germany). 2.6 Ethical approval The local ethics committee of the University of Bremen approved this study. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects and their parents prior to study start. 3 Results In the randomized controlled trial, the children in the intervention and control groups did not differ significantly at baseline in respect of age ( p = 0.747), gender ( p = 0.803), BMI-SDS ( p = 0.187), waist circumference ( p = 0.142), triceps skinfold thickness ( p = 0.356), subscapularis skinfold thickness ( p = 0.875), lean body mass ( p = 0.891), fat mass ( p = 0.319), percentage body fat based on bioimpedance analyses ( p = 0.119), systolic blood pressure ( p = 0.237), or diastolic blood pressure ( p = 0.173) (see Table 1 ). Only one child (3%) dropped out of the intervention group, and 5 children (16%) dropped out of the control group (see Fig. 1 ). In the IG, all children and their parents except for the family who dropped-out participated in >95% of all sessions. In the CG, BMI increased significantly, while BMI-SDS, waist circumference, body fat, skinfold thickness, and blood pressure did not change significantly (see Table 1 ). In the IG, BMI, BMI-SDS, waist circumference, body fat, skinfold thickness, and blood pressure decreased significantly (see Table 1 ). The primary analysis was intention-to-treat (ITT) and compared the changes of BMI-SDS. BMI-SDS changes were significantly different across the control and intervention group (see Table 2 ). Secondary outcomes also demonstrated a significant change-difference in an ITT approach for all measurements between the control and intervention group except for lean body mass (see Table 2 ). In the IG, 94% of the children reduced their degree of overweight, and 24% were normal weight at the end of intervention. Girls and boys did not differ in their degree of BMI-SDS reduction in the IG ( p = 0.228), and the two intervention locations did not differ significantly in respect of BMI-SDS reduction either ( p = 0.276). In the time between baseline measurement and the onset of intervention in the RCT (in mean 2.6 months), the degree of overweight increased significantly (BMI-SDS +0.09 ± 0.12, p < 0.001). Analyzing the effect of intervention in the RCT between baseline and the end of intervention (rather than between onset of intervention and end of intervention), the success rate was 76% and the BMI-SDS reduction (in mean −0.17 ± 0.25) was also significant ( p < 0.001). A total of 6 children in the IG and 22 children in the CG did not perform dietary records at T1. At baseline, the dietary records of these children did not differ significantly from those of the children performing dietary records after 6 months in respect of daily energy intake and percentages of fat, protein, carbohydrate and sugar consumption. In the IG, energy intake (kcal/day), percentage fat, and sugar content in diet decreased significantly, while percentage protein content in diet increased significantly between baseline and the end of intervention (see Table 3 ). In the CG, no significant changes were observed in the dietary records between baseline and 6 months later. The dietary records of the children in the CG did not differ significantly from those of the children in the IG at baseline in respect of daily energy intake and percentages of fat, protein, carbohydrate, and sugar consumption (see Table 3 ). The children in the CG and IG did not differ significantly in respect of their sports activity or TV and computer consumption at baseline (see Table 4 ). In the IG and CG the frequency of sport activity increased, while TV and computer consumption did not change significantly in the CG and IG (see Table 4 ). No adverse events were observed. 4 Discussion This is the first randomized controlled trial of a lifestyle intervention in overweight, but not obese children demonstrating that the lifestyle intervention “Obeldicks light”, which was based on the combination of individual care and group sessions as well as an intensive education of parents, was effective to reduce degree of overweight and to improve body composition. Given the observed values of the difference and standard deviations of BMI-SDS change ( Table 2 ) the actual power of this study was >0.999 at a random error level of 0.05. The achieved reduction of overweight was clinically relevant as demonstrated by a reduction of fat mass both in bioimpedance analyses and skinfold thickness measurements. Lean body mass increased in children in the intervention group demonstrating the improvement of body composition. Additionally, waist circumference, which is highly predictive for cardiovascular risk factors, 19 was reduced significantly in the intervention group. Furthermore, blood pressure decreased significantly in the intervention group. The achieved reduction of overweight was comparable to effects of lifestyle intervention in obese children. 1,4,20–28 This finding seems remarkable since only 50% of the physical activity lessons as well as time- and cost-intensive individual counselling were used in “Obeldicks light” as compared to the lifestyle intervention “Obeldicks” for obese children. Furthermore, the success rate in our study was much higher as compared to these studies in obese children using much more intensive interventions suggesting that an early intervention in overweight, but not obese children is preferable. The need of an early intervention is also underpinned by the facts that the overweight children in the control group gained weight without intervention just as the overweight children in the intervention group prior to intervention between baseline measurement and the onset of intervention. In our study, the reduction of overweight was independent of age and gender of the children assuming age- and gender-specificity of the intervention. Since physical activity training, behaviour counselling, and nutritional education were performed simultaneously in the intervention group, we cannot distinguish the impact of each of them on overweight reduction. Furthermore, the effects of dieting and increased physical activity probably strengthened each other. However, the lifestyle intervention was associated with an improvement of dietary patterns (significant reduction of energy (kcal/day), fat consumption, and sugar consumption) in the IG but not in the CG. Since the CG and IG did not differ in their sports activities and the intervention failed to decrease TV and computer consumption, which is one of the most important goals in lifestyle intervention of overweight children, 2,4 the reduction of overweight achieved in our lifestyle intervention seems to be caused primarily by changes of dietary patterns. 4.1 Strengths and limitations The strength of this study is the randomized design and the measurement not only of weight but also of waist circumference, fat mass using bioimpedance analysis and skinfold thickness. Furthermore, analyzing dietary records and the questionnaires concerning physical activity helps understanding how the intervention works. Since the intervention was offered at two different treatment centres, which did not differ in the outcomes of their patients, this finding supports the generalisability of our intervention. Moreover, all materials and the exact intervention are published in a training manual 12 allowing to establish the intervention at different treatment centres. However, this study has a few important potential limitations. First, drop-outs may have influenced our findings. However, we performed an intention-to-treat approach analysis. Second, the relevance of overweight reduction has to be studied not only from a medical point of view but also of from the patient's point of view. Therefore, we intend analyzing the change of quality of life in this randomized controlled study. Third, self-reported data were used to measure dietary habits and physical activity and it can be questioned as to what extent they reflect the real habits. Underreporting is a well-known phenomenon in obese subjects. 1 The relative low reported energy consumption (kcal/kg) in the children at baseline might represent a hint towards underreporting. The surprising finding of an increase in sports activities in the control group which is unusual at this age in Germany, 29 as well as the relative low TV and computer consumption per week as compared to healthy German children 30 at baseline in both IG and CG may represent a hint that the questionnaires not necessarily reflect actual physical activity behaviour. Therefore, conclusions based on self-reported data such as dietary records and questionnaires have to be drawn only very cautiously. Fifth, other predictor factors not analyzed in this study (for example maternal BMI) may have influenced our results. 9,31 However, we have demonstrated in a previous study that our study population did not differ from a general population in Germany concerning social or migration status 8 also supporting the generalisability of our results. Sixth, changes of body composition measured by BIA have been criticised since BIA tend to overestimate fat-free mass in longitudinal analyses. 32 Seventh, the cost-effectiveness of the intervention has to been evaluated. However, such analyses are difficult to perform since the exact long-term health benefit and therefore financial benefit for health insurances of a BMI reduction is unclear in childhood. Finally, long-term follow-up studies are necessary to prove maintenance of weight status after the end of intervention. Accordingly, we start to analyze the effect of this intervention 12 and 24 months after the end of intervention in an ongoing study. In summary, the 6-month lifestyle intervention “Obeldicks light” led to a reduction of overweight and an improvement in dietary patterns. The achieved reduction of overweight was independent of age and gender and was clinically relevant, since it was associated with a reduction of fat mass, waist circumference, and blood pressure values.

53e9b029b7602d9703a84618,Derwent student hospitalised following violent attack in bar,,[{'name': 'Raf Sanchez'}],"A STUDENT WAS hospi- talised following a violent attack in Derwent Bar on Saturday after the screening of the Scotland-Wales rugby match. The student, Chris Wiggins, was left bleeding from the head after being set upon by four assailants. Wiggins said that before the attack he had been ""cheering for Scotland"" and that ""there was a bit of a ban- ter going around, but it was- n't really aimed at anyone."" The attackers, who are thought to be fellow stu- dents, were sitting a few tables in front of Wiggins during the match, and cheering for Wales. Another student present at the time said he heard them shouting ""get that jock of a c***"" before getting up to leave fol- lowing Wales' 21-9 defeat. Wiggins claims that ""on the way out they turned over the table, I said something and then they started to hit me."" The fighting in the din- ing hall section of the bar was quickly broken up by other students, many of whom were still wearing Dalmatian outfits from the RAG parade which had taken place earlier in the day. Attempting to calm the situ- ation, they moved Wiggins out of the bar and into the hallway. According to witnesses, Wiggins was waiting for his friends when the attackers emerged from the bar, only to knock him to the floor and kick him repeatedly in the head. They further told how, when hearing the commo- tion outside, students in the bar rushed out and again separated the fighting. One student who had been involved in breaking up both fights commented that it was during the second attack that ""most of the damage was done."" Wiggins was then taken into the Derwent JCR to wait for security to arrive. The attackers returned to the JCR a number of times in an attempt to continue the attack. Will Marle, a student who helped Wiggins into the JCR, said that he and others ""had to basically guard the door to keep them out."" Former JCR Chair Dave Jones, who was involved in breaking up the fighting said it was ""at least 15 minutes"" before security guards The University is pursuing its own internal investigation into the attack. A member of the bar staff working during the event has given physical descriptions of the attackers. However, the investiga- tion has been complicated by the fact that the lights in the dining area were switched off during the match, severely limiting the clarity of the existing CCTV footage. The fact that the attack occurred after the match had ended, as many people were leaving the bar, has further hindered attempts to identify the assailants through surveil- lance equipment. Speaking after the attack, one student said that it was difficult to break up the fight without the ""authority of a porter on- hand"" and that had a porter been present it ""might have helped stop the situation in the first place."" Bar staff called security as soon as the fight broke out and were told that a security response would be mobilised. However, staff claim that when they called again to see how much longer they would have to wait, they were unable to get through. The porters at Langwith and Goodricke were also called to the scene of the attack, forcing them to close their lodges, leaving the main campus without any open porters' lodges.",,

At present, 23,628 ha or 8% remains in an active state (Foss 1998), while at least 60,000 ha will be cutaway by the middle of the next century (Egan 1998). Industrial exploitation through milling involves the gradual removal of layers of peat until the less combustible fen peat is reached. On abandonment, the substrate is generally a mix of acid and alkaline peats and even occasionally lake marl and boulder clay. The surface level tends to be below the average water-table and in recent years areas of cutaway have been flooded to create lakes. Water is chiefly supplied by groundwater and precipitation, but some lakes may be fed by drains or small streams. these water-bodies have been allowed to colonise naturally.
The development of macroinvertebrate communities was studied in two such lakes in central Ireland. As part of a wider investigation, Corixidae were sampled regularly over the course of a year and the animals examined. Interesting comparisons between sexes and between lakes were made.",,

Coherence images derived from fringe pairs with temporal separation from 70 to 526 days of Almeria region and from two one-day tandem pairs of Granada region were analysed in conjunction with interferograms, topographic maps, TM images and geological maps. Evidences of rapid erosion were found on the slopes of marls where the vegetation cover is nearly none. The comparison between two coherence images of tandem pairs taken across a rainfall event and in dry conditions revealed the dynamics of rainfall/erosion process in relation to slope, lithology and vegetation cover. Large areas of disturbed lands were defined by image features with high coherence in 70 but de-coherence in 140 days. These features closely correspond to the recent massive plantation of olive and almond trees on gentle slopes of phyllites and schists. The stripping off the nature vegetation and surface crust of the land makes the thin soil vulnerable to erosion.",,

Thanks to the complementary investigation depth of these methods in the range 0-15 m, it was possible to recognise the substrate morphology of this lacustrine basin and to precisely outline the variations of the thickness of lacustrine infillings over an area of 10 hectares. The dip (10 degrees SE) of the limestones relief and the topographic irregularity due to fractures generate the thickness variations of the infillings. Three lacustrine sub-basins separated by an uplifting of the portlandian limestones were observed. The spatial extent of a drainage paleochannel running to the exsurgence have been detected. The geophysical data, added to the geological information show that the post glacial lake does not directly result from the glacier advance. It is mainly due to the tectonic structure of the area and to the impervious purbeckian marl, both factors generating the development of the lacustrine sub-basins.",,

Since then it has undergone terrestrial land development for more than 100 Million years. Old soil formations of Cretacous and Tertiary period have been mainly removed by erosion because of epirogenic uplift of the area by 1,000 in. However, in the south of this limestone plateau during the development of the alpine orogeny, there was a sedimentary basin formed between the Alps and the Swabian Alb. This molasse basin was filled with the debris of the rising Alps, under fresh water and partly under marine conditions. The Miocene Upper Marine Molasse formed a cliff coast line from southwest to northeast crossing the whole limestone area.Outside the marine development, the erosion of older soils and soil sediments was restricted through the rising sediment and groundwater level. Therefore in these places soils and soil sediments reflecting Tertiary and Holocene environmental development are partially preserved. The authors have been able to analyse such a sequence at Mergelstetten near Heidenheim. The sequence shows five separated periods of development. At the bottom are found limestones and dolomites of the Upper Jurassic as relicts of a strong karstic dissolution. The dissolution residue under tropical ferralitic soil development left a mineral assemblage of hematite, kaolinite and gibbsite behind. This sequence was in the depression later transformed through reductomorphic processes. The weathering under a strong loss of silica is reflecting the period earlier than 60 Million years B.P. Subsequently, under the environment of the Upper Marine Molasse a few kilometre south, the hollow was sedimented with clays and marls from the neighbouring hills. This has undergone a weathering in a depression of the landscape with reductomorphic stagnant features and a smectitic mineral assemblage. The next hiatus follows before the Kaiserstuhl volcanism, which is 20 Million years B.P. Then a sedimentation without very strong silicate weathering left behind carbonatic illitic materials. This after the Kaiserstuhl volcanic events from 17 Million years B.P. onwards showed a soil formation under strongly alkaline conditions within a swamp or gleyic environment. The main feature is the formation of thick columnar and pisolitic calcrete (limestone) reflecting this alkaline development under mild, mediterranean subtropical, environment. The main clay mineral which was probably formed with silica addition is smectite, but also a clear tendency of palygorskite formation can be observed. The youngest Tertiary period of the Pliocene is only ill documented. However, Pliocene and Holocene weathering in the first meter of the 10 meter deep profile show influence of alpine - derived dust deposition, the solution of limestone and the formation of a Chromic Cambisol again with smectitic mineralogy towards a Terra Fusca (Chromic Luvisol). This modem development showed a leaching environment which produced beside dominant illitic mixed layer and smectitic minerals also chlorite. The sequence is manifested through changes in the heavy mineral assemblage, in geochemical observations, in the carbonate petrography as well as with oxygen isotopy.",,

Wood'}]","The acid insoluble <2 mu m fraction of 36 clay-rich marls, each from a stratigraphically distinct bed, in the Turonian and Coniacian chalks of Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire has been analysed. All beds are dominated by smectite, with traces of illite and sporadic trace amounts of kaolinite. Major, trace and rare-earth element whole rock data show that the clay-rich beds fall into two groups. The majority have a relatively constant K2O/Al2O3 ratio (mean 0.12), low Zr/Al2O3 ratio (mean 0.002) and variable TiO2/Al2O3 ratio (mean 0.07); shale normalized rare-earth element (REE) data displays a negative Ce anomaly and a variable, gradual depletion in heavy REE. By analogy with clays in the German Chalk, these beds are considered to be detrital. Six beds (Barton 1, Melton Ross, Deepdale Lower, North Ormsby, Ulceby and Little Weighton 2) are characterized by a variable K2O/Al2O3 ratio (mean 0.05), relatively high Zr/Al2O3 ratio (mean 0.007) and low TiO2/Al2O3 ratios (mean 0.03). Shale normalized REE data typically displays a slight negative Ce anomaly and a variable, but commonly marked, negative Eu anomaly. By analogy with German examples, these beds are interpreted as bentonites derived from the in situ alteration of volcanic tephra.

The occurrence of mid Turonian to mid Coniacian bentonites in the Chalk of eastern England provides the first evidence that clay-rich beds in the English Chalk have more than one origin.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/91/A0/B2/91A0B2978818C919CDF50DAABCCFEEB5.pdf

A 200 m thick interval of the sequence has been sampled in order to date this platy dolomite. On the basis of facies, it has been divided into four intervals which are, from bottom to top: a) 50 m stromatolitic dolomite and limestones below the «platy dolomite», showing the sedimentological features of a restricted lagoonal environment in an inner carbonate platform. Among the microfossils, Sellialveolina viallii COLALONGO, Nezzazata simplex OMARA, Pseudolituonella reicheli MARIE, Biplanata pefieropliformis HAMAOUI & SAINT-MARC and Pseudorhapydionina dubia (DE CASTRO) are present. This fossil assemblage indicates an age ranging from the base of the Cenomanian up to the middle Cenomanian (DE CASTRO, 1991). b) 70 m thin-bedded dolomite and dolomitic limestones of which the typical platy dolomite facies constitutes 40 m in which sets of millimetre-scale laminae are frequently present and often contain terrestrial floral remains on the laminae surfaces. The fossiliferous horizon is ascribed to the middle-upper Cenomanian by the presence of Nezzazata simplex OMARA, Biconcava bentori HAMAOUI & SAINT-MARC, Biplanata peneroplifbrmis HAMAOUI & SAINT-MARC, Chrysatidina gradata D'ORBIGNY, Pseudorhapydionina dubia (DE CASTRO), Pseudorhapydionina laurinensis (DE CASTRO). The sedimentological features of the platy-dolomite and fossil flora content suggest deposition in a tidal flat under upper intertidal-supratidal conditions and, in particular, in an algal-marsh environment often exposed to dessication and storms, located close to a coastal area with primeval Angiosperms and Conifers. The first palaeontological studies on this continental flora, allow us to ascribe some fossils to Sapindopsis sp.. c) 42 m limestones and bioturbated dolomite which mark a drastic change in the environmental and sedimentological conditions on the carbonate platform, with heavily bioturbated biodetrital material (mainly fragments of Rudists), often in massive layers, proving a swift transition to deeper open marine conditions. In particular, the first 18 metres of this interval have many traces of Thalassinoid bioturbation. The tracks and burrows give an unmistakable appearance to the rocks and make this an important marker horizon in the whole ridge of Mount Chianello-Mount Vesole. Because of the presence in thin section of Dicyclina sp., Cisalveolina fraasi (GUMBEL) and Pseudorhipydionina casertana (DE CASTRO), a late Cenomanian age is assigned to this interval. d) 43 m of limestones and dolomite. The sedimentological features indicate an open carbonate platform environment often with coarse biodetrital elements and, in the upper part, a tendency to the emersion. This interval has been assigned to the Turonian by the presence of Murgeina apula (LUPERTO-SINNI), Biconcava bentori HAMAOUI & SAINT-MARL and small Moncharmontia apenninica (DE CASTRO). In conclusion, the above observations show that the sequence including the platy dolomite of Magliano Vetere, ranges in age from the Lower Cenomanian to the Turonian. The flora of the platy dolomite is Middle Cenomanian in age and reflects an upper intertidal-supratidal environment. The plant remains ascribed to the genus Sapindopsis constitute the first Italian finding of this type and fit well with a shallow marine environment close to a coast line. The studied sequence documents peritidal or paralic environments with a restricted water circulation in the Lower Cenomanian, with a strong tendency to stagnation in the Middle Cenomanian (platy dolomite). The restricted conditions change drastically in the Upper Cenomanian with its bioturbated rudist fragment-rich horizons.",,

The channel measures over 120 m in width and 20 m in depth. After an initial phase of sliding overall quiescence is marked by a burrowed surface. The overlying fill consists of intimately associated current and slide deposits. The former are characterized by climbing megaripples with set heights of 0.3-1.2 m, indicating suspension-rich currents. These megaripples mainly consist of foraminiferal sand washed out from Pliocene pelagic chalks and marls, mixed with some shallow-water benthos. The slide blocks display the lithology of the underlying Pliocene sediment and vary in size from a few cm to 15 m. Some blocks underwent deformation during sliding, whereas others retained their original shape. Comparison with data from analogous modern settings suggests that the channel was located at the transition between a relatively steep and more gentle submarine slope. Syntectonic deformation related to gradual uplift of Sumba probably induced locally steeper slopes on the distal part of a sediment-starved Miocene turbidite fan (which originally was inclined at an angle of around 2 degrees). The general slope during the Pliocene is estimated to have been less (1 degrees-1 degrees 30'). The origin of the megarippled foraminiferal sand-units is uncertain, but they may have been supplied by contour currents, presently shaping parts of the seafloor morphology in this region.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/2E/77/08/2E77087F4F587AB69BBD81EBC599BB58.pdf

Albian) Formations in the Danish Central Graben (North Sea) constitute one of the oldest chalk successions recorded globally, but have received little attention with regards to sedimentary facies and depositional processes. This study presents the first comprehensive carbonate facies analysis of the succession, retrieved from seven drill cores from the Valdemar and Adda Fields. A total of 50 facies are identi-fied, based on a continuum of six lithologies ranging from chalk to marlstone and tuffaceous siltstone to sandstone that display eight different sedimentary structures or fabrics, and two redox-associated lithological color variations (green and red) in the Adda Field. The eight sedimentary structures record: (i) comprehensive biotur-bation of homogeneous sediment during fully oxygenated benthic conditions and low sedimentation rates; (ii) a similar bioturbation process but in heterogeneous sediment with lithological contrasts permitting visible burrows to form, perhaps due to rhythmic alternation between pelagic (clay-poor) and hemipelagic (clay-rich) sedimentation; (iii) pelagic to hemipelagic suspension settling in dysoxic to anoxic bottom-water conditions; (iv) patchy cementation of the shallow sea bed during incipient hardground formation; (v) reworking of bioclasts and chalk intraclasts by bottom or wave-induced currents and cohesive debris flows; (vi) pressure solution during late burial diagenesis; (vii) shear deformation by intense plastic deformation of unlithified sediment from limited lateral displacement; and (viii) silicification during burial diagenesis. The facies distribution indicates that active tectonism took place prior to the onset of anoxia that resulted in deposition of the Munk Marl Bed, which in the Valdemar Field was followed by tectonic waning and repeated anoxia. The Valdemar Field constituted a basinal depocenter and was flanked to the east by an early inversion high in the Adda Field characterized by condensation and bypass. The Fischschiefer Member represents a return to prevailing anoxia, consistent with global records of the early Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (OAE-1a).",,

5f0ea8d29fced0a24be56d18,Impacts of low-speed vehicles on transportation infrastructure and safety,,[{'name': 'Sara Van Mechelen'}],"Introduction: Magnetic spherules have been reported from a large variety of geological environments (e.g., deep sea sediments, beach sands, aeolian sandstones, glaciogenic sediments, soils, or ice cores through geologic time). Their origin has long time been a matter of lively debate and various formation models have been proposed to date: extraterrestrial (cosmic), terrestrial impact, volcanic, sedimentary, biogenic, and anthropogenic-industrial; natural processes, such as forest wildfires or lightning, represent further mechanisms, e.g., [1]. Whereas some research claims magnetic spherules to be mainly of cosmic origin, others consider them to be mainly natural terrestrial objects or contaminations of anthropogenic origin. Sample location: Magnetic spherules have been discovered in sediments of two caves (~25 km away from each other) that are hosted by Upper Jurassic limestones and marls that build up the karstified plateau of the Schwäbische Alb, Southwest Germany. The caves formed during the Neogene; the possible depositional age of the cave sediments in both karst systems, as well as the age of the spherules, ranges from Miocene to Pleistocene (≥250 ka) [2]. For comparison, we investigated magnetic spherules selected from flue ash extracted from an ash filter of a cement plant. Morphological properties: Spherules from both caves, generally ~20-200 μm in size, exhibit various shapes (hollow and massive spherical to drop-shaped) and surface textures (smooth to microcrystalline spinifex-textured and coarser crystalline). Besides spherules that are perfectly ball-shaped and undamaged, they show signs of mechanical damage, highspeed particle contacts, and microcratering. Spherules of industrial origin basically exhibit the same surface properties. However, they do not show any evidence for high-speed particle contacts but strongly tend to assemble aggregates by fused point contacts (Fig. 1). Discussion and results: The internal microstructures and the general appearance of spherules derived from industrial processes are similar to those of cosmic particles. In many cases, it is almost impossible to distinguish between extraterrestrial (including impact) spherules and anthropogenic spherules by their geochemical composition. Characteristic marks of lowand high-speed particle contacts, respectively, may reveal a possible tool to discriminate between spherules of industrial (i.e., low-speed) and cosmic/impact (i.e., high-speed) origin. Whereas industrial magnetic spherules tend to form aggregates, spherules of cosmic and impact origin may be strongly fused and exhibit cratered surfaces (Fig. 2). A wide range of particle velocities must be considered for impacts on spherules; assigning precise velocities is difficult because the targets and/or projectiles are in various stages of cooling and solidification; the projectile velocities range from a few m/s (aggregate-forming processes) to several km/s in order to generate microcraters on the surface of the spherules, e.g., [4].

High-resolution biostratigraphy based on planktic foraminiferal bioevents across marker beds (i.e., organic-rich beds), allows revision of the lithostratigraphic subdivision and zonal scheme in comparison with late Albian time equivalents recorded in the northern Tethyan margins. In the present study, we proposed a new subdivision of the upper Albian lithostratigraphic section that now in-cludes the Mellegue horizon as an equivalent of the Amadeus Segment rhythmic marl/limestone interval (central Italy).

A gradual increase of trochospiral thick-walled (B. breggiensis, T. roberti, T. raynaudi) and Globigerinelloides taxa, reflecting mesotrophic conditions. 2) The Pseudothalmanninella subticinensis Interval Zone includes the first appearance of keeled forms (Ps.subticinensis), associated with abun-dant ticinellids with flattened chambers (B.breggiensis, T. roberti) below the base of the organic-rich Mellegue horizon, indicating an oligotrophic environment. 3) The Pseudothalmanninella ticinensis Interval Zone .The continuous occurrence of T.primula and the scarcity of Globigerinelloides throughout the lower part of this zone indicates an oligotrophic to weakly mesotrophic environment.

Turloughs have a dynamic flooding regime, are groundwater dependent and lack a surface outflow. The EU Habitats and Water Framework Directives provide the impetus for evaluating the impacts of nutrient pressures on this internationally protected habitat. Differences in hydrogeological settings are thought to be a key driver of nutrient variation among turloughs. An holistic assessment of turlough trophic conditions should include the terrestrial phase, and an improved understanding of turlough soil property spatial variation is necessary for informing attempts to link nutrient pressures and impacts on the terrestrial phase of the habitat. This study compared nutrient-related soil properties among two groups of turloughs situated in East Burren, Co. Clare, and Coole Garryland, Co. Galway. Each group is representative of a contrasting hydrogeological setting indicative of a trophic gradient. Soils within Coole Garryland turloughs are potentially more nutrient rich than East Burren turloughs owing to the larger zones of groundwater contribution with faster throughflow, greater levels of disturbance and more intense grazing pressures. Turloughs in East Burren had distinctly more alkaline and peaty soils than Coole Garryland, reflecting the relatively longer flood durations of the former. There was no clear distinction in soil total phosphorus, total nitrogen or desorbable phosphorus between East Burren and Coole Garryland. The soils of dry, more intensively grazed turloughs are apparently not more nutrient rich than wet, less intensively grazed turloughs. Variation in nutrient availability and inter-relationships of soil properties were examined along the flooding gradients of two turloughs representative of each hydrogeological setting, namely Garryland turlough and Cooloorta turlough. Elevated concentrations of available forms of N and P in the saturated lower zones of each turlough may be the result of anaerobic conditions or nutrient accumulation. High coefficients of variation reveal that available forms of N and P exhibit a high degree of spatial variation in turloughs. Consequently, the occurrence and distribution of vegetation communities and plant species indicative of different trophic conditions are likely to be more useful than soil nutrient assessments for assessing the impacts of nutrient pressures on turloughs. pH was identified as an important driver of P availability in turloughs. The negative association between available P and pH highlights the potentially significant influence of marl accumulation on turlough ecological functioning. Future turlough soil research should be cognisant of spatial variation along flooding gradients and should focus on N and P mineralisation studies of mineral, organic and calcareous soils to develop understanding of turlough nutrient cycling processes and retention capacities.",,
6230043a5aee126c0f9b580f,Flodfund - Bronzealderdeponeringer fra Gudenåen,,[{'name': 'Lise Frost'}],"River findsBronze Age metalwork from the river GudenåBronze Age metalwork (primarily swords and other weapons) found in European rivers has aroused interest for many years, but little is known of corresponding finds from Denmark. The general Scandinavian tradition of offering differs in that it is associated more with bogs and wetlands than with rivers. This article examines the relevant records from Denmark’s longest river, the Gudenå, and adjacent areas, dating from the Late Neolithic, Bronze Age and Early Pre-Roman Iron Age. Remarkably, it turns out that there are significantly more Bronze Age river finds from the Gudenå itself (38 in all) than was previously realised. Consequently, the Gudenå finds stand out relative to the Scandinavian votive tradition. This phenomenon forges links with the far-reaching European tradition of offering metal objects in rivers and new insights add depth and detail to the overall picture of offering traditions in southern Scandinavia and put these finds into a landscape-archaeological perspective.The Gudenå is Denmark’s longest river, with its total length of river including Randers Fjord being c. 160 km. (fig. 1). Given its width and depth, it is the only Danish watercourse to achieve the status of an actual river. The religious name ‘Gudenå’ is one of the oldest names associated with a Danish watercourse. The name ‘Guden’ is its original name, found in documentary sources extending back to the Early Middle Ages, and should probably be understood in the sense of ‘consecrated to the gods’. The precise age of the name is uncertain, but according to place-name researchers a large proportion of the old uncompounded names originate from the 1st millennium AD – and some are even older.A particular stretch of the Gudenå, extending for about 20 km from Tange through Bjerringbro to Ulstrup, has a remarkable concentration of river finds, and is especially striking between Tange and Bjerringbro (fig. 2). The finds from this section of river are surprising in terms of the number of Bronze Age artefacts, especially daggers and swords, represented among them. Chronologically, they cover the entire Bronze Age, but with an emphasis on the earliest part of the period. In general, the majority of South Scandinavian depositions date from the Late Bronze Age, with bogs and wetland areas being the sites most used for these. However, this picture is challenged by the evidence from the Gudenå which – due to relatively numerous finds from the Early Bronze Age and single finds of weapons and tools in water – differs fundamentally from the general picture. Furthermore, the finds from the Gudenå reflect a common European view that swords, daggers and spears were the primary objects associated with deposition in rivers.Chronologically, depositions from the Bronze Age (c. 1700 500 BC) constitute the primary focus of the study, but finds from the Late Neolithic (c. 2350 1700 BC) and Early Pre-Roman Iron Age (c. 500 200 BC) are also included (figs. 3a-d). The main emphasis is on the river finds. However, in geographical terms, not only actual river finds have been included, but also depositions recorded within a distance of c. 1 km from the river on both sides.This study encompasses a total of 112 finds: 38 river finds, 30 from fields/meadows, 27 from bogs and two from marl pits. Further to these are 15 finds for which there is no information on their find context (figs. 4 and 5).Various circumstances are important with respect to the representativity of the finds from around Tange, Bjerringbro and Ulstrup. One important explanation for the many records is linked to the construction of a large hydro-electric power plant at Tange in 1921. Huge volumes of earth were moved in its construction (fig. 6) and a good number of archaeological artefacts were found in the process. Another explanation relates to the activities of amateur archaeologists, especially Ulrik Balslev, who was particularly active in the area around Bjerringbro; no fewer than 15 of the finds in this study are from his collection (for example a Hallstatt sword, fig. 7). In recent years, the use of metal detectors has also had a significant effect with respect to the number of finds from the area.Figure 8 shows all the single finds dating from the Late Neolithic. The most frequent river finds are flint daggers and sickles, of which some of the latter may also date from the Early Bronze Age. An uncultivated area of bog at Ulstrup near the Gudenå yielded two special bronze axes. These have flared edges and they show great similarity to Anglo-Irish ornamented bronze axes of the time (fig. 9). They are not identical in either decoration or form, but they must originally have belonged together, constituting a collective deposition.In the Early Bronze Age, metal daggers are a prominent artefact group and, seen in the light of river finds of flint daggers from the Late Neolithic, they demonstrate a continuity of dagger deposition in certain parts of the Gudenå (figs. 10 and 11). A Fårdrup type axe was also found in the Gudenå (fig. 12).In the Late Bronze Age there is a general increase in depositions in southern Scandinavia, culminating in period V (c. 900 700 BC). This general picture differs slightly from that of the Gudenå’s river finds, which reveals a preponderance of finds dating from the Early Bronze Age. Figure 13 shows the finds distribution for the Late Bronze Age. As can be seen, swords feature among the river-found artefacts and the more unusual of these include an example of each of the two rare, imported Hallstatt sword types, of which only six have been found to date in Denmark.Figures 8, 10 and 13 show, respectively, the distribution of single finds from the Late Neolithic and the Early and Late Bronze Age. If the figures are compared, it becomes clear that there are slightly different finds distributions with respect to bog, field and river finds. For example, the river finds include a number of flint daggers, and the metal daggers of the Early Bronze Age come exclusively from the river. The swords and spears of the Early Bronze Age also include a number of river finds, whereas an artefact group such as the celts occurs more in field and bog finds than as river finds. Even though their total number is not very great, a similar situation is evident with respect to the Early Bronze Age flanged axes. In general, it can be said that these single depositions are dominated by artefacts from the male sphere.The only Pre-Roman Iron Age finds recorded from the Gudenå in the finds-rich area around Bjerringbro are a bronze double-spiral fibula and a ring, and with these the river finds also come more or less to an end. There are though scattered finds of much later date associated with the river – including a Viking Age sword from the Randers area and a 16th century battle sword. These later finds underline the river’s continued significance as a locality for depositions further up in time and the remarkable continuity evident in the ancient votive traditions.In a Danish context, the Gudenå stands out by being the country’s longest watercourse and by having a name that indicates a special significance. There are also scattered records of swords from other Danish watercourses, such as the Early Bronze Age period III example from Nørreå and a sword blade from period I found in Odense Å, but the finds from the Gudenå stand out by virtue of the striking concentration seen around Tange, Bjerringbro and Ulstrup. This section apparently had a special significance in a depositional context, whereby the river, partly by virtue of its size, invited the deposition of weapons in open water. If it is assumed that the distribution of finds largely reflects a prehistoric reality, it was along specific stretches of the Gudenå that people showed a particular predilection for deposition in water. This seems plausible as there were presumably considerable regional and local variations in depositional tradition during the Bronze Age – bound up to a very great extent with various local landscape features. In this respect, the variation shown by the Gudenå along its course is important. Specific sections could therefore very well have been chosen as a particularly suitable depositional landscape on the basis of special natural criteria. In the area around Tange and Bjerringbro, the Gudenå runs through a pronounced valley, flanked by terraces, which fixes the river solidly in the landscape and this could have been significant with respect to the intensity of deposition seen here. The distribution of finds is also totally consistent with a clear tendency, in a European context, for depositions not to occur in all parts of a river or everywhere across a wetland area, but to be associated with particular zones or stretches.A characteristic feature of several of the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age finds from the Gudenå is that they turned up at the confluence of two watercourses (fig. 14). In a European perspective, many river finds are also typically associated with fords, bridges and crossings and several Danish examples have similar find contexts. A number of finds from the Gudenå are associated with presumed crossings although, in several cases, this categorisation is based solely on the place name for the find relating to a bridge or ford, for example Lysbro (fig. 15).The various find situations and characteristics relating to the choice of deposition site can either be assessed very locally, whereby each individual find site is examined in relation to water, crossings etc., or they can be evaluated collectively, as elements in the landscape at a greater geographic scale and, thereby, as components of a ritual landscape which may have existed over a longer period of time. The Tange, Bjerringbro and Ulstrup section of the river has both a concentration of river finds and also records from river-near areas of artefacts discovered in bogs and wetland areas. An appraisal of the natural environment along this stretch reveals a characteristic feature: The river runs through a distinctive valley flanked by terraces. Given the nature and distribution of the finds and the morphology of the landscape, the term ‘Heilig Tal’ can therefore be applied to the Tange, Bjerringbro and Ulstrup section of the Gudenå river valley. It is beyond the scope of this article to address grave and settlement remains associated with the river, but in the light of the concentration of finds and the area’s characteristic natural environment, it is interesting that it is generally rich archaeologically with several finds from the Late Bronze Age – including grave finds from some the area’s numerous barrows (fig. 16).The Gudenå finds stand out from the Scandinavian votive tradition as exemplified by the river finds of daggers. And while these finds display clear points of similarity with the river finds associated with the European tradition, there are also differences, because the relatively numerous Early Bronze Age artefacts from the Gudenå also confer a special individual character on the finds. In any case, the Bronze Age finds from the Gudenå provide an interesting example of how special depositional traditions can arise in particular areas, while otherwise only making a very slight impact in other places within the Nordic Bronze Age culture.Lise FrostMoesgaard Museum",,

With the exception of calcretes, most limestones have < 5% cement, delta(13)C and delta(18)O values from 0 to +1.5 parts per thousand, and preserved Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios that indicate that neomorphism occurred in seawater rather than meteoric or evolved pore waters, Marine diagenesis of the limestones was facilitated by their slow accumulation rates, which were ca, 15 mm/ky based on Sr-isotope stratigraphy, relatively fine grain size, and high porosities which locally reach 50%. The Sr and Mg contents of grainstones are significantly lower than in the original sediments, whereas a less porous marl has higher Sr and Mg contents, The grainstones have about 300 ppm Sr and 6000 ppm Mg, consistent with slow abiotic precipitation of calcite under near equilibrium conditions with seawater, which is the thermodynamic drive for this diagenesis, The higher Sr and Mg content of the marl results from variable preservation of original allochems of biotic calcite. The results from this study and others on modern coal-water carbonates indicate that the extent of diagenesis varies with lithology, but much neomorphism occurred in seawater, with minimal effects from meteoric waters. As such, the chemical characteristics of seawater mag be effectively preserved in some ancient coal-water carbonates.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/02/8E/52/028E52437FBCEA46CDA04D8A3DD1467C.pdf

The operations were done by the same surgeon and by the same procedure (i.e; onlay tension free polypropylene mesh with two points fixation). Data regarding relevant patients with big ventral incision hernia with (onlaymesh repair) in Basrah teaching hospital and private hospital were revised. The presenting condition, hernia description, associated systemic and local factors, procedure of repair and follow up duration were all taken in consideration. Possible complications like; hematoma, seroma, wound infection, intestinal obstruction and enterocutaneous fistula were recorded and discussed once they occurred. The follow up period ranged from 4 to 21 months. Forty six patients were included in the study: 20 females and 26 males with median age of 50.5 year (range 35-68 year). Eleven patients (23.91%) were overweight and had body mass index ""BMI"" equal to more than 30, four patients (8.69%) had controlled diabetes mellitus, five (10.86%) had controlled hypertension and two (4.34%) suffered from chronic obstructive air way disease, there were eleven smokers (23.91%). Sixteen patients made regular visits that extended up to 12 months, 12 patients made regular visits up to 6 months, one made regular visits up to 18 month mainly due to partial intestinal obstruction., one patient was followed-up to 17 month because of multiple wound sinuses while 8 patients made irregular visits up to 21 month due to causes other than the hernia, eight patients lost from follow-up after 4 months. The original operation was bowel related in 18 cases, gynecological in twelve, hepatopancreatobiliary in 10, repair of paraumbalical hernia in six patients. The old incisions were long midline in 23 cases, paramedian in 17 and transverse in six patients. The main postoperative complications were seroma formation (13.04 %), wound haematoma (6.52 %), wound infection (4.34 %). no recurrence of hernia and no enterocutanous fistula were reported during our follow-up period. In conclusion, tension free onlay mesh repair is a feasible operative procedure for repair of large incision hernia with no significant major morbidity. Introduction ncision hernia remains a frequent complication of abdominal surgery with a reported incidence of 2 to 20% 1-3 . In the United States, 4 to 5 million laparotomies are performed annually 4,5 , which means that at around 400,000 to 500,000 incision hernias can be expected to develop each year. Approximately I Outcome of large incisional hernia repair with polypropylene mesh S.Kadum, N.Mahfooz, M.Hawaz & S.Taha Bas J Surg, March, 15, 2009 9 200,000 Incision hernia repairs are performed per year 6,7 . The incidence depends on a number of factors which are either general like old age, obesity, associated systemic disease or local factors like bowel surgery, suture material, chest infection, abdominal distension and wound infection, Ninety percent of incision hernias occur within 3 years of operation 8 . When morbidity is added to the vast numbers and the tremendous costs associated with incision hernia repair it becomes clear that the efficacy of incision hernia repair is of major importance. Unfortunately results of incision hernia repair are disappointing 9 . Suture repair of incision hernia results in recurrence rates of 12% to 54% 10-11 , while mesh repair results in recurrence rates of 2 to 36% 12,13 , and because most studies only provide short term followup, these recurrence rates may even be underestimated 14,15 . In addition to the high recurrence rates, incision hernia repair may give rise to serious complications, like enterocutaneous fistula and bowel obstruction, causing deterioration rather than improvement of the patient’s situation 16,17 . Numerous methods of repair have been described includes; primary repair in one or two layers, Mayo-type overlap, use of fascia (local or flaps) with suture darns and the use of fascia with synthetic mesh (polypropylene or marled, stainless steel, mersilene or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene mesh) 9-11 . Many operative techniques with prosthetic materials have been described on the basis of the anatomic positioning of the prosthesis (subcutaneous, sub-aponeurotic, preperitoneal and intra-peritoneal) 11,12 . The types and severity of complications associated with incision hernia mesh repair are related in part to the type of operative technique 13,14 . The subcutaneous technique is associated with high incidence of wound seromas, infections and recurrence rate 14,16 . Subaponeurotic and preperitoneal approaches are associated with a low rate of short and long term complications and are considered the best methods for repair 17-19 . The intraperitoneal approach is associated with a very low rate of general complications and recurrance due to deep placement of mesh and no need for dissection in the planes of deep layers of the abdominal wall 20,21 but there is fear of the serious complications that are enterocutanous fistula and intestinal obstruction, where the mesh come in contact with the bowel, every effort should made to prevent this direct contact by using peritoneum or omentum to separate bowel from mesh 22,23 . A recent report by Jacbus W.A. et al showed that the incidence of these complications was very low 24 . Steyerbery EW et al., on the other hand reported no such complications in their series (Intraperitoneal polypropylene mesh) 25 . In case of huge incision hernia with longstanding adhesions between bowel and the hernial sac, (where the sac is excised completely and the abdominal wall defect can not be closed without tension or there is no sufficient peritoneum or omentum to separate the bowel from mesh), the mesh completes the abdominal wall defect and comes in direct contact with the bowel, here it is preferable to choose a mesh type with minimal tendency to react with the bowel like expanded polytetrafluoroethylene mesh 26 . This study aimed to evaluate the outcome of large incisional hernia mesh repair with tension free onlay procedure, where the hernial defect can not be closed because of tension and there were no sufficient peritoneum or omentum to separate the bowel from polypropylene mesh. Outcome of large incisional hernia repair with polypropylene mesh S.Kadum, N.Mahfooz, M.Hawaz & S.Taha Bas J Surg, March, 15, 2009 01 Patients and method Patients data sources from the private clinic and Basrah Teaching Hospital traditional file recording system were analysed for all patients with large incision hernias mesh repair (ie; 10cm and more with tension free onlay procedure) for the period between January 1997 to December 2004; Fiftyeight patients have been found, proforma for each case is completed depending on the previously recorded information, all operations were done as an elective procedure by the same surgeon and by the same technique, 12 of them had follow-up of less than 2 months and excluded from the study ,the remaining 46 patients were included in this study had dependable follow-up (ranged from 4-21 month with median follow-up of 12 month). Operative technique: All patients received anti-thrombotic prophylaxis in the form of subcutaneous heparin (5000 iu bid/subcutaneously) that was started twelve hours before operation and continued until discharge from hospital. All patients received prophylactic antibiotic (Ampiclox 50 mg/kg i n 3 divided doses ,first dose started at the time of induction of anesthesia and then at six hours interval, cephalosporine used instead of ampiclox in cases of allergy to penicillin), All operations were performed under general anesthesia. After skin preparation and draping the cutanous scar was excised and the hernia sac dissected to expose the fascial defect. The sac was opened and the contents of hernia reduced after release of adhesions. In all cases the hernial sac was excised completely due to longstanding adhesions between bowel and the hernial sac and the abdominal wall defect can not be closed without tension and there was no sufficient peritoneum or omentum to separate the bowel from mesh. Mesh dimensions are calculated so that it exceeds the defect dimension by about 4cm all around margins. Technique is an onlay tension free, with 2 points of fixations, 1 st point fixing mesh to the margin of the defect by continuous prolene sutures, 2 nd point fixating the periphery of mesh into exterior of anterior rectus sheath by interrupted sutures, (fig.1). Two large size suction drains put in the subcutaneous space and removed within 24-72hrs or when less than 30 ml of fluid in the 2 suction drains after 24 hours. The hospital stay was ranged from 4–12 day. On discharge the follow-up instructions for each patient included instructions to visit the out-patient or private clinic regularly. First visit was after 3 days from discharge, then after 2 weeks; monthly for 2 months; every 2 months for 6 months; every 6 months for 2 years and scheduled up to 5 years. Results The total studied number was 46 patients, 20 females and 26 males with median age was 49.5 year for female (range 37-62 year) and 51.5 year for male (range 35-68 year). Eleven patients (23.91%) weighed more than their ideal body weight and had body mass index ""BMI"" equal to more than 30. Four patients (8.69%) had controlled diabetes mellitus, five (10.86%) had controlled hypertension. Two (4.34%) suffered from chronic obstructive air way disease. There were eleven",,

The late Miocene to early Pliocene interval preceding this progradation was characterised in northern Taranaki Basin by the accumulation of hemipelagic mudstone (Manganui Formation), volcaniclastic sediments (Mohakatino Formation), and marl (Ariki Formation), all at bathyal depths. The Manganui Formation has generally featureless wireline log signatures and moderate to low amplitude seismic reflection characteristics. Mohakatino Formation is characterised by a sharp decrease in the GR log value at its base, a blocky GR log motif reflecting sandstone packets, and erratic resistivity logs. Seismic profiles show bold laterally continuous reflectors. The Ariki Formation has a distinctive barrel-shaped to blocky GR log motif. This signature is mirrored by the SP log and often by an increase in resistivity values through this interval. The Ariki Formation comprises (calcareous) marl made up of abundant planktic foraminifera, is 109 m thick in Ariki-1, and accumulated over parts of the Western Stable Platform and beneath the fill of the Northern Graben. It indicates condensed sedimentation reflecting the distance of the northern region from the contemporary continental margin to the south. The latest Miocene (Kapitean) age of Ariki Formation beneath the Northern Graben gives a maximum age for the start of crustal extension in the basin; a minimum early Pliocene (Opoitian) age is provided by the age of the base of the Mangaa Formation, which infills part of the graben. Uplift on the margins of the graben allowed condensed Ariki Formation to continue to accumulate into the Waipipian. The Mangaa Formation has blocky to tabular profiles on SP and resistivity logs, particularly in Mangaa-1. The formation comprises several sandstone-dominated submarine fan deposits that thicken into the master graben fault. Accumulation of the Mangaa Formation within the graben continued into the Waipipian when it was supplanted by the bottom-sets of the Giant Foresets Formation. It was not until the latest Pliocene (Nukumaruan) that sedimentation rates exceeded subsidence rates in the graben, leading to progradation of the Giant Foresets Formation over the Western Stable Platform in northern Taranaki Basin.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/F8/08/C7/F808C7A0067A506B925EA9A47FDFAD41.pdf

This has allowed the development of a readily applicable bed numbering scheme and detailed faunal (macrofossil, foraminifera and ostracod) range charts. The Barremian-Aptian boundary is marked by the appearance of abundant examples of the ammonite Prodeshayesites and a marked lithological change from black shale to sandy mudstone. Higher parts of the Aptian have yielded abundant faunas, including ammonites of the fissicostatus, forbesi and deshayesi zones; the base of the forbesi Zone marked by the incoming of Ewaldi Marl facies. Poorly fossiliferous silty shales of the Albian tardefurcata Zone are succeeded by a bed with glauconite and phosphate pebbles, interpreted as marking the base of the mammillatum Superzone. This is overlain by fossiliferous clays of the Lower Albian and part of the Middle Albian. Range charts for macrofossils and microfossils from the Upper Barremian to Middle Albian of Speeton are constructed and biozones indicated. Aptian and Lower Albian successions inland of Speeton are highly variable, probably due to intra mid-Cretaceous fault movements.

In the Ankara region, one of the areas where the various phases of deformation and related structures are particularly well-preserved and exposed is the Edige (Elmadag) area, 48 km east-southeast of the city of Ankara. The youngest palaeotectonic unit in the AFITFZ, and deformed in the last phase of the palaeotectonic period (the Ankara orogenic phase) is the Edige formation. It consists of a fluvio-lacustrine sedimentary sequence mainly comprising basal conglomerate, shale, marl and a clayey limestone alternation dated as Turolian (MN 11) (Late Tortonian-Early Pliocene), based on its rich mammalian fossil content. The Edige formation was deposited within an extensional tectonic regime characterized by an oblique-slip normal faulting, in which the localized extension prevailed in approximately WNW-ESE direction. This first phase of extension was later replaced by a contractional tectonic regime and related successive and short- term phases of deformation such as folding, thrust to reverse faulting and finally strike-slip faulting which interrupted sedimentation of the Edige formation and deformed it. Both the stereographic plots of poles to bedding planes and the palaeostress analyses of slip-plane data recorded in the Edige formation and along its margin-boundary faults indicate that maximum horizontal stress operated in NW-SE direction during the phase of contraction. Finally, this last contractional tectonic regime (Ankara Orogenic Phase) was replaced by a strike-slip neotectonic regime. This is evidenced by an angular unconformity, which separates the underlying intensely deformed older rock assemblages including also the Turolian Edige formation from the overlying undeformed (nearly flat-lying) Edigekoru formation of Plio-Quaternary age. The strike-slip neotectonic regime in the Edige area initiated in Late Pliocene, has continued since that time under the control of active strike-slip faulting caused by a horizontal approximately N-S compression. This is indicated by three sets of approximately N-S strike-slip faults, namely the Elmadag, Kiliclar and Hisarkoy fault sets in the study area, which comprise northeastern continuations of the Elmadag, Balaban and Kuredag strike-slip fault zones, their activity proved recently by both the 2005.07.31, Mw = 5.2 Bala earthquake, and local concentration of numerous small earthquakes epicentres along their northeastern extensions, i.e., along the Elmadag, Kiliclar and Hisarkoy fault sets.",,

Four lithofacies are identified in the Shublik Formation: nonglauconitic sandstone--thin- to medium-bedded, fine, quartzose, calcareous to noncalcareous sandstone or silty to muddy sandstone, fossiliferous in places; glauconitic--thin- to medium-bedded, fine, quartzose sandstone, muddy sandstone, or siltstone containing 10% to > 50% glauconite grains phosphatic--thin- to medium-bedded siltstone or sandstone or laminated, black silty limestone or limestone containing phosphate nodules; and organic-rich--laminated, black limestone, marl, and mudstone. The organic carbon content of the organic-rich facies is as high as 5.45 wt %, despite the fact that the rocks are overmature and have generated oil. The mean P content of the phosphatic facies is as high as 14 wt % elemental P. Ichnofabrics are related to lithofacies and consistent with interpreted oxygen levels. Ichnofabrics also provide evidence of fluctuating oxygen levels within the facies, especially the nonglauconitic sandstone and glauconitic facies. The organic-rich facies and, to a lesser extent, the phosphatic facies contain abundant, pristine, disarticulated shells of the clam Halobia. The facies, geochemistry, ichnofabrics, and taphonomy are interpreted to be related to onshore-offshore gradients in biologic productivity and redox conditions. The facies array in the Shublik Formation is more similar to that in modern upwelling zones than facies arrays in other well-studied upwelling deposits. The Shublik Formation is interpreted as an upwelling-zone deposit and can serve as an archetype of such deposits.",,

Field and petrographic observations, and the distribution of planktonic foraminifera suggest that the bed formed from a complex sequence of events. A bolide impact nearby produced microtektites that settled to form a nearly pure layer at the base. Vaporized materials with anomalously high extraterrestrial components settled last, along with carbonate sediments. The entire bed became sparsely consolidated. Subsequently, another major disruptive event, perhaps a giant tsunami, partly reworked the initial deposit.

The depositional area was a distally steepened carbonate ramp which extended from Catalonia northwestwards to the Basque country. The investigated sediments range from calciturbidites and pelagic marls to marl-limestone alternations deposited on a distal carbonate ramp. Shallow marine limestones, marls and intertidal clastics and carbonates were deposited on the proximal part of the carbonate ramp. The establishment of a regional sequence analysis is based on the investigation of seismic profiles, well logs and outcrop sections. Examples of outcrop sections are interpreted in terms of sequence stratigraphy (unconformities of third- and second-order cycles, depositional geometries, systems tracts). The sequence stratigraphic interpretation of outcrop sections is based on facies analysis, interpretation of observed depositional geometries and correlation of unconformities and marine flooding surfaces through the basin. A biostratigraphic framework is established based on ammonites, inoceramids, planktonic and benthic foraminifera. As a result, a regional sequence stratigraphic cycle chart is presented and compared with published global cycle charts. The correlation of the regional cycle chart with published cycle charts is good. In the Cenomanian and Turonian, several sequence boundaries in the BCB are shifted by up to one biozone compared with the global chart. Some type 1 boundaries of the standard chart are only type 2 in the BCB. Important type 1 boundaries in the BCB are: top Geslinianum Zone with a 100 m lowstand wedge at the basis of the sequence (sequence boundary 92.2) ; base Petrocoriense Zone with a 250 m shallowing-upwards lowstand wedge at the basis (sequence boundary 89.2); and within the Syrtale Zone (sequence boundary 85.0).The Campanian-Maastrichtian sequence record is strongly disturbed by local compressive tectonics. Several sequences are recognizable and can be correlated with the global cycle chart. Correlation is hampered by the low biostratigraphic resolution in the western basin part. Subsidence analysis of several sections of the Upper Cretaceous of the BCB and its interpretation in the regional tectonic context leads to a discussion of the causes of the observed cyclicity. A regional eustatic curve is presented for the Upper Cretaceous of the BCB. Stage and substage names were used according Code-Committee (1977).",,

In the course of many centuries it changed owners and underwent numerous alterations and upgrades. The castle is structured around the late Gothic tower and palace, surrounded by the early 16th century Renaissance ring of defense in the form of a horse-shoe, comprising four towers. Historical sources mention Veliki Tabor for the first time in 1502, that is, we find it in the documents which accompanied Ivanis Korvin's donation of the castle to the noble family Rattkay. However, the original builders of the tower and the palace remain unknown. Fortresses appeared on the Croatian territory in the 13th and 14 century. Land Archaeology Department of the Croatian Conservation Institute conducted archaeological research in the tower "" C"" ground floor in the summer of 2009, and the works were financed by the Ministry of Culture as a part of the project that envisaged several years of conservation and restoration work on it. Archeological excavations in the interior of the tower "" C"" ground floor, in terms of the layout, the smallest of the four towers, were aimed at its western and eastern part all the way to the level of the sterile humus layer of marl, while its central part remained only superficially explored for static security reasons. Excavations in the eastern part led to the discovery of a layer of baked earth, originating from the structure defined as a fireplace. Radiocarbon analysis dated it to the period between the second half of the 13th and the end of the 14th century. South of the fireplace, remains of the former wooden palisade fence were found. Movable archaeological finds from tower ""C"" originate from the period between the late 14th and early 16th century. Although the excavated surface of the tower is small compared to the previously explored area of the Veliki Tabor castle, it seems that the research in the tower resulted in an array of new and interesting information. Most finds are fragments of coarse pottery intended for everyday use. Its forms, and the way they are decorated, belong to a common inventory of late medieval pottery. Also featured are more luxurious, imported specimens, such as the fragments of Spanish majolica and Celje style glasses. The finds include fragments of a ceramic pot with seals around the perimeter, belonging to Austrian ceramics. Other ceramic, metal and glass finds belong to the usual inventory of late medieval forts, old towns and also villages. Fragments of simple bowl-shaped tiles, ceramic tiles, glass window panes, a bronze thimble for sewing, tile fittings, iron crossbow arrowheads and rifle ammunition provide interesting information about what a late medieval city looked like, but they also tell us about some activities that must have taken place there. A special find from tower ""C"" is the silver one-sided pfennig that was minted in Salzburg in 1508 for Leonhard von Keutschach (1495-1519). The treated material is closest to the analogies found in the Vrbovec burg. Numerous analogies come from the wider area of Slovenia, Serbia, Austria and Hungary. The luxurious life of the nobility of the time is signaled by the remains of delicacy sea shells and snail shells they feasted on. The layers these finds originate from probably entered the tower during its construction in the early 16th century, when former waste material was used for leveling.Most of the movable items should be placed in the 15th century which, as seen by numerous similarities between the archaeological finds, was marked by the great influence the Counts of Celje had on our region.",,

The delta C-13(organic) values are systematicallly ighter (mean = -21.0 +/- 0.82 parts per thousand) in all sapropels and heavier (mean = -18.8 +/- 1.07 parts per thousand) in the marl oozes. These differences are not due to variable marine and terrestrial organic matter mixtures because all values are heavier than modem plankton in the Mediterranean, there is no relationship between the C-organic/N ratios and the isotopic values, and published information on the abundance and distribution of organic biomarkers shows that terrestrial material constitutes a minor fraction of the total organic matter. Temperature effects on isotope fractionation are also discounted because the change in delta C-13(organic) values between glacial and interglacial horizons is in the opposite sense. Diagenesis, which can produce relatively small changeis in the carbon isotopic composition of sedimentary organic matter under certain circumstances, is unlikely to have caused the observed differences because this mechanism would cause an e enrichment C-12, implying that all values were even heavier originally, and there is no secular trend in the delta C-13(organic) record. The observed differences in delta C-13(organic) between the two lithologies are probably produced by changes in the isotopic composition and the concentration of dissolved CO2. First, freshwater flooding during the formation of the sapropels caused the isotopic composition of the dissolved in organic carbon in the surface waters of the Mediterranean to become lighter because of the C-13 deficiency in fresh waters. Hence photosynthesis would have produced isotopically lighter organic material. Second, changes in atmospheric pCO(2) between glacial and interglacial periods, as shown by the Vostok ice core, caused marked changes in the concentration of free ;dissolved CO2 in the mixed layer; lower values during glacial maxima caused a smaller fractionation of the carbon isotopes by phytoplankton, whereas levels were less limiting during the interglacials. Concentrations of dissolved CO2 could also have been much higher during the deposition of the sapropels cause of the supply of regenerated CO2 to the mixed layer by upwelling, and this could have further lightented the delta C-13(organic) values in he sapropels themselves. Carbon isotope records may provide an alternative method of or estimating atmospheric pCO(2) levels over longer time periods than can be obtained from ice cores.",,

The initial impetus for developing a new lithostratigraphy for the Chalk was, however, the need to provide a framework for major construction projects, particularly earthworks and tunnels, in relation to physical properties and rock mass character. Out of this research arose divisions appropriate for mapping because the geomorphology reflected the material and mass properties. Latterly, the detailed marker bed stratigraphy has successfully been employed to construct ground models for tunnels along the south coast and for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. The same detailed stratigraphy is also being used to develop a hydrogeological stratigraphy for the Chalk aquifer.The conspicuous 'stratigraphic' variation in the rock mass character of the Chalk reflects both lithological variation and tectonic controls. Understanding this variation and its causes makes the development of a mechanical or fracture stratigraphy possible. Such a fracture stratigraphy provides the means for modelling the Chalk as an aquifer, as an oil reservoir and aids prediction of ground conditions for slope, tunnel and earthwork design. Karst development in the Chalk is also closely related to its material and mass character, especially the lithostratigraphy and associated fracture styles.A key factor in the development of the detailed lithostratigraphy was the recognition of marker beds, including marl seams, flint bands and macrofossil and trace fossil horizons, that could be consistently recognised in rock-core as well as field sections. Training geologists and engineers to recognise these features has been an important part of the successful application of this geological research to a, vide range of industries.",,

The Suva Marl accumulated at an average rate of 83.2 m/m.y. and provides a unique opportunity to address the question of whether present-day overprints bias the transition records. Fiji has undergone a 30° counterclockwise rotation since the deposition of the Suva Marl and hence a present day overprint onto the transitions would bias the VGPs toward the east of the site. Replicate transition records yield VGPs over both Asia and the Americas. Progressive demagnetization reveals a normal polarity overprint which was acquired prior to the rotation of Fiji, and therefore does not produce an easterly bias to the transition data even after correction for the rotation. We collected an oriented block sample across a portion of the transitional interval in the upper Cochiti reversal. Subsampling of this block into 1.0 cm thick wafers cut parallel to bedding provides considerably greater detail during the transition.

The formulations for convenient calculation of the relative permeability data similar to the JBN method are provided and validated using the laboratory data obtained by the radial immiscible fluid displacement tests in horizontal porous disks. The applications demonstrate the capabilities of the present interpretation method. Introduction By-and-large, the present relative permeability determination methods have been developed for applications in the linear flow systems such as in the laboratory core plugs. However, determination of the relative permeability data from the injection and production well data requires a radial flow interpretation method. For this purpose, the convenient interpretation formulae elaborated and demonstrated by the authors (Tóth et al.[1–6]) previously for determination of relative permeability from unsteady-state two-phase linear fluid displacements in laboratory core tests under constant rate or pressure conditions are transformed for displacement in the radial distance around a well. Special formulae for laboratory simulation of such radial flow in circular disks of relatively small thickness are also derived for interpretation of laboratory data. The interpretation method developed in this paper is somewhat similar to the JBN method for displacement in core plugs but applicable for radial flow and also improved in accuracy by means of special straight-line plotting schemes. In contrast to the JBN method, however, the present method yields the relative permeability functions instead of calculating the point values of the relative permeability data. The new approach taken in this study is based on the theory of the displacement processes according to the Buckley-Leverett model and Darcy's law considering the variation in the cross-sectional area with the radial distance (Marle[7], Latil[8]) Parallel to the above-mentioned theoretical development, also the laboratory investigations of the radial flow systems have been carried out to derive and verify the relevant displacement relationships and to determine the relative permeability functions from the production data. The laboratory flow tests have been carried out using horizontal disks of typical sandstone samples in 4"" outer diameter sizes containing 0.5"" diameter holes in the center. The upper and lower flat surfaces of these disks have been coated with epoxy. The disk-shaped cores have been first saturated with oil. Then, the oil has been displaced by injecting or pumping water through the hole inside the disks to represent the flow condition around a well. The production data obtained under constant injection rate and constant pressure difference conditions have been measured accurately and used with the present interpretation formulae. The relative permeability curves have been constructed using such data and compared with each other. Fluid Displacement in Radial Systems Radial rock samples were prepared for investigations where the fluid is flowing from the mantle of the disk-shaped samples to a small diameter well drilled into the core center. The core is considered homogeneous. Its porosity is F and permeability is k. The height of the core sample is h, the radius of the axial well is rw, and the external radius is re. The core is saturated with a fluid denoted by a subscript k. Then, this pore fluid is displaced by another fluid denoted by a subscript d. Both fluids are assumed incompressible and immiscible with each other. The volumetric rate of the injected fluid is qi. The effect of the capillary forces is supposed to be negligible (Pc=0) during the displacement processes. The pressure at the mantle (fluid inlet face) is pe, the pressure inside the small diameter well (fluid outlet face) is pw. Thus, the pressure difference between the outer and inner faces of the disk is ?p = pe - pw (see Fig. 1). In this section, the theoretical foundations of the relative permeability determination from radial flow immiscible displacements are presented by extending the application of the Tóth et al.[1–6] approach.",,

 Carpathians, Slovakia). Its stratigraphic range is Bathonian to Callovian and it is one of the youngest known true stromatactis
 mud-mounds. The complete shape the mound is not visible since the klippe is a tectonic block encompassed by younger Cretaceous
 marls. The matrix is micritic to pelmicritic mudstone, wackestone to packstone with pelecypods, brachiopods, ammonites, and
 crinoids. An important component of the mound is stromatactis cavities that occur as low as the underlying Bajocian-Bathonian
 crinoidal limestones. The stromatactis cavities are filled by radiaxial fibrous calcite (RFC) as well as in some places by
 internal sediment and, finally, by clear blocky calcite. Some cavities remain open with empty voids in the centres. In some
 stromatactis cavities, tests of cavedwelling ostracodsPokornyopsis sp. were found, surrounded by the latest stages of the RFC. This indicates that stromatactis cavities formed an open network
 enabling migration of the ostracods and their larvae over a period of time.
 
 Except in the case of the stromatactis cavities, there are numerous examples of seeming recrystallizationsensu Black (1952) and Ross et al. (1975) and Bathurst (1977). The radiaxial fibrous calcite encloses patches of matrix and isolated
 allochems. The RFC crystals are oriented perpendicularly to the substrate whether it is a cavity wall or enclosed allochems.
 This means that the RFC crystals could not grow from the centre of the cavity outward as postulated by Ross et al. (1975).
 There are also numerous “floating” isolated allochems, which are much smaller than the surrounding RFC crystals. The explanation
 involving three-dimensional interconnection of allochems seems to be unlikely. In the discussed mud-mound there is a conflict
 between apparently empty cavities that had to exist in the sediment and seeming “recrystallization” related to the same RFC
 that forms the initial void filling. The authors favor an alternative explanation of the “recrystallization”. We presume that
 the allochems served as nucleation points on which the crystals started to grow. Obviously, the allochems and the micritic
 patches were different from the surrounding material. RFC crystals (either short-or long-bladed) of the “recrystallization”
 spar grew at the expense of decaying microbial mucillages. The mucus can enclose peloids, allochems, or whole micritic patches
 that “floated” in the cavity and served as nucleation sites for the RFC crystals. The entire mud-mound represents a microbially
 bound autochthonous micritic mass; the stromatactis and stromatactis-like cavities originated where purer mucillage patches
 occurred, giving rise to open spaces. Such features as the morphological variety of stromatactis fabrics, the pervasive penetration
 of the sparry calcite into matrix, and the enclosure of the “floated” allochems and mudstone patches by sparry calcite, seem
 to provide support for the presence of mucus aggregates within the mound body. The mucus might be related to protozoans rather
 than to sponges or other well organized metazoan organisms.
 
 
 
 Occurrence of the stromatactis cavities in the underlying Bajocian-Bathonian crinoidal limestones support the inference on
 biological origin of the stromatactis fabrics. The alternative inorganic models of stromatactis origin (e.g., internal erosion
 or water-escape) are hardly applicable to the sediment formed by crinoidal skeletal detritus.

The quartz-jadeitite blocks or lense show granoblastic texture in the centre and foliation at the margin. It is always keeping in fresh in the centre and gradually retrograded approaching to the margin of a block and finally becomes jadeite-bearing gneiss.

Coesite inclusions occur in both garnet and Jadeite in fresh quartz-jadeitite. The end member of Jadeite is calculated to be 81.25-90.27%. Geochemical features indicate that the protolith of these quartz-jadeitite to be greywacke, and the protolith of the associated eclogite in marble is reported to be marl. Therefore, the association of quartz-jadeitite, marble and eclogite should be supercrust rocks sequence.

Leg 207 is the first of the last group of 4 legs to be drilled by the ship JOIDES RESOLUTION. From January to March 2003 4 sites are being explored on the Demerara Rise on the Surinam Margin, Western Equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Water depths range from 1895 to 3215 metres. The sites have been imaged with high resolution, multichannel seismic lines supplemented by industry lines. Stratigraphic control is provided by Site 144 of the Deep Sea Drilling Project Leg 14, Shell well Demerara A2–1 and Paleogene cores from the METEOR cruise 49/4. Oozes, chalks and black shales from an expanded Cretaceous - Paleogene section at shallow burial depths are being investigated for stratigraphic boundaries and Oceanic Anoxic Events. These results will be of significance to deepwater exploration for hydrocarbons offshore Trinidad, Venezuela and the Guianas. Introduction The ODP is now in its final year of scientific exploration, with the drillship JOIDES Resolution completing Leg 207 on the Demerara Rise. Leg 207 continues the coring started in 1970 during DSDP Leg 14 at Site 144, at Shell well Demerara A2–1 and during the METEOR cruise 49/4. Drilling Sites Four sites on the submarine plateau were selected for drilling, located at 9 degrees North Latitude and 54 degrees West Longitude, Water depths range from 1895m at Site DR2 to 3215 m at Site DR3C. The targets were expanded Cretaceous to early Miocene marine sections at shallow burial depths. Jurassic sandstone is overlain by late Albian shales interbedded with claystones. The Cenomanian to Santonian sequence of laminated black shale with limestone stringers can be correlated with La Luna source rocks on land to the west and north. Campanian to Maastrichtian calcareous ooze and chalk are overlain by a complete Paloegene sequence of calcareous ooze and chalk. The late Neogene is absent. Seismic Control Seismic Stratigraphy of the Outer Demerara Rise indicates five reflectors:Reflector at base of Quaternary ooze and above Miocene strata.Reflector of late Oligocene to early Miocene age.Reflector above Santonion to Cenomanian black shale sequence.Reflector above Barremian to Albian marls and claystones.Reflector below Barremian-Albian claystones. Relationship to Trinidad Offshore Results from Leg 207 should indicate the age of the deepwater Oligocene-Miocene sediments offshore Trinidad and Venezuela, as well as Guyana. On the East Trinidad shelf, BHP encountered petroleum in Oligocene sands of the Matura Basin, indicating that Paleogene strata may extend into deepwater. Exploration wells in the deepwater Iere basin on the Atlantic margin offshore Trinidad's East coast penetrated thick Pleistocene - Pliocene strata. The first 6 wells drilled by Exxon, Shell and BP encountered reservoir quality sandstones, but the reservoir seal was degraded by unconsolidated formations, mud volcanoes and shallow gas.",,
53e9a07ab7602d9702960cab,"Deposits of Deflected and Ponded Turbidityents, Currents, Sorbas Basin, Southeast Spain",,[{'name': 'Peter D. W. Haughton (*)'}],"?Serravalian-Tortonian sediments of the Sorbas Basin, Southeast Spain, preserve an oblique slice through a narrow east-west-trending turbidite basin. Close to Lucainena, unusual ""composite"" sandstone sheets with thick mudstone caps can be traced obliquely away from the faulted southern margin of the trough in the vicinity of where north-to-south transverse paleoflows are replaced eastward by west-to-east axial flows. Three distinctive types of bed profile are recognized. Lateral correlations over distances up to 5 km establish that Types I, II, and III bed profiles are laterally equivalent and must have been emplaced together as part of the same event. Beds with Types I and Il profiles are present to the WSW, where they thin and pinch out toward the contact with the Alhamilla basement to the south. As beds are followed along strike to the ENE, they thicken and develop Type III profiles before thinning again and passing laterally into bioturbated marls. The structure and lateral relationships are thought to have been produced by deposition from turbidity currents derived from the north and northwest but deflected against a raised Alhamilla block and forced to flow eastward. The composite structure of the beds close to the Alhamilla basement is related to deceleration and subsequent collapse of flows that partly rode up the southern flank of the basin as they were turned to travel eastward down the basin axis. The thick mudstone caps represent fallout from a suspension cloud produced by axial ponding of the muddy tail of the deflected currents (suggesting that the basin was closed to the east); internal seiches set up by ponding of the flows may account for some of the features of Type II profiles.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/3B/CA/F9/3BCAF9FE2226B8BE6DD662E0106308D0.pdf

Both in Recent seas and in the ante-gypsum Messinian series, B. gr. lyrifera is one of the deepest spatangoids, living in deeper environments than those settled by Clypeaster and Schizaster.

Our high-resolution studies (chemical elements, 613C, 6180, calcareous nannofossils, planktic and benthic foraminifera) show that below the marl-clay transition there is a 40-50 cm thick interval (corresponding to 10-20 kyr) containing a detailed record of a gradual succession of faunal and geochemical events culminating in the benthic extinctions. Planktic foraminiferal and nannofossil changes (e.g., the onset of demise in Fasciculithus genus) occur a few meters below the marl-clay transition. In the limestone 50 cm below the base of the clay, a prominent glauconite maximum indicates that sea-floor oxygenation suddenly decreased. Glauconite continues to be common until the onset of clay deposition. A whole-rock negative 613C shift (1.6%0), most likely reflecting an original sea-water trend, is gradually developed over the 40 cm of greenish brown marls immediately below the clay. At the base of these marls there is a small, significant iridium anomaly of 133 ppt Ir compared with an average background of 38 ppt. In the marls the demise of the Fasciculithus species accelerates, Gavelinella beccariiformis becomes extinct, and the abundance of Acarinina species begins to increase. The superjacent 4 m of clay is devoid of original calcite in its lower part and has a low calcareous content higher up. At calcareous levels in the clay an unusual planktic foraminifera fauna occurs, dominated by Acarinina species. When marl deposition returns, 613C gradually increases and then stabilizes at values about 0.5%o lower than before the isotopic excursion. The 613C excursion spans in total 5 m, probably corresponding to 200-400 kyr. The fasciculiths disappear shortly after the stabilization of 613C. Here we also present a whole-rock 6~3C profile through the entire Paleocene section at Zumaya. The profile is very similar to previous profiles registered in well preserved deep-sea material, suggesting that whole-rock 613C at Zumaya can be used for correlation.",,

Complex facies relationships have been resolved by detailed logging of key sections over a 300 sq. km area and by biostratigraphic analysis. Mid and outer neritic marls and argillaceous limestones of the lower Gehannam Formation are overlain proximally by a major coastal sand body complex, the Birket Qarun Formation, which (as preserved) was deposited almost entirely on the lower shoreface. The sands of the Birket Qarun Formation prograded progressively northwards in four phases, with individual sand bodies separated by transgressive wedges of inner to mid-neritic silts and clays (the upper Gehannam Formation and the newly named Garet El-Naqb Formation). The final phase of progradation was terminated by the transgressive lower Qasr El-Sagha Formation. Calcareous nannofossil Zone NP17 (late Bartonian) is represented in the lowest Gehannam Formation. The Dictyococcites erbae nannofossil acme, previously recorded from Italy and ODP sites, has been identified at a higher level within the lower Gehannam Formation. Its start (in early NP18) is suggested as an excellent criterion to define the base of the Priabonian. Zone NP18 is highly condensed; sedimentation rates increased dramatically in early NP19/20 with the shift to predominantly clastic sedimentation. The Birket Qarun Formation is entirely within Zone NP19/20 (Priabonian). Seven depositional sequences are tentatively differentiated. Previous sedimentologic and paleogeographic interpretations are discussed; there is no evidence for 'bay' or otherwise restricted environments within this area, and previously proposed episodes of emersion are also discounted. Levels with relatively abundant marine mammals mainly reflect episodes of reduced clastic sedimentation, but are partly biased by differing surface exposure of successive intervals. There is no evidence that these levels represent whale 'calving grounds', or that marine mammals were unusually concentrated in this area in life.",,

This paper aims to understand the effect of topographic factors and lithology on forest cover distribution around Bin El Ouidane dam in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, using remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), field observation, and statistical analysis. The forest vegetation was quantified by calculating the Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) from Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. The NDVI was classified according to the density of forest vegetation into four levels: bare soil, low density of forest cover, moderate density of forest cover, and high density of forest cover. The correlation analysis between NDVI, interpreted as forest densities and topographic parameters (elevation, slope, and aspect), derived from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), showed that elevation has the most significant positive correlation with forest density, with r = 0.563 and a p-value less than 0.05. Additionally, moderate and high densities of forest vegetation are optimal in the terrain aspect of the South-East and North-West, respectively. However, the NDVI variation cannot be interpreted only by altitude and terrain aspect. The Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classification has been used to map and to separate the forest vegetation types. The statistical results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the altitude is the most important topographic factor affecting the distribution of forest species. The analysis of frequency histograms revealed that Holm oaks are increasing at high altitudes, and are more abundant in the North-West, while the Thuya species prefer moderate altitudes and are more abundant in the South-East-facing aspects. In our study area, the Holm oak develops on limestone formations. On the contrary, Thuya does not thrive in lithological conditions, and is found with a decreasing level of predominance on limestones, marls-limestones, and sandstones, respectively. The conclusion of the study shows that a combination of topographic factors and lithological conditions affects the spatial distribution of forest vegetation. The adaptation of the forest species to specific topography and lithological conditions should be considered for forest management. It can be helpful in selecting potential sites for reforestation of these species, for conservation of the natural resources, including water and soil.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/19/AA/5F/19AA5F04DFC78A0EAAC6049A42E60765.pdf

Porphyrins derived from degradation of chlorophylls are of particular interest because of the possibility of relating palaeoproductivity estimates from sediments to chlorophyll-based measurements of present-day productivity determined by remote sensing. But standard analytical methods do not detect all of the porphyrins present in a geological sample - a substantial fraction of the porphyrins may be bound to kerogen10,11 or to solvent-extractable macromolecules, or may be degraded by the oxidative extraction procedures. It has been shown recently12-16 that sulphur may play a crucial part in binding 'biomarker' molecules at an early stage of sediment diagenesis, and that desulphurization using Raney nickel may liberate small molecules bound to sulphur-containing species. Here we show that this approach releases large amounts of porphyrins from the total organic extract of a sulphur-rich marl.

Six QTLs and twenty-two pairs of epistatic loci for the four parameters were detected. Three QTLs detected for maximum adventitious root length in solution culture (MARLS), total root dry weight in both solution culture and paper culture (TRDWS and TRDWP) accounted for about 20%, 23% and 13% of the total variations, respectively. Only epistatic loci were found for maximum adventitious root length and adventitious root number in paper culture (MARLP and ARNP), and for ratio of root to shoot in both paper and solution culture (R/SP and R/SS), which accounted for about 12%-61% of the total variations in the parameters, respectively. No identical QTL or epistatic loci were found for the parameters in both solution and paper culture. The results indicate that there is a different genetic system responsible to root growth of rice seedlings under lowland and upland conditions and epistasis might be the major genetic basis for MARLP, ARNP, R/SP and R/SS.",,

Hobbs'}]","A short period (0.075-42 s) Magnetotellur ic (MT) survey was carried to investigate the geoelectric crustal structure of Sousaki geothermal area in Greece. The MT data were initially processed and analysed by Lagios (1992) and Tzanis and Lagios (1993). They suggested that the crustal structure below Sousaki, comprises a complex geoelectric domain of intersecting conductive fault zones and resistive blocks which may include igneous intrusions. Their results were based on one dimensional (1-D) MT models, and thus to determine such a complex structure at least two dimensional (2-D) modelling should be undertaken. This was the main task of the present study. An attempt to construct a three dimensional (3-D) model for this area was proved unsuccessful due to difficulties in the design of the actual model grid. The MT data were finally modelled using a 2-D forward modelling technique. The adopted 2-D MT model concerns the top 2 km of upper crust and provides a different structure with that derived by the 1-D models. This was attributed to the presence of regional 2-D or local 3-D structures. The 2-D model is consistent with the geology and tectonics of Sousaki. The low resistivities (2.5-5 ohm-m) observed within the uppermost 100 m seem to be compatible with the Plio-Pleistocene marls and volcanics. The very low resistivities (0.5-1 ohm-m) observed at greater depths (0.5-1.5 km) are probably related to hydrothermally altered ophiolites. The low resistivities observed in the area combined with the various superficial thermal manifestations, make up a significant evidence for the existence of a geothermal field. The three major fractured zones identified in this area are probably those which should allow the rainwater and the geothermal fluids to flow and ensure the hydraulic continuation of the Earth's surface with the top weathered zone of the limestone or ophiolitic basement.",,

Production is from the Thamama limestone reservoir at 11–13,000 ft. TVD. Reservoir pressure depletion is creating an ever increasing collapse pressure differential on casing opposite overlying sediments. Sajaa field has a history of collapsed casing on wells Sajaa 33 and 39, with two collapse events in the latter wellbore. The current study summarizes the theoretical effort to prevent collapse in the remaining Sajaa wells. A companion paper1 discusses the related live well workover program. Current Sajaa completions are packerless, producing up the tubing or up the annulus between the production casing and a capillary string for corrosion inhibition. Coincidentally, the collapse resistance of the production casing is reduced by severe wear associated with the use of tungsten carbide hard banding while drilling the reservoir sections of the wellbore. Setting the context for the study, the well(s) tubular program, pore and internal pressures, and design safety factors are presented. This introductory portion also clarifies the differential collapse load to which the tubulars are subjected. Loss of collapse resistance due to severe wear is then addressed. The theory of wear prediction is reviewed, and then demonstrated, as the drilling parameters of several of the affected wells are used to predict their current state. These predictions are then compared to mechanical caliper measurements taken during intervention and repair. Further, using specially machined wear grooves, the effect of wear on collapse of a casing cross section is experimentally validated by full scale collapse tests. Results of both the wear prediction/measurement and its effect of collapse resistance are input to a probabilistic decision tree to tailor each well's workover strategy. The decision tree permits risk-weighting of alternate strategies for repairing the Sajaa casing. An important component of the decision tree is the consideration for time varying alteration of the collapse differential pressure with reservoir depletion. Introduction The Sajaa gas/condensate field is located in the Emirate of Sharjah, UAE. The Thamama reservoir is at depth 11,000 ft., at temperature 300°F, and possessed an initial reservoir pressure of 8000 psi. A typical wellbore design (Fig. 1) targets the Nahr Umr to be top set with 9–5/8 in. 53.5 lbf/ft L-80 casing. This is accomplished by drilling through the Padbdeh clays, Aruma and Lower Aruma, the Aruma formation requiring 14 ppg fluid densities. The Aruma consists of marls, limestones, claystones and siltstones, and is the pressure bearing formation creating high collapse differentials across the production casing. The top of the 7 in. production liner is typically chosen above the Nahr Umr shale which extends 450 ft. above the top of the Thamama, the base of the 7 in. liner depending on the well (horizontal, sidetrack). The Nahr Umr is a high quality seal.",,

The c. 450 m-thick succession dips gently eastwards in a series of long, continuous sections that are separated from one another by minor faults which, with one exception, do not cut out any of the succession. At Seaton about 50 m of strata occur within a complexly faulted zone in which fault-bounded fragments of the succession cannot be readily correlated with the main outcrop. The availability of a continuous core from a nearby borehole has enabled the sequence in the faulted section to be pieced together for the first time, and to provide a complete stratigraphy for the group. The previously un-named lower part of the Mercia Mudstone Group (the beds below the Blue Anchor Formation) exposed in the Devon coastal sections can be divided into three formations and nine members based on gross lithology. The lowest and highest of these formations consist of relatively monotonous red mudstones for which the names Sidmouth Mudstone and Branscombe Mudstone are proposed. The middle formation, for which the name Dunscombe Mudstone is proposed, consists of a 35 m-thick sequence of laminated green, purple and grey mudstones which expands in some inland successions proved in boreholes to over 100 m by the addition of thick beds of salt. The lithologies exposed in the coastal sections can be correlated with the geophysical-log signatures of the Mercia Mudstone Group successions proved in inland boreholes throughout the Wessex Basin.",,

Under different environmental conditions (burial depth, in situ temperature, host-rock fades) of the upper slope to lower rise, conversion of biogenous opal-A to opal-CT took place in biosiliceous chalks and marls older than early middle Eocene. Dense sampling revealed the sharp character of the diagenetic silicification front (seismic reflector A), which demonstrates a widespread, more or less synchronous (51-53 Ma), rapid change of silicoplankton fertility and preservation, which later led to the marked boundary between an opal-A and an opal-CT diagenetic facies. In clay-rich sediments on the lower rise (Site 603), the opal-A opal-CT transformation is largely retarded, whereas clinoptilolite formation is enhanced. Host-rock composition and the, consequent interstitial water chemistry, apparently controlled by palaoclimatology and paleoceanography, appear to be the most important factors influencing the rate and mode of silica diagenesis. Diagenetic alteration of the primary siliceous oozes to porcellanitic chalks and porcellanites took place only in a narrow equilibrium range of the complex geochemical sediment-pore water system. These ideal conditions were realized in our case and at most sites in the Atlantic Ocean in sediments older that 51 m.y. INTRODUCTION Middle to lower Eocene siliceous sediments (Bermuda Rise Formation) were penetrated at four of the DSDP sites of Legs 93 and 95 (603, 605; 612 and 613, respectively) drilled on the New Jersey Transect between the lowermost continental rise and the upper slope (Fig. 1). The diagenetic transition of biogenic opal-A to opal-CT (porcellanite) can be studied at different conditions of burial depth, temperature, and geochemical environment. Parallel analyses of sediment geochemistry and clay mineralogy (Thein and Scháfer, in prep.) and physical rock properties (Wilkens et al., this volume) help to elucidate the conditions under which the formation of porcellanite, chert, and zeolites took place in the Atlantic Ocean in sediments older that 51 Ma, and to study the paleoenvironmental framework that influenced this diagenetic path. Site 603 (Fig. 2) was drilled on the outermost continental rise off Cape Hatteras at a water depth of 4633 m and shows, below a hiatal boundary covered by mid-Miocene sediments, a lower mid-Eocene to upper Paleocene sequence of porcellanitic radiolarian claystones (Plate 1, Fig. 2) belonging to lithostratigraphic Unit II (van Hinte, Wise, et al., in press). The sediment is quite different from the coeval siliceous nannofossil chalks and limestones at the three other sites, because Site 603 was situated well below the calcite compensation depth (CCD) Poag, C.

Sedimentation rate was low (6 m/m.y. in Unit II), and it decreased through the variegated claystone sequence of the Upper Cretaceous (Unit III) to 3 m./m.y. in the turbiditic, bituminous claystones of the Lower Cretaceous Hatteras Formation (Unit IV) (von Rad and Sard, 1986; van Hinte, Wise, et al., in press). Site 605 (Fig. 3) is situated on the uppermost continental rise off New Jersey at a water depth of 2194 m. A comparatively thick (542-m) uninterrupted sequence of middle to lower Eocene sediments without turbidites provides the opportunity to study silica diagenesis under a burial depth of 200 to 700 m in calcareous pelagic sediments rich in siliceous organisms (van Hinte, Wise, et al., in press). Sedimentation rate was high: 56 m/m.y. in mid-Eocene Unit II, decreasing downhole to the clayrich nannofossil limestones of upper Paleocene Unit IV. Site 612 (Fig. 4) was drilled approximately on USGS line 25, on the middle part of the New Jersey slope at a water depth of 1404 m. The hemipelagic to pelagic deposition was interrupted by a number of unconformities (Site 612 report, this volume; Poag and Low, this volume). However, a sequence of lower Oligocene to lower Eocene nannofossiliferous oozes and chalks, very rich in siliceous organisms, includes the diagenetic boundary between siliceous chalks (Unit II) and porcellanitic nannofossil chalks of lower Eocene Unit III, in Core 36, slightly above the lower/middle Eocene stratigraphic contact (Fig. 4; Plate 2). These oozes and chalks unconformably overlie clayrich foraminiferal chalks of Maestrichtian age and Campanian dark foraminiferal chalks and pyritic black shales. Sedimentation rate was lower than at Site 605, reaching 25 m/m.y. in the middle and 35 m/m.y. in the early Eocene.",,

Gaz de France's 12–1/4"" hole section, in the K12 field, has been a very active arena for technological advancement and new product development. Many new drilling systems and new drill bit designs have been tested and developed through this complex drilling interval. However, even with all of the advanced technology utilized in drilling this section, many operational difficulties remain, due to the variety of formations, the directional requirements, and the length of this interval. Until recently, this section was drilled using a variety of different products, including roller cone and PDC drill bits, on both downhole motors and rotary drive systems. In an effort to improve the performance through this interval, another new technology was introduced to this drilling program, the geared Turbodrill. This new downhole drive system is capable of producing very high mechanical power at the bit, both high torque and relatively high RPM. The high power of this new tool, in conjunction with aggressive PDC drill bits, has proven to provide excellent performance in this challenging environment. This paper will detail the development and characteristics of this new geared Turbodrill, and also analyze recent North Sea case histories that included the 12–1/4"" hole section through the upper Cretaceous chalk down to the upper Permian Zechstein formation. Introduction The development of many new technologies, in combination with the proliferation of more powerful rig pumps, has allowed dramatic drilling performance improvements to be realized through the use of Turbodrills. Although Turbodrills have existed in the industry for over a century, their use has, historically, been somewhat limited. The main reasons that Turbodrills were not widely used in the past included problems with thrust bearings, incompatibility with existing drill bit technology, difficulties in monitoring the torque and RPM output while drilling, and a general lack of sufficient hydraulic power to properly drive the tools in many applications. Recently, new technologies have been developed to overcome all of these historical Turbodrill issues. Further, as drilling programs have become more and more complex, and the measured and total vertical depths (MD, TVD) of wells have increased, rig pumps have generally become more powerful. In the past, it was fairly common for land rigs to have limited available standpipe pressure, but in today's drilling environment, many rigs have plenty of hydraulic power to spare. This paper will discuss these new Turbodrill technologies, and detail the significance of more powerful rig hydraulics.1 Gear reduction is one of the technologies that has greatly expanded the applicability of turbodrilling to many applications. This new development takes advantage of the high power output of Turbodrills by converting high RPM into high torque at the bit. The Dutch sector of the North Sea is one area that has become an excellent example of the performance improvement made possible with the modern Turbodrill, in the form of the new geared Turbodrill, NGT. In the K12 field, the 12–1/4"" section is typically from 6,000 to 7,000 feet long, and often includes a significant amount of directional work. It also includes a wide variety of formations, such as chalk, chert, dolomite, sandstone, marl, claystones, siltstones, shales and anhydrites, and has historically been drilled with PDC drill bits on positive displacement motors (PDMs) and on rotary.",,

Therefore analytical approximations are applied more often for determining the implied volatility. In this paper we derive analytical approximations for calculating the implied volatility using the genetic programming approach. Applying our approximations to experimental data sets we can show that the genetically determined formulas outperform other formulas presented in the literature.",,

The Fat'ha Formation consists of alternation of green marl, li mestone and gypsum in cyclic nature, with sandstone beds in the uppermost part (Ma'ala, 1976) . Due to thick gypsum beds (1.5 – 10 m), which has high dissolving ability, different types and forms of karst are developed, like sinkholes, natural bridges that are interconnected by subsurface valleys. The exposed thickness of the Fat'ha Formation, in the studied a rea is 63 m (Ma'ala, 1976). Whereas, in Khlesia oil well, which is about 60 Km SW of the st udied area, it is 515 m (Gaddo and Parker, 1958 in Ma'ala, 1976). From structural and tectonic points of view, the st udied area is located within the Stable Shelf, represented by Salman – Hadhar Zone (Al-Kadh imi et al., 1996). The studied area, however, is considered to be within the Unstable Sh lf (Fouad, 2009), it is characterized by flat nature, due to almost horizontal beds, with re gional dip towards the east. Some subsurface folds, however, exist within the involved zone, lik e Tayarat anticline and Khlesia Uplift (southwest of the studied area), which have NE – SW trend, without clear surface expression. Two main lineaments with trend of NE – SW are the m ain outstanding features in the studied area. They are about 100 Km in length, exte nding northeastwards off the studied area for about 60 Km, crossing the Tigris river and are only 8 Km apart from each other (Fig.2). The area limited by the two lineaments is densely k arstified; among the karst features is a large doline called the Ashqar sabkha (Salt Marsh ), with many other karst features. Along these lineaments, many folds eastwards of the studi ed area exhibit plunging and/ or doming (Al-Mubarak and Youkhanna, 1976 and Zuwaid, 1993), besides clear control to the trend of Greater Zab River, by the lineament, east of the st udied area (Fig.2). From neotectonic point of view, the studied area is uplifted (since the Late Miocene) with amount of (200 – 250) m. The contour line of + 200 m value exhibits clear bulging with the same trend of the aforementioned two lineaments. Th e estimated rate of regional uplift is about (0.1 – 0.2) cm/ 100 years (Sissakain and Deik ran, 1998). The area limited by the two lineaments, however is subsided, as indicated from the topographical maps with clear southeastern rim, which is (8 – 15) m in height (Fi g.3). The residual gravity anomalies map, scale 1: 250 00 0 (Al-Kadhimi et al., 1974) shows very clear impression for the two lineaments with f ull coincidence to the surface expression. The recorded negative and positive anomalies range from (–0.4 to –0.8) mg and (0.2 – 0.6) mg, respectively (Fig.4). The negative anomalies ar e good indication for the subsidence, indicating continuation of the subsidence down to d epth of (750 – 1000) m (Jassim Al-Bdaiwy, personal communication, 2008). The seism ic attenuation map, scale 1:1000 000 shows also very clear indication for the two lineam nts and subside area, in between. The effect of the a subsidence might be down to about 1 000 m (Dr. Saffa F. Fouad, personal communication, 2008).

Herkat'}]","The Upper Cretaceous sedimentation in the Aures Mountains occurred in a subsident basin delimited to the south by the Saharan platform and by the Preatlasic high zone to the north. In these series 4 transgressive-regressive megasequences are distinguished, the first one (I) in the late Albian-Cenomanian, the second one (II) in the Turonian, the third one (III) in the Coniacian - Santonian and the fourth one (IV) in the Campanian - Maastrichtian. Each megasequence is made up of three or four sequences, which correspond to third order cycles identified in the eustatic chart of Haq et al. [1987]. In late Albian and lower Turonian periods, during the deposition of basal sequences of the megasequences I and II. the reactivation of basement faults in the Aures basin occurs consecutively to distension phases, resulting in the formation of rotated blocks. At the same time high eustatic levels are reached according to the global eustatic curve. These processes control the drowning of the carbonate platforms pre-existing to these sequences, and deep ramps progressively form on the tilted block tops. This sedimentary setting generates in the late Albian and lower Turonian series anoxic sequences made up of calcareous and shaly transgressive pelagic intervals. The succeeding sequences lack pelagic facies and are composed of alternate marls/carbonate beds deposited on a homoclinal ramp, indicating a gradual development of shallow open marine conditions, which became progressively restricted upwards. Toward the top of these megasequences, lagunal muds and isolated rudists mounds, Surrounded by bioclastic and ooid/pellet banks occur. The Comacian-Santonian and Campaman-Maastrichtian megasequences are characterized by a shallow ramp sedimentation, essentially marly during the Coniacian, Santonian and Campanian periods, interlayered with some bioclastic/ooid carbonate banks and upwards by sequences mostly homogeneous. The Maastrichtian platform carbonates are composed of bioclastic/ooid sands and were deposited in a ramp-barrier-bank system. Some sequences in the Campanian-Maastrichtian megasequence are condensed or absent due to the accommodation reduction related to a weak subsidence rate period.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/F0/BB/D4/F0BBD469464268D829EC8841FC168EC1.pdf

Adabi', 'org': 'University of Shahid Beheshti School of Earth Sciences Evin Tehran Iran'}]","Some workers have argued that the mineralogy of ancient carbonates may have been different from that of modern sediments,
 with calcite being considered the dominant mineral during the Ordovician, Devonian-mid Carboniferous, and Jurassic-Cretaceous
 to Early/Middle Cenozoic (e.g. Sandberg 1983; Wilkinson and Algeo 1989). Variation in carbonate mineralogy has been related
 to the position of global sea level (emergent or submergent modes, Wilkinson et al. 1985), change in rates of seafloor spreading
 (e.g. Mackenzie and Pigott 1981; Hardie 1996),PCO
 2 level (e.g. Sandberg 1985; Mackenzie and Morse 1992; Hallock 1997) and Mg/Ca ratios related to spreading rate (e.g. Stanley
 and Hardie 1998). However, other researchers suggest that the assumption of change of original carbonate mineralogy through
 time needs to be re-evaluated in the light of mineralogical change that is related to water temperature or latitudes (e.g.
 Nelson 1988). Evaluation of Ordovician (Arenig to Ashgill) Gordon Group carbonates of Tasmania (Australia), based on petrographic
 (e.g. abundantChlorozoan biota, and oomold texture) and geochemical criteria (such as high Sr/Na ratios) indicated that aragonite (not calcite) was the
 predominant mineral in these warm water, subtropical carbonates (Rao 1990). Petrographic (e.g. presence or absence of aragonite
 relicts, abundant acicular to fibrous isopachous marine cement, presence of diffuse laminae and a number of spalled ooids)
 and geochemical evidences (such as elevated Sr) in the Upper Jurassic Mozduran limestone, in Kopet-Dagh Basin in northeast
 Iran, showed variation in carbonate mineralogy, in spite of similar atmosphericPCO
 2 level, global sea-level and tectonic setting. This is evidenced by aragonite occurring in the shallowest part of the basin
 (Adabi and Rao 1991) and mainly calcite with some aragonite forming in the relatively deeper water (below wave base) (Adabi
 1997). Carbonate mineralogy in Recent shallow marine carbonates, and in experimental studies, varies with seawater temperature.
 In the Recent, aragonite is the predominant mineral in warm, shallow marine carbonates and calcite the dominant mineral in
 marine cool water carbonates (James and Clarke 1997). Therefore, variations in carbonate mineralogy in the Mozduran limestone
 are attributed to seawater temperature assuming invariant seawater chemistry prevailed in the Upper Jurassic. Several Jurassic
 examples show variations in ooid carbonate mineralogy, such as the Upper Jurassic Smackover oolite of the Gulf Coast region
 (southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana) and Upper Jurassic ooids in the Purbeck limestones of Swiss and French Jura. These
 results are not in agreement with the concept of a “calcite sea” during the Ordovician and the Upper Jurassic periods. Very
 recently, Westphal and Munnecke (2003) showed that in spite of the tendency of abiotic precipitates (Sandberg 1983) and skeletal
 mineralogy (Stanley and Hardie 1999) to follow the general trend of calcite seas and aragonite seas, organisms with calcite
 and aragonite mineralogy coexisted throughout the Phanerozoic. They have examined the temporal and spatial distribution of
 limestone-marl alternations in Ordovician, Jurassic and Cretaceous (times of calcite seas). Limestone-marl alternations are
 most abundant in settings that favored aragonite production and accumulation analogous to the modern environment (Westphal
 and Munnecke 2003). If the above observations confirmed, the proposed secular variation in Phanerozoic carbonate mineralogy
 needs to be re-evaluated.",,

The delta C-13(organic) values are systematicallly ighter (mean = -21.0 +/- 0.82 parts per thousand) in all sapropels and heavier (mean = -18.8 +/- 1.07 parts per thousand) in the marl oozes. These differences are not due to variable marine and terrestrial organic matter mixtures because all values are heavier than modem plankton in the Mediterranean, there is no relationship between the C-organic/N ratios and the isotopic values, and published information on the abundance and distribution of organic biomarkers shows that terrestrial material constitutes a minor fraction of the total organic matter. Temperature effects on isotope fractionation are also discounted because the change in delta C-13(organic) values between glacial and interglacial horizons is in the opposite sense. Diagenesis, which can produce relatively small changeis in the carbon isotopic composition of sedimentary organic matter under certain circumstances, is unlikely to have caused the observed differences because this mechanism would cause an e enrichment C-12, implying that all values were even heavier originally, and there is no secular trend in the delta C-13(organic) record. The observed differences in delta C-13(organic) between the two lithologies are probably produced by changes in the isotopic composition and the concentration of dissolved CO2. First, freshwater flooding during the formation of the sapropels caused the isotopic composition of the dissolved in organic carbon in the surface waters of the Mediterranean to become lighter because of the C-13 deficiency in fresh waters. Hence photosynthesis would have produced isotopically lighter organic material. Second, changes in atmospheric pCO(2) between glacial and interglacial periods, as shown by the Vostok ice core, caused marked changes in the concentration of free ;dissolved CO2 in the mixed layer; lower values during glacial maxima caused a smaller fractionation of the carbon isotopes by phytoplankton, whereas levels were less limiting during the interglacials. Concentrations of dissolved CO2 could also have been much higher during the deposition of the sapropels cause of the supply of regenerated CO2 to the mixed layer by upwelling, and this could have further lightented the delta C-13(organic) values in he sapropels themselves. Carbon isotope records may provide an alternative method of or estimating atmospheric pCO(2) levels over longer time periods than can be obtained from ice cores.",,

The acquisition of new data on the terrigenous units of the Cilento, thanks to a 1:10,000 scale survey, the study of key sections and numerous biostratigraphic analyses, has led to new stratigraphical and structural interpretations. The Mesozoic-Palaeogene carbonate succession and its mostly Miocene terrigenous cover are overthrust by at least three tectonic units comprising terrigenous strata. The uppermost terrigenous unit corresponds to the North-Calabrian Unit of Bonardi et alii (1988b) and consists of pelagic and basinal facies which can be correlated with the upper portion of the Crete Nere Formation, with the Saraceno Formation and with the The age of the stratigraphic succession can be referred to the Bartonian-Burdigalian. This tectonic unit also corresponds to the Cilento Base Unit of Mauro & Schiattarella (1988). The intermediate terrigenous unit corresponds to the Castelnuovo Cilento Unit of Cammarosano et alii (2000) and is characterised by facies very similar to those of North-Calabrian Unit, which, from the bottom to the top, are the Genesio Shales, the T. Trenico Marls and Calcarenites, and the Pianelli The age of this succession is also Bartonian-Burdigalian. The unit corresponds to those described in the literature as Affinita Sicilide Complex or parasicilides Auctt.. The lower terrigenous unit consists of pelagic and basinal facies correlated with the Tempa Rossa Varicoloured Clays and the Mt. Sant9Arcangelo Formation of the Corleto-Perticara succession. This unit is ascribed to the Sicilide Unit Auctt. and the age of the stratigraphic succession is also Eocene-Early Miocene. The marked similarities in facies and ages suggest that the successions of the North-Calabrian and Castelnuovo Cilento units were deposited in the same basin, and that their present division is essentially due to tectonic processes. These tectonic units probably began to develop in the Late Burdigalian. A succession of piggyback basin deposits of Early Langhian to Early Tortonian age and pertaining to the Cilento Group lies unconformably above the upper terrigenous unit. This succession is in turn unconformably overlain by the Mt. Sacro Conglomerates, which are therefore no older than the Middle Tortonian. The results of field surveys and regional-scale studies highlighted the need for a lithostratigraphic revision of the Cilento Group, here originally consisting of the and St. Mauro Formations Auctt., each comprising 2 members. The members of the Formation Auctt. (the and members) are now considered formations in their own right, and are respectively named Cannicchio and Pollica Sandstones. The Sandstones are in continuity with the Saraceno Formation, whereas their upper contact with the Sandstones is characterised by a marked change in facies and a likely biostratigraphical lacuna. The upper stratigraphic succession of the North-Calabrian unit in the Cilento therefore consists of Sandstones, whereas the Cilento Group consists of the Sandstones and San Mauro Formation. The San Mauro Formation contains numerous key horizons, some of which are here described for the first time; however, we believe that the rapid variation in facies does not justify, on a regional scale and according to classical lithostratigraphic criteria, its subdivision into two members as proposed by previous studies. Based on the age of the younger terrains at the top of the carbonate unit (the Serravallian-Tortonian Piaggine Sandstones; Castellano et alii, 1997), the emplacement of the terrigenous units above the carbonates occurred no earlier than the Late Tortonian. The main structures which involve the terrigenous flysch and characterise the tectonic edifice are the low-angle thrust surfaces that delimit the tectonic units. These were newly-deformed by transcurrent and extensional faults, with orientation NW-SE to E-W, probably formed in the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The Cilento Group and Sandstones are often detached from the substratum through low-angle extensional faults verging towards the Tyrrhenian Sea. These surfaces also dislocate the thrust planes of the tectonic units, and are compatible with the transtensional faults bordering the southern slopes of the carbonate ranges; this decollement probably also developed during the Plio-Pleistocene extensional phases.",,

Hydrogen and oxygen isotopic geochemistry shows that the earlier ore-forming fluids during the anhydrous skarn stage (I) and the hydrous skarn-magnetite stage (II) were mainly derived from magmatic water, while the later fluids during the quartz-sulfide stage (III) and the carbonate stage (IV) were mainly from magmatic water mixed with small amounts of meteoric water. Various types of fluid inclusions, including abundant vapor- or liquid-rich two-phase aqueous inclusions, daughter minerals-bearing multiphase inclusions, CO 2 –H 2 O inclusions, and less abundant liquid inclusions, vapor inclusions and melt inclusions, are present in hydrothermal minerals of different stages. The liquid–vapor fluid inclusions are mainly composed of H 2 O, with significant amounts of CO 2 and a small amount of CH 4 . In the opaque-bearing fluid inclusions, the hematite and fahlore (tetrahedrite) were identified. The homogenization temperature of the aqueous fluid inclusions decreases from Stage I (520–410 °C), through Stage II (430–340 °C) and III (250–190 °C), to Stage IV (190–130 °C). The coexistence of melt inclusions with simultaneously trapped vapor- or liquid-rich two-phase aqueous inclusions and daughter minerals-bearing multiphase inclusions in garnet, diopside and epidote of Stages I and II suggests an immiscibility between silicate melt and hydrothermal fluid. It is an effective mechanism on scavenging and transporting ore-forming components from magmas. The aqueous fluid inclusions with various vapor/liquid ratios (from <10% to >65%) commonly coexist with simultaneously trapped liquid inclusions, vapor inclusions, daughter minerals-bearing multiphase inclusions and CO 2 –H 2 O inclusions in the quartz of Stage III, and the different kinds of the fluid inclusions have similar homogenization temperatures. This indicates that the boiling – another kind of immiscibility, widely took place during Stage III. It resulted in the precipitation and enrichment of gold, copper and iron. Keywords Immiscibility Boiling Fluid inclusion H–O isotopes Yinan Au–Cu–Fe deposit Shandong 1 Introduction There are three types of mineralization associated with immiscibility in nature: (1) The separation of immiscible magmatic melt leads to the formation of metallic and silicate melt. For instance, the immiscibility of copper–nickel sulfide melt and silicate melt can form the copper–nickel sulfide deposits ( Naldrett, 1989 ); (2) during the late stage of magmatic crystallization, the silicate melt immiscibly separates from the H 2 O–CO 2 –H 2 S bearing volatiles, leading to the formation of ore-bearing gas–water hydrothermal fluids. These fluids can form deposit by means of replacement and filling ( Jin et al., 1999; Fulignati et al., 2001; Campos et al., 2002; Reyf, 2004; Cesare et al., 2007 ); and (3) boiling and phase separation occur in various ore-bearing gas–water hydrothermal fluids along with decompression, resulting in the precipitation and concentration of ore-forming minerals ( Reed and Spycher, 1985; Zhu, 1999; Graupner et al., 2001; Gu et al., 2003; Calagari, 2004; Coulibaly et al., 2008 ). Therefore, immiscibility between hydrous silicate melt and hydrous saline melt (and aqueous solutions) is responsible for many ore deposits in particular ( Roedder, 1992 ). The fluid inclusions and H–O isotopes are microscopic records of the sources and evolution of ore-forming fluids, as well as the immiscibility process during mineralization. As a typical Au–Cu–Fe polymetallic skarn deposit, the Yinan deposit has become a serious crisis mine after more than 50 years of exploitation. From 1957, when it was discovered, to 2006, it was mined constantly and has produced 6000,000 t of ore which yielded 20,000 t of copper, 1050,000 t of iron, 300,000 oz of gold, and 3,80,000 oz of silver. The serious shortage of reserves turns successful resource exploration into a top priority. Although the most recent exploration in 2007–2009 (new discovered resource of 19,000 t of copper, 6000,000 of iron and 4,80,000 oz of gold) indicated a significant progress on ore prospecting in the deep and peripheral mining area ( Gu et al., 2008a ), the scientific research of this deposit is still limited. Therefore, the in-depth understanding of the mineralization laws and ore-controlling factors has been constrained. The samples of different stages in the Yinan deposit provide a wealth of material for the study of fluid inclusions and H–O isotopes. From this, we seek to identify the source of ore-forming fluids, recognize the types of immiscibility, and discuss the relationships between immiscibility and mineralization. 2 Regional geological setting The Yinan Au–Cu–Fe deposit is located in the western Shandong Province (Luxi area) on the west side of Tanlu fault zone, on the southeast margin of the North China plate. It is composed of the Tongjing and Jinchang Mines which are about 6 km away from each other ( Fig. 1 ). The basement formed in the Luxi area after experiencing a series of geological processes such as sedimentation, metamorphism, magmatism, magmatic activities, cymatogeny and craton consolidation from Archean to Paleoproterozoic. Then the rocks were uplifted and experienced denudation. As a result, the Late Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic sediments were removed from the geologic record resulting in unconformity surface. During the Neoproterozoic, the Taishan continental craton cracked longitudinally, forming the Yishu rift. The Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic strata deposited on the rift basin and formed the cap rock above the unconformity surface ( Cao, 1995; Song and Li, 2001; Hou et al., 2004 ). During the Yanshanian, the Tanlu fault system had experienced sinistral strike-slip movement, and this tension action induced the invasion and emplacement of intermediate-acidic magmas along the composite positions of NE trending faults (branch faults of the Tanlu fault zone) and the NW faults in cap rock. Consequently, extensive tectonic magmatic activities occurred in the Luxi area ( Zou and Shen, 2001; Zhu et al., 2002; Shen et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2007 ). Various types of polymetallic deposits (hydrothermal metasomatic and breccia type) are related to intermediate-acidic magmatic activities of the Yanshan period in this area ( Xu et al., 1999, 2002; Liu et al., 2002 ). 3 Geology of the Yinan deposit The deposit is produced in the contact zones between the Tongjing and the Jinchang intermediate-acidic complexes of Yanshanian and the strata from Neo-Archean to Cambrian ( Fig. 2 ). It is controlled by magmatic rocks, strata lithology and structures, showing typical characteristics of skarn deposits ( Gu et al., 2008b ). The Tongjing complex (in the Tongjing mining area) outcrops as stocks, and on its edges there is sill intruded into the wallrock, showing irregular shape on the surface area with approximately 4.4 km 2 . There is mainly quartz diorite in the western part and quartz diorite porphyrite in the eastern part of this complex ( Fig. 2 A), and the respective K–Ar ages of the whole-rock are 125.5 Ma and 117.5 Ma ( Zheng and Luo, 1996 ). The quartz diorite is intruded by quartz diorite porphyrite or forms xenoliths, indicating that the emplacement of quartz diorite may be earlier than quartz diorite porphyrite. Most recent LA–ICP–MS dating of zircon from quartz diorite yields a mean age of 135.8 ± 2.7 Ma ( Li, 2009 ). The Jinchang complex (in the Jinchang mining area) is composed of intrusion and dykes: the Jinchang intrusion is located in its western part and the Yeguanmu dyke is situated at its eastern part. The ring-like and radial dykes are distributed around the complex ( Fig. 2 B). The Jinchang intrusion shows round-shaped at the surface, with an area of about 0.2 km 2 . There is porphyritic medium- and fine-grain monzonitic granite in its center, surrounded with granite porphyry, and gradually transiting to veins and dykes towards the outside. The Yeguanmu dyke shows dumbbell shape in the surface of the NE-direction extension with an area of about 0.1 km 2 . It is mainly composed of granite porphyry, and the K–Ar age of the whole-rock is 121 Ma. The geochemical studies indicate that ( Gu et al., 2008b ), the calc-alkaline ore-forming complex plutons are relatively silicic, alkalic, and magnetite-bearing with high coefficient of oxidation (Fe 2 O 3 /(Fe 2 O 3 + FeO) > 0.5), and they are broadly similar to the oxidized, Au skarn-related plutons defined by Meinert (1989, 1998, 2000) . In the mining area, the stratigraphic sequences include Neoarchean Taishan Group (Ar 3t ), Neoproterozoic Tumen Group ( Z t ), Lower Cambrian Chuangqing Group ( ϵ c ) and Middle-Upper Cambrian Jiulong Group ( ϵ j ) ( Fig. 3 A). The Archean Taishan Group is the crystalline basement, and is angular unconformably overlain by the cover composed of the Proterozoic and Cambrian strata. The Archean basement is mainly composed of granitic gneiss, plagioclase amphibolite and hornblende granulite. The Neoproterozoic Tumen Group is a set of shallow marine sedimentary facies. Gray–white medium- and fine-grain sandstone and pebbly sandstone are at the bottom, and the gray–yellow and gray–purple shale intercalated with lamella marl are at its middle and upper parts. The Cambrian Changqing Group is mainly a set of fine clastic rocks, calcareous mudstone and shale interbedded with lamella marl, oolitic limestone, calcarenite and dolomitic limestone. The Cambrian Jiulong Group is mainly composed of thin-bedded limestone, wormkalk, oolitic limestone, bioclastic limestone and argillaceous dolomite, intercalated with shale in some region. The strata above the unconformity plane are gently inclined to the surrounding center on the Yanshanian intermediate-acidic complexes (dip angle <15°). Far from the intrusion, the attitude of stratum tends to horizontal, showing the characteristics of a dome structure ( Gu et al., 2008a ). There are a total of 14 layers of ores in this deposit. All of them are produced in the contact zones of Yanshanian intermediate-acidic complexes and Neoproterozoic–Cambrian wallrock, in which two layers of ores are produced on the unconformity surface of Archean basement and in the Neoproterozoic strata, and 12 layers of ores occur in the Cambrian strata ( Fig. 3 A; Gu et al., 2008a ). The outputs of ore-bodies are controlled by the contact zone between intrusion and wall rock and the tectonic weak zone in the Neoproterozoic–Cambrian wall rock (unconformity surface, interlayer fractured zone, and decollement zone). The shapes of ore-bodies are variable, including bedded-, lenticular- or irregular-shapes ( Fig. 3 B and C). Generally, the ore-bodies are 140–200 m long on the direction of strike, and are 100–150 m on the direction of dip; their thicknesses range from 0.5 to 11.6 m. The average grade of ore body: Au 1–5 g/t, Cu 0.5–0.8%, TFe 27–33% ( Gu et al., 2008a ). The ores are mainly with massive, disseminated, vein-stockwork shaped, banded and brecciated textures ( Fig. 4 ). The meta-somatic relict, poikilitic, skeletal and pseudomorph textures are less common. Magnetite is abundant and it occurs as massive bodies or vein-stockworks cementing fragments of anhedral to subeuhedral garnet and diopside. Chalcopyrite occurs as disseminations or as veinlets accompanying with quartz. Banded ore with alternating bands composed of anhedral to subeuhedral garnet and epidote ( Fig. 4 A). The brecciated ores are pervasively developed, that is, later quartz and sulfide veinlets often cut early skarn minerals and magnetite, indicating that the Cu mineralization occurred later than the deposition of the skarn and magnetite ( Fig. 4 B–E). The latter assemblage (quartz + sulfide) is then broken and cemented by later quartz and calcite ( Fig. 4 C–E). The native Au is mostly associated with quartz and sulfide ( Fig. 4 F). According to the mineral paragenesis and interspersed relationship between veins, the mineralization process can be divided into four stages: the anhydrous skarn stage (I, garnet + diopside), the hydrous skarn-magnetite stage (II, epidote + magnetite + specularite ± tremolite ± actinolite ± quartz), the quartz-sulfide stage (III, quartz + chalcopyrite + pyrite + native gold ± chlorite), and the carbonate stage (IV, calcite ± quartz). Wall-rock alteration are widely distributed in the contact zones between complexes and wall rocks, in the areas nearby the interlayer fractures, and under or above the unconformity surfaces, with the range of alteration up to 200–300 m or even more. Endoskarn and relative altered ores occur within intrusions associated with K-feldspar alteration, and consist of garnet, pyroxene and minor vesuvianite. Exoskarn typically occurs in an external zone associated with marbles or hornfels, and consists of garnet and diopside. Retrograde alteration is widely distributed in the fractured zone; it consists of quartz, calcite, chlorite and sericite, accompanied by sulfide minerals such as chalcopyrite, pyrite, bornite, and minor amounts of pyrrhotite, galena and sphalerite. 4 Characteristics of fluid Inclusions and H–O isotopes 4.1 Methods of investigation Hydrothermal minerals of different stages from drill holes and tunnels were selected for thermometric analysis. The microthermometric studies were carried out in the fluid inclusion laboratory at Chengdu University of Technology. The phase transitions of the fluid inclusions were observed at temperatures from −196 °C to 600 °C using a Linkham THMSG-600 heating/freezing stage. Temperature measurement is accurate to ±0.1 °C at −22 °C and the error increases gradually to ±2 °C at 400 °C relative to standard material. Temperatures were controlled at 20 °C/min during heating or freezing process, and less than 4 °C/min near the phase transition point. Certain inclusion constituents were determined using a Renishaw Invia Reflex-type confocal Laser Raman microspectrometry (LRM) in the fluid inclusion laboratory at China University of Geosciences (Beijing). The test conditions: 514.5 nm light of an argon–ion laser, 20 mW laser power, 7 mW laser power at sample surface, 1800 grooves/mm grating, spectral resolution of 2 cm −1 , spatial resolution of 1 μm (×100 lens), 60 s scan time, scan range of 0–4000 cm −1 . The wavenumber accuracy was ±1 cm −1 . The H–O isotopes were analyzed in the stable isotope laboratory of Mineral Resources Institute, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, using the methods of ( Clayton and Mayeda, 1963 ) in a Finnigan MAT253-type mass spectrometer. Oxygen gas was produced by quantitatively reacting the samples with BrF 5 in externally heated nickel reaction vessels. Hydrogen was determined by quantitatively reacting the H 2 O with zinc at temperature of 550 °C. The results adopted the SMOW as their standards, with a precision of ±2‰ for δ D and ±0.2‰ for δ 18 O. 4.2 Characteristics of primary fluid inclusion Representative host minerals including garnet (Stage I), diopside (Stage I), epidote (Stage II), quartz (Stage III) and calcite (Stage IV) of four stages were selected for analysis. These host minerals contain both primary and secondary fluid inclusions. The fluid inclusions are usually small in diameter, generally ranging from 5 to 10 μm, with a minimum size of <1 μm and maximum size of 25–30 μm. Various shapes of inclusions include negative crystal shaped, spheroidal, ellipsoidal, elongate, square, rectangular and irregular. Only primary inclusions are chosen to analyze and discuss in the following text. Based on the components and phase transitions characteristic of inclusions at room temperature (25 °C), several types of fluid inclusions have been identified, including abundant vapor- or liquid-rich two-phase aqueous inclusions (V + L), daughter mineral-bearing multiphase inclusions (S + V + L), CO 2 –H 2 O inclusions (CO 2 + V + L), and less abundant liquid inclusions (L), vapor inclusions (V), possibly melt inclusions (M) ( Figs. 5 and 6 ). The combinations of inclusions are different in various hydrothermal minerals. The inclusions in garnet (Stage I) are mainly V + L type inclusions, and occasionally S + V + L, M and L type inclusions. The inclusions in diopside (Stage I) are mainly V + L and S + V + L type inclusions (opaques, halite and sylvite), and occasionally M and L type inclusions. The inclusions in epidote (Stage II) are mainly V + L and opaque-bearing S + V + L type inclusions, followed by transparent minerals-bearing (halite) S + V + L type inclusions, and occasionally V and M type inclusions. Some M type inclusions also occasionally occur in the coexisting quartz (Stage II). The inclusions in Stage III quartz are various, including V + L, S + V + L, CO 2 + V + L, L and V type inclusions. The inclusions in calcite (Stage IV) are mainly V + L type inclusions, and the next are L type inclusions. Inclusions in Stages II and IV quartz veinlets are too small to be chosen for micro-thermometric analysis. It is clear from the inclusion analysis that vapor–liquid two-phase aqueous inclusions are the most widely distributed. Their vapor–liquid ratios (vapor filling degrees) vary from 1% to 75% and usually are in the range of 5–35%. Their main components are composed of H 2 O, with significant amounts of CO 2 and a small amount of CH 4 ( Fig. 6 A, B and D). CO 2 –H 2 O inclusions are composed of vapor CO 2 , liquid CO 2 and H 2 O. The CO 2 (mainly vapor CO 2 ) phase accounts for 10–90% of the total volume of inclusions ( Fig. 6 C). Daughter mineral-bearing multiphase inclusions contain liquid, vapor and solid phases, of which the vapor bubble occupies 5–10% of the cavity volume and solid minerals account for 3–20% of the inclusion volume. Their liquid and vapor phase are mainly H 2 O identified by laser Raman. There are two types of daughter minerals: transparent and opaque. The cubic halite is by far the most common solid phase, accompanied by minor equant to anhedral sylvite ( Fig. 5 ). The opaque are difficult to analyze by laser Raman, only the hematite and fahlore (tetrahedrite) (Fa) were identified ( Fig. 6 E and F). Hematite (Ht) was readily recognized by their red color, and its Raman spectra is consistent with the hematite Raman shift near two A 1g modes (225 and 498 cm −1 ) and five E g modes (247, 293, 299, 412 and 613 cm −1 ) ( de Faria et al., 1997 ). The micro-Raman spectra of fahlore occurs between 200 and 400 cm −1 . Fitting of the spectrum occurs near 325 and 352 cm −1 , and the appearance of the spectra change (near 382 cm −1 ) may be related to the Sb/(Sb + As) ( Mernagh and Trudu, 1993; Kharbish et al., 2007 ). The host mineral of fahlore is diopside (Di) (stageI) whose Raman shift is near 667 and 1012 cm −1 ( Xu et al., 1996 ) ( Fig. 6 ). It cannot exclude the possibility that there exist other opaque like chalcopyrite and magnetite according to the petrographic observation. Melt inclusions occasionally occur in the garnet, diopside, epidote and quartz, being composed of several silicate daughter minerals and bubbles. The silicate daughter minerals have different interference colors from the ones of host minerals under the orthogonal polarizing microscope, and there was no phase change when they underwent heating up to 600 °C. It is worth noticing that there are different types of inclusions that appear to be coeval in the same domain of the diopside (Stage I), epidote (Stage II) and quartz (Stage III) under the microscope. In the quartz, the vapor–liquid two-phase aqueous inclusions with various vapor/liquid ratios (from <10% to >65%) commonly coexist with simultaneously trapped other types of inclusions, showing the characteristics of boiling (immiscibility). 4.3 Homogenization temperature and salinity Micro-thermometric analysis was performed principally on primary fluid inclusions in the hydrothermal minerals representing different mineralization stages. Two common thermometric procedures, freezing and heating, were employed to determine the homogenization temperatures ( t h ), melting temperatures of CO 2 clathrate ( t mcl ) and approximate salinities (NaCl eq ) in wt.% respectively. Last ice melting temperatures ( t ice ), daughter homogenization temperatures ( t m ) or melting temperatures of CO 2 clathrate ( t mcl ) were measured to calculate salinities according to the formula proposed by Potter et al. (1978), Collins (1979), Hall et al. (1988) and Bodnar (1993) . A summary of data is presented in Table 1 and Fig. 7 . The homogenization temperatures of inclusions in garnet (Stage I) vary from 427 to 549 °C, with an average of 487 °C. The ones in diopside (Stage I) vary between 369–484 °C, with an average of 433 °C. The t ice of fluid inclusions in Stage I minerals were not listed owing to the possibility of large error. The salinity of one halite-bearing inclusion is 56.7% NaCl eq in the garnet. While the salinity of nine halite-bearing inclusions is 49.6–70.2% NaCl eq in the diopside (average 56.3% NaCl eq ). Sometimes sudden movements of bubbles were occasionally observed between 18 and 30 °C in the diopside and could indicate small quantities of CO 2 according to Hedenquist and Henley (1985 ). The ones in epidote (Stage II) vary between 290 °C and 438 °C, with and an average of 368 °C. The t ice of the vapor–liquid two-phase fluid inclusions change in the range of −21.1 °C to −6.4 °C, and the calculated salinity data are 9.7–23.1% NaCl eq , (average 18.1% NaCl eq ). The salinity of two halite-bearing inclusions is 52.0–53.5% NaCl eq (average 52.9% NaCl eq ). The ones in quartz (Stage III) range between130 °C and 335 °C, with most of 150–300 °C and an average of 226 °C. The t ice of V + L fluid inclusions change in the range of −13.5 °C to −4.0 °C and the calculated salinity data are 6.5–17.3% NaCl eq (average 11.7% NaCl eq ). The salinity of 23 S + V + L inclusions is 41.5–57.1% NaCl eq (average 47.8% NaCl eq ). The t mcl of CO 2 + V + L inclusions are within the range 4.7–6.9 °C, and the calculated salinity is approximately 5.9–9.4% NaCl eq (average 8.1% NaCl eq ). It is equal to the estimated salinity using t ice of vapor–liquid aqueous inclusions ( Table 1 ). During the freezing–heating process, a small amount of incipient melting of the liquid–vapor two-phase fluid inclusions in quartz can be observed. The first (eutectic) melting temperatures are in the range of −31.2 °C to −27.5 °C, which are lower than the standard eutectic point (−20.8 °C) in the pure H 2 O–NaCl system. Low eutectic temperatures suggest that, the hydrothermal fluids are polysaline and multi-cation (K + , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ ) in addition to the Na + ( Ruano et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2004 ). The first eutectic temperature range indicates it could be H 2 O–NaCl–KCl (−22.5 °C) or H 2 O–MgCl 2 (−33.6 °C) system. The presence of sylvite in some fluid inclusions proves the existence of KCl. Furthermore, the triple point of CO 2 + V + L inclusions in quartz ranges from −58.2 °C to −57.1 °C, which is lower than the standard triple point (−56.6 °C) of the pure CO 2 . It suggests that, the fluid inclusions may contain CH 4 , H 2 S and other volatiles in addition to the CO 2 . The ones in calcite (Stage IV) range between 102 °C and 268 °C, with the majority of 100–200 °C and an average of 163 °C. It can be seen that the temperatures of ore-forming fluids decrease during successive stages of the mineralization process. The t ice change in the range of −11.8 °C to −1.2 °C and the calculated salinity data are in the range of 2.1–15.8% NaCl eq (average 9.1% NaCl eq ). What is noteworthy is that the vapor bubbles in diopside homogenize before halite or nearly simultaneously disappear with halite. While the fluid inclusions in epidote and quartz typically homogenize by halite dissolution. That is, the halite temperatures of melting ( t m ) are greater than or equal to the liquid homogenization temperatures ( t h ) of S + V + L type inclusions and homogenization temperatures ( t h ) of coexisting V + L type fluid inclusions ( Table 1 , Fig. 7 ). These S + V + L type inclusions may suggest entrapment of halite supersaturated fluid (halite crystal + salinity fluid) ( Calagari, 2004 ). The trapped temperatures of S + V + L type inclusions should be equal to the homogenization temperatures of coexisting V + L type inclusions ( t h ) ( Chen et al., 2010 ). Alternatively, the simultaneous homogenization of halite and bubble or homogenization of halite dissolution may also indicate critical to high density, as illustrated by Bodnar (1994) . 4.4 Hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions Petrographic studies on doubly polished section have shown that the fluid inclusions in hydrothermal minerals for the H analysis are dominated (>95%) by primary inclusions in both number and volume. They typically have rounded or negative crystal shapes. Therefore, the fluids extracted from the inclusions are thought to represent the primary ore forming solutions. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic data of different stage minerals and calculated δ 18 O H2O values of ore-forming fluids are listed in Table 2 . The δ 18 O H2O values were calculated based on the fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures and fractionation equation between minerals and water, according to the equations of O’Neil and Epstein (1966), O’Neil et al. (1969), Lu and Yang (1982) and Zheng and Chen (2000) . There into, the formation temperatures of garnet, quartz and calcite can be basically represented by the mean values of their homogenization temperatures. The formation temperatures of specularite and magnetite are represented by the mean homogenization temperatures of their paragenetic epidote. 5 Discussion 5.1 The source of ore-forming fluids The hydrogen and oxygen isotope of fluid at different mineralizing stages in the Yinan Au–Cu–Fe deposit provide important information on the source and the evolution of ore-forming fluids. The δ 18 O H2O value and δ D H2O value (−73‰) of one garnet of the anhydrous skarn stage (I) are 6.8‰ and −73‰ respectively, falling in the range of magmatic fluids ( Taylor, 1974 ) ( Fig. 8 ). The isotopic compositions of magnetite and specularite of the hydrous skarn-magnetite stage (II) are relatively changeable. The δ 18 O H2O values of three samples vary in the range of 7.9–8.3‰, except for one example with 11.6‰ value. The oxygen isotopes still have the characteristics of magmatic fluid generally. The δ D H2O values are low and within the range of −112‰ to −82‰. The wide range may record the degassing of parent magma chamber, as this isotopic fractionation results in lighter δ D values of magmatic water ( Suzuoki and Epstein, 1976 ). The data are also similar to the H–O isotopic compositions ( δ D −110‰ to −65‰, δ 18 O 6.0–9.0‰) of initial mixing magmatic water in the granite of Au–Cu and Fe–Co series defined by Zhang (1985) , indicating the ore-forming fluids at this stage are still dominated by the magmatic water, but the possibility of mixing with a minor amount of meteoric water cannot be ruled out. According to Zhang (1985) , the initial mixing magmatic water refers to the magmatic water exsolved out by the initial magma which is formed by the anataxis of crust affected by the interaction with surface water (atmospheric water, sea water). It leaches/exchanges the (sub-) solidified rocks and forms ore-bearing rebalanced-mixing magmatic hydrothermal fluids ( Zhang, 1985 ). The rebalanced mixing magmatic water is usually rich in D compared with the initial mixing magmatic water. Therefore, there is a relatively large variation on the δ D H2O values of magnetite and specularite precipitated from the initial- and rebalanced-mixing magmatic hydrothermal fluids. Until the quartz-sulfide stage (III) and the carbonate stage (IV), the δ D H2O values (−87‰ to −67‰) of ore-forming fluids still remain the characteristics of magmatic water. However, the δ 18 O H2O values (−2.9‰ to −0.4‰) are significantly low, showing the hydrothermal characteristics of meteoric water with the δ 18 O drift. All the above-mentioned features indicate the ore-forming fluids in this stage were from magmatic water mixed with meteoric water. The hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of the hydrothermal minerals from the Yinan deposit reflect the complexity of the ore-forming process about the skarn deposits to a certain extent. However, the above characteristics are consistent with the general laws of typical skarn-type Cu–Au deposits whose ore-forming fluids are dominated by magmatic water at the early stage and mixed with the meteoric water during the late stage ( Table 2 , Fig. 7 ). For example, the δ 18 O H2O values of ore-forming fluids range between 7.6‰ and 12.9‰, and the δ D H2O values range between −63‰ and −54‰ in the US Elkhorn skarn-type gold deposit during the early skarn stages ( Bowman et al., 1985 ). In the Mashan Au–S deposit in Tongling, Anhui Province, the δ 18 O H2O values are 6.9–10.7‰, and the δ D H2O values are −69‰ to −62‰ at the quartz-sulfide stage ( Tian et al., 2007 ), indicating that the hydrothermal fluids of these two above-mentioned deposits are dominated in magmatic water without or with very small amount of meteoric water during the forming process of skarn and ore bodies. In the Xiaotongguanshan Cu–Au deposit, Tongling, from 5.1‰ to 10.7‰ at the early skarn stage, the δ 18 O H2O values of ore-forming fluids are downgraded as 0.8–5.1‰ at the late quartz-sulfide and carbonate stages, showing that the ore-forming fluids are dominated by magmatic water at an early stage, whereas meteoric water entered the mineralizing system at a late stage ( Tian et al., 2005 ). The hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions ( δ 18 O 2.7–9.2‰, δ D −102‰ to −76‰) of fluid inclusion water in quartz from the Copper Canyon Cu–Au deposits, United States, suggest that the ore-bearing fluids are most likely composed of magmatic water that had mixed with some meteoric water during mineralization ( Batchelder, 1977 ). 5.2 Immiscibility and mineralization Melt inclusions are the magmatic droplets (silicate melts) captured by various types of igneous minerals during their forming process. As the host minerals cool, they quenched and condensed into glass, or further crystallized to an assemblage of silicate daughter minerals and fluid phases (liquid- and vapor-phases). Within garnet, diopside and epidote, occasionally in paragenetic quartz (Stage II) of the skarn stage in the Yinan Au–Cu–Fe deposit, the melt inclusions composed of felsic solids and vapors had no phase changes when being heated to 600 °C, indicating that they were captured in the high-temperature magmatic melts. Interestingly, these melt inclusions often coexisted with the vapor- or liquid-rich two-phase aqueous inclusions of various vapor–liquid ratios and daughter minerals-bearing multiphase inclusions, even coexisting within the same tiny view ( Fig. 5 L and M). Meanwhile, there is no petrographic evidence to demonstrate that they were captured in the different stages. Thus, the above-mentioned phenomenon implies an immiscible state coexisting of melt and fluid ( Roedder and Commbs, 1967 ). The calculated salinities of the coexisting hypersaline inclusions in diopside are up to 70.2 wt.% NaCl eq , implying a magmatic origin ( Harris et al., 2003 ). There are no melt inclusions in the post-skarn stages (the quartz-sulfide stage and the carbonate stage). The above facts further emphasize the genetic relationship between mineralization and magmatism. That is, the ore-forming fluids came from gas–water hydrothermal fluids exsolved by the magmas; the diagenesis and the mineralization experienced the evolution of melt → melt + fluid → fluid. It is usually considered that, with the crystallization of silicate minerals and a progressive decrease of temperature and pressure during the magma evolution, the volatile/silicate melt ratio gradually increases. When the volatiles reach the supersaturation, immiscibility occurs, forming the volatile-rich, high-salinity hydrothermal fluids and the residual silicate melts. At this point, the melt and fluid were trapped by crystallizing minerals simultaneously. Previous literatures have also shown that, silicate melts and multiphase salt-rich inclusions are interpreted as having originally formed as immiscible phases at magmatic temperatures during the magmatic-hydrothermal transition stage ( Kamenetsky et al., 1999 ). There into, volatile-rich highly saline hydrothermal fluids represented by the salt-rich inclusions are effective in scavenging ore-forming components from magmas ( Candela, 1989 ), and have the potential to transport metals ( Davidson and Kamenetsky, 2001 ). They are often the main contributors of hydrothermal fluids and metals in the ensuing skarn- and/or porphyry-mineralization systems ( Eastoe, 1978; Candela, 1989; Bodnar, 1995; Meinert et al., 1997, 2003; Hedenquist et al., 1998; Kamenetsky et al., 1999; Harris et al., 2003 ). The wide occurrence of salts-rich, opaque-bearing (magnetite, chalcopyrite) multiphase fluid inclusions in diopside implies that the fluids are exsolved from the magma at elevated temperature during the early skarn stage ( Campos et al., 2002 ), confirming the important role of the magmatic hydrothermal fluids mentioned above. There is another kind of immiscibility widely spread in the Yinan Au–Fe–Cu deposit. As already noted, the boiling inclusions are developed in the diopside (Stage I), epidote (Stage II) and quartz (Stage III), particularly prevalent in quartz. In the same zone of one mineral, the aqueous fluid inclusions with various vapor/liquid ratios (from <10% to >65%) commonly coexist with liquid inclusions, vapor inclusions, daughter minerals-bearing multiphase inclusions and CO 2 –H 2 O inclusions trapped simultaneously. Petrographic observations show that they are primary inclusions and have similar homogenization temperatures. However, the salinity of vapor–liquid two-phase aqueous fluid inclusions is very different from the one of the paragenetic daughter minerals-bearing multiphase inclusions (varies in the range of 9.7–23.1% NaCl eq and 52.0–53.5% NaCl eq in epidote, 6.5–17.3% NaCl eq and 41.5–57.1% NaCl eq in quartz, respectively), indicating that they were captured in two different fluids with dissimilar natures, namely, one is the low-salinity and low-density fluid, while the other is high-salinity and high-density fluid. This is interpreted as evidence for boiling (immiscibility) ( Lu et al., 2004 ). Sometimes, in some vapor–liquid two-phase inclusions with medium vapor/liquid ratios (40–60%), there was no obvious change of the bubbles being heated above 400 °C, indicating that they were captured in the heterogeneous fluid phase (liquid-phase + vapor-phase) at the boiling state. Petrographic observation and micro-thermometric analysis reveal that, the boiling occurred in a wide range of temperatures from 130 °C to 430 °C, and most of the temperatures were concentrated in the range of 190–280 °C at the quartz-sulfide stage. Serving as one of the main ways of natural fluid immiscibility, boiling of ore-forming fluids is considered as an important mechanism in the metal precipitation and enrichment in many hydrothermal deposits ( Roedder, 1984; Reed and Spycher, 1985; Logan, 2000; Shen et al., 2000, 2001; Yao et al., 2001; Ruano et al., 2002; Gu et al., 2003; Calagari, 2004; Zhou et al., 2007 ). Speciation and reaction progress calculations confirm that boiling would be a more efficient depositional mechanism than cooling or mixing of the ore fluid with groundwater ( Graney et al., 1991 ). Due to boiling, the vapor-phase H 2 O, as well as H 2 S, CO 2 , HCl and other acidic components is constantly escaping from the original homogeneous fluid phases. The increasing pH values and the decreasing temperatures will promote the instability of metal complexes and lead to the precipitation of metal oxides (magnetite), sulfides (chalcopyrite, pyrite) and native gold ( Reed and Spycher, 1985 ): 3 Fe 2 + + 4 H 2 O → Fe 3 O 4 ( magnetite ) + 6 H + + H 2 Fe 2 + + Cu 2 + + 2 HS - → CuFeS 2 ( chalcopyrite ) + 2 H + Fe 2 + + 2 HS - → FeS 2 ( pyrite ) + 2 H + Au ( HS ) 2 - + H + + 0.5 H 2 → Au ( native gold ) + 2 H 2 S The opaque-bearing (magnetite, chalcopyrite) multiphase fluid inclusions abound in epidote and quartz indicating that the boiling was the main mechanism leading to the precipitation of metallic minerals. It is generally accepted that boiling is mainly caused by the sudden pressure decrease (lithostatic pressure converts into hydrostatic pressure). The rapid pressure release is either related to fracturing or resulted from the hydrofracturing occurring when the fluid pressure exceeds the resistance of overlying rocks. Therefore, in addition to the micro-geological evidences (occurrence of plenty of boiling fluid inclusions), lots of brecciated structures often developed in the ore deposit are the macro-geological marks of the boiling fluids. During the hydrous skarn-magnetite stage (II) and the quartz-sulfide stage (III) in the Yinan deposit, early fractured skarn minerals and magnetite are often cemented by later quartz and sulfide, and then the latter are broken and cemented by later quartz, calcite ( Fig. 4 C–E). Meanwhile, there is also breccia-type ore developed on the edge of the intrusion in somewhere. All these are important characterization of mineralizing fluid boils. Multiple boiling events are well characterized by the occurrence of multistage brecciated ores and wide range of boiling temperatures ( Roedder, 1971; William and Nash, 1974; Calagari, 2004 ). At the beginning of each shattering event, fluid inclusions were trapped with relatively low salinity (unsaturated). As the boiling process continued, the liquid phase became increasingly more saline. Hence, successive generations of halite-bearing inclusions were trapped. Fractures or hydraulic fractures were healed by the precipitation of quartz and sulfides. As a result of choking of the fluid conduits, permeability was reduced and the ascending fluids experienced lithostatic pressure once again. By rising internal pressure of the fluid, another episode of shattering and concomitant release of fluid and boiling took place. In summary, we believe that there may have been two different kinds of immiscibility during the whole evolution process from the magmatic crystallization differentiation to hydrothermal mineralization in the Yinan Au–Cu–Fe deposit. The early immiscibility of magma melt and the vapor–liquid phase fluids led to the unmixing and separation of ore-bearing water–gas hydrothermal fluids; while the later immiscibility (boiling) of vapor- and liquid-components resulted in the precipitation and enrichment of gold, copper and iron. 6 Conclusion The Yinan Au–Cu–Fe deposit is a typical skarn deposit produced in the contact zone between the Yanshanian intermediate-acidic intrusive rocks and the Neoarchean–Cambrian strata. H–O isotope studies have shown that, the ore-forming fluids of early unhydrous skarn stage (I) and hydrous skarn-magnetite stage (II) were mainly derived from magmatic water; while late quartz-sulfide stage (III) and carbonate stage (IV) indicated the fluids were dominantly magmatic origin with a component of meteoric water. The fluid inclusion studies have shown that, the early skarn minerals were formed from an immiscible mixture of silicate melt and vapor–liquid phase fluids. This immiscibility directly led to the ore-bearing gas–water hydrothermal fluids separating out from the magmatic system, laying the material foundation for the later hydrothermal mineralization; at the later hydrothermal stage, the immiscibility (boiling) occurred in ore-forming fluids as an indicator of the vapor and liquid phase separation. Furthermore, the decompression and boiling may occur repeatedly, thus resulting in a large number of precipitations and enrichment of gold, copper and iron.

Along the southeastern boundary of the Carboneras fault, Burdigalian marls and tuffs, mark the beginning of the volcanic episode, rest unconformably on the basement, and were tilted to the vertical during the earliest stages of movement on the fault zone. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of hornblende grains and igneous clasts from the tuffs constrain the onset of the volcanic episode at 21 Ma, some 4 Ma earlier than previously reported. Volcanic rocks higher in the sequence that overstep unconformably onto the southern edge of the fault zone yielded an age of 11 Ma, thus constraining the earliest episode of motion on the fault zone between these age limits. The main phase of left-lateral strike-slip movement on the Carboneras fault may be later than this time. Movements on more northerly strands of the fault zone, including the uplift of the Sierra Cabrera basement block to the NW, continued at least through Pliocene times. The onset of volcanism is broadly coeval with the unroofing of the orogen by extensional collapse, and supports earlier inferences of very rapid rates of uplift and cooling of the basement rocks.",,

 eastern part of the Tyrol, Austria, provides an example for deposition on a compartmentalized, narrow, microtidal to low-mesotidal,
 wave-dominated, mixed siliciclastic-carbonate shelf. The shelf was situated in front of a mainland with a relatively high,
 articulated relief, and underwent distinct changes in facies architecture mainly as a result of tectonism.
 
 The investigated succession was deposited above a deeply incised, articulated truncation surface that formed when the Eo-Alpine
 orogen, including the area of the future Northern Calcareous Alps, was uplifted and subaerially eroded. Distinct facies associations
 were deposited from (1) alluvial fans and fan deltas, (2) rivers, (3) siliciclastic lagoonal to freshwater marsh environments,
 (4) areally/temporally limited carbonate lagoons, (5) transgressive shores, (6) siliciclastic shelf environments, and (7)
 an aggrading carbonate shelf. During the Turonian to Coniacian, the combination of high rates of both subsidence and sediment
 accumulation, and a narrow shelf that was compartmentalized with respect to (a) morphology of the substratum, (b) fluviatile
 input of siliciclastics and contemporaneous input of carbonate clasts from fan deltas, (c) deposition of shallow-water carbonates,
 and (d) water energy and-depth gave rise to an exceptionally wide spectrum of facies as a distinguishing feature of the succession.
 With the exception of facies association 7, which formed only once, depositional sequences in the Turonian to Coniacian interval
 contain all of the facies associations 1 to 6. During Turonian to Coniacian times, the shelf was microtidal to low-mesotidal,
 and was dominated by waves, storm waves and storm-induced currents. In vegetated marshes, schizohaline to freshwater marl
 lakes existed. Transgressions occurred onto fan deltas and in association with estuaries, or in association with gravelly
 to rocky shores. The transgressive successions, including successions deposited from transgressive rocky carbonate shores,
 are overlain by regressive successions of shelf carbonates or shelf siliciclastics. Deposition of shallow-water carbonates
 generally occurred within lagoons and over short intervals of time. A „catch-up” succession of shelf carbonates about 100
 m thick accumulated only in an area protected from siliciclastic input.
 
 
 
 In its preserved parts, the Turonian to Coniacian succession does not record deposition adjacent to major active faults. Lateral
 changes in thickness result mainly from onlap onto the articulated basal truncation surface. Subsidence most probably was
 controlled by major detachment faults outside the outcrop area, and/or was distributed over a wide area in association with
 secondary faults above the major detachments.
 
 
 
 During Coniacian to Early Santonian times, both the older substratum and the overlying Turonian-Coniacian succession were
 subaerially exposed, faulted and deeply eroded. The following Early Santonian transgression ensued with rocky carbonate shores
 ahead of a sandy, narrow shoreface-inner shelf environment and a deeper shelf with intermittentlydysaerobic mud. The transgression
 was associated with the influx of cooler and/or nutrient-rich waters, and heralds an overall deepening. Still during the Early
 Santonian, the deepening was interrupted by another phase of subaerial exposure. Subsequently, a short phase of shelf deposition
 was terminated by deepening into bathyal depths.

Two stations were located in a slough (Taylor Slough 1, Taylor Slough 2) and four stations in the marl prairies of the Rocky Glades (Long Pine Key 7, Long Pine Key 8, Pa-hay-okee, Chekika). During the period of investigation, Taylor Slough sites had the longest hydroperiods, together with Pa-hay-okee, which is located near the eastern edge of Shark River Slough. Long Pine Key 7 and Long Pine Key 8 had the shortest hydroperiods, and Chekika had an intermediate hydroperiod. The pineland edge sites in the southern Rocky Glades (Long Pine Key) had higher numbers of individuals, and high percentages of larval stages, especially at the end of the wet season. The pineland ecotone is morphologically very heterogeneous, with solution holes in the limestone bedrock that provide below-ground refugia when there is no water on the marsh surface. The slough stations had the lowest numbers of individuals, as well as Chekika in the Rocky Glades, probably as a consequence of the altered water quality and hydropatterns caused by water management structures and operations We collected two species of calanoids, 18 cyclopoids, and three harpacticoids. The most abundant species were Acanthocyclops robustus, Tropocyclops prasinus mexicanus, Arctodiaptomus floridanus, Mesocyclops americanus, Macrocyclops albidus, Osphranticum labronectum, Microcyclops varicans, Microcyclops rubellus, Eucyclops conrowae, and Mesocyclops edax. Of these species, T. prasinus mexicanus and A. floridanus seemed to be adapted to short-hydroperiod habitats, M. rubellus and M. varicans to longer hydroperiod habitats, and E. conrowae to high conductivity habitats. Acanthocyclops robustus, M. albidus, and O. labronectum were dominant regardless of hydroperiod. As regards the temporal distribution, A. robustus was abundant throughout the entire wet season, M. edax, M. rubellus, M. americanus and M. varicans were most abundant in mid-wet season, in September–October, and T. prasinus mexicanus, M. albidus, and E. conrowae were abundant late in the wet season, in winter.

We also analyzed the precipitates found close to the main drainage pipes. The hydrogeochemical study allowed us to identify a main NaOH water facies for the many samples collected close to the tunnel. In addition, the correlation diagrams highlighted high concentrations of Na, K, and Al, unrelated to simple water- rock interaction. Further evaluation excluded the possibility that interaction between the water and the outcropping lithologies was the only cause of the ongoing processes. This consideration is supported by the high Na and K concentrations, which cannot be accounted for by interaction between water and calcareous marl. Excluding a natural origin and some anthropogenic factors, one possible explanation is an interaction between the groundwater and the mortars used for consolidation during the excavation phase of the tunnel. Mortar and concrete degradation in aqueous environments produces a great increase in pH, initially deriving from interstitial fluids containing strong alkali (NaOH and KOH) and non-negligible K and Na concentrations, such as we observed in the collected samples.",,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/636/132/556/5c757d01f56def9798a9790c_0.pdf
61c8f8265244ab9dcbccbd1f,"Whole Lithospheric Folding as a Mechanism of Basin Formation and Tectonic Implications for Gondwana Evolution: Evidence from the Palmyride Trough, #30176 (2011)",,[{'name': 'Barry  Wood'}],"Data from the Palmyride Trough of Syria do not support a rift origin of this intra-plate basin. The trough has filled with six successor basins since the late Paleozoic, each basin sequence consisting of low energy, shallow water sediments recording cyclical drowning and drying. Late cycle and inter-cycle regional erosion and volcanism suggest a tectonic influence on cycle termination and basin renewal. New isocore maps show a narrowing of nested troughs through time, increasing structural segmentation and regional counterclockwise rotation. Lithospheric folding is proposed for trough initiation in the late Palaeozoic with subsequent cyclical deposition, exposure and deformation occurring as a reaction to a naturally occurring decrease in the underlying fold wavelength and regional rotation. Shortening across the basin since the late Paleozoic has been minor, probably less than 20-30 kilometres. Basin longevity, stratigraphic history and limited shortening preclude the view that formation and deformation of the Palmyride trough occurred solely during Tertiary left-lateral movement on the Levant Fracture. An alternate mechanism is needed. Although not often considered contiguous, Egypt and Syria share a common late Paleozoic and Mesozoic structural and sedimentary history. It is proposed that this greater Eastern Mediterranean Basin formed as a lithospheric, compressional downwarp during the disintegration of Gondwana and a single, constant, unidirectional, far-field force from the southeast best explains the compression and subsequent narrowing and counter clockwise rotation of successor basins. There is no need to introduce constantly changing stress fields through time to account for local and regional patterns. Independent support for this new tectonic model comes from the rotational history of Afro-Arabia derived from the study of magnetic stripping of the surrounding Mesozoic oceans which matches that derived from the rotation of Palmyride Trough successor basins. Copyright © AAPG. Serial rights given by author. For all other rights contact author directly. Gondwana partitioning by northwest oriented rifting, sedimentation in plate-scale northeast oriented compressional downwarps and a history of continental scale counter clockwise rotation, all driven by a constant, far-field, northwest oriented force, fits regional geologic and structural patterns across the present day African and Arabian plates. Understanding regional deformation through time allows for prediction of sedimentation patterns from tectonic to local scale. Rethinking Palmyride Basin Geology The Palmyride Mountains of west central Syria are topographically separate from the Anti-Lebanon Mountains. These highlands consist of a series of individual north-northeast elongated ranges, rising to 1000-1200 m and resting on a broad elevated mass oriented east-northeast. Middle Cretaceous rocks crop out on the crestal areas while the flanks expose a succession of upper Cretaceous to Miocene rocks. Very attenuated lower Mesozoic and upper Palaeozoic successions scarcely outcrop and therefore can only be investigated using seismic and well data. The surface expression of the Palmyride Mountains belies the full extent of the underlying Palmyride Trough (Figure 1) that consists in the subsurface of a Central Uplift and two flanking catchments, the Addaw and Homs depressions. The Homs Depression to the northwest is a 30-40 km wide flat plain covered in Miocene marls and younger gravels. The emergence of Paleocene rocks further northwest is evidence of the thinning of the underlying sedimentary section onto the Aleppo High and well data such as Khanaser-1 further northeast, with a strongly attenuated Mesozoic section, solidifies the concept. The Addaw Depression to the southeast, effectively a perched valley elevated some 200-300 m above the Rutbah High further southeast, like its counterpart to the northwest, is a broad flat plain of young gravels. Unlike the subtle northwest margin of the Homs Depression, the Southern Palmyride Mountains mark the boundary between the Addaw Depression and the Rutbah High. They encompass a series of left-stepping, elongated ridges extending from southwest of Damascus to Palmyra where they converge on the Central Uplift. As in the Central Uplift, middle Cretaceous carbonates outcrop on the crests of each ridge with the underlying Mesozoic and upper Palaeozoic showing, on seismic, strong attenuation toward the southeast. Individual ridges, rising from 800-900 m, are box-folded structures cored with Triassic evaporites, the flanks of which show complicated small-scale thrusting with either limb overturned (Searle, 1994). Their formation related to detachment along an underlying evaporitic surface can generally be confirmed, however the timing and mechanism of structuring have been the subject of discussion (Seber et al., 1993). Further southeast, the Rutbah High is an area of very thin Mesozoic and upper Paleozoic. The Palmyride Trough and related structures form part of a linear belt, the Syrian Arc (Krenkel, 1924), extending from central Egypt into northeast Syria. The continuity of this extensive intraplate system was broken by the north-northeast oriented, left-lateral strikeslip Levant Fault System in the Miocene. Movement since has critically altered the configuration of the arc through the region of the Lebanese and Anti-Lebanon Mountains, but to what extent has been a long-standing open discussion (Walley, 1998). The intent of this paper is three fold. First, to describe the structural and stratigraphic development of the intraplate Palmyride Trough itself, second, to build a tectonic model for the intraplate deformation of the north west Arabian Plate, and third, to extend the model to plate-scale deformation. A thorough examination of data from in excess of 90 wells and 3000+ km of high quality seismic resulted in the construction of several isocore maps of selected stratigraphic intervals and palaeogeographic maps of these same intervals allows for an in-depth look at the development of the Palmyride Trough through time. While it is beyond the scope of this abstract to present all the findings, enough will be presented to justify the conclusions. The geology indicates that the trough is not and never has been a rift and this opens the discussion as to how it formed and what the implications are for regional tectonics. Observations Figure 2 and Figure 3 demonstrate the stratigraphic fill of the trough and offer a two dimensional view of the basic components and construction of the trough. The construction of the stratigraphic column demonstrates the presence of unconformities of very long duration separating the trough into six stacked basins (Cycles I–VI) equivalent to second-order cycles of the Tethyan Super Cycle. These inter-basin unconformities are confirmed by seismic and paleontological data. Each sediment package (basin) is composed entirely of low energy deposits. Sediment type distribution demonstrates that basins are not erratic erosional remnants as deeper water deposits coincide with maximum thickness contours of isocore maps of individual units. Further, dating of regional volcanic activity (Figure 4) confirms the inter-basin time gaps were coincident with volcanism in the immediate and peripheral regions suggesting episodic periods of upheaval separated by deposition of low energy and shallow water sediments (Wilson et al., 1998), Structurally, no trough parallel, marginal, down-to-the-basin normal faulting occurred at any time during the sediment expanding smoothly into a simple syncline. These observations contradict most of the literature on the origin of the Palmyride Trough, that the basin has been an intracratonic rift since perhaps as long ago as the early Paleozoic (Litak et al., 1997), and begged a deeper review. Rethinking Basin Genesis To investigate a compression model of deformation, geological cross sections of individual basins were constructed; shortening is clear as is basin scale folding, with younger folding appearing to display progressively higher frequency, i.e., a shorter wave-train across the basin (approximately 50 to 70 kms during the Jurassic). Most striking is the migration of basin depocentres toward the northwest coincident with uplift of the southeast flank (the Rutbah High). Lateral compression is very clear on seismic (Figure 6) where internal box folding has compensated for severe shortening in a northwest by southeast direction. Basin crowding and space deprivation fit with compression on a tectonic scale. Timing of folding can be well controlled by noting on-lap sequences on seismic (Chaimov et al., 1992). When their claim is compared to stratigraphic evidence that similar uplifts (folds?) are developing as far away as northern Egypt (Figure 7; Kuss et al., 2000; Wood, 1998), the regional aspect of basin formation begins to emerge. That each cycle of basin formation and filling was followed by destruction coincident with trough narrowing and internal structuring prior to filling successor basins, suggests the formation of the basin has been derived in compression not extension. Implicit is trough formation by compressional folding of the entire substratum and, considering the full basin width of 250-300 kms represents one wavelength, was probably of lithospheric proportion. To test the idea, a series of flattened trough-wide geological sections were constructed then simplified into a two-dimensional deformation model (Figure 8). The northwest migration of the nested basins of the trough suggest that a northwest force was active much further back in time than the Alpine Orogeny, the timing most often cited as the only time of compression of northwest Arabia (Litak et al., 1997). Basin crowding (shortening) also infers that there was resistance to plate migration to the northwest throughout the formation of the Palmyride Trough, further inferring a massive “backsto",,

CALCAREOUS NANNOFOSSILS IN THE BASAL ZANCLEAN OF THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEA: REMARKS ON PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND SAPROPEL FORMATION 1,,"[{'id': '53f374aadabfae4b349ccbe2', 'name': 'Davide Castradori'}]","This paper presents the results of a study on nannofossil assemblages in the uppermost Messinian and basal Zanclean sedi- ments recovered from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Holes 969B (south of Crete) and 967A (north of the Eratosthenes Sea- mount) located in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Focus of the research is on (1) the micropaleontological signature of the basically nonmarine facies of the uppermost Messinian interval; (2) the correlation of the Messinian/Zanclean boundary outside the Mediterranean by means of nannofossil biostratigraphy; and (3) the mechanism of sapropel formation in the earliest Pliocene. The main results are summarized as follows: 1. The Messinian sediments are characterized by assemblages dominated by diagenetic resistant and long-ranging Neogene species, absence of typical upper Tortonian-Messinian species, high abundance of reworked taxa of Cenozoic and Cretaceous age, and high abundance of gypsum crystals and dolomite. All evidence listed above point to the absence of a primary marine signature in the nannofossil assemblages of the sediments. A noticeable exception, constituted by anomalous abundance of Sphenolithus spp., which suggests a possible (marginal) marine signature, is documented. 2. The recovery of some specimens of Triquetrorhabdulus rugosus and of Ceratolithus acutus overlapping each other in the basal Zanclean suggests that, contrary to what has been reported by most authors, the last appearance datum (LAD) of T. rugo- sus and the first appearance datum (FAD) of C. acutus do not exactly coincide. This was already reported from the Ceara Rise (ODP Leg 154), where the FAD of C. acutus was found immediately below the cyclostratigraphically correlated position of the Messinian/Zanclean boundary. These closely spaced bioevents can be considered as a valuable tool, in addition to magneto- stratigraphy and astrocyclostratigraphy, for the recognition and worldwide traceability of the Messinian/Zanclean boundary. 3. Based on a model by Molfino and McIntyre, fluctuation in abundance of Florisphaera profunda, a peculiar nannoplank- ton species living in the lower part of the photic zone, is interpreted to represent nutrient availability within different lev els of the photic zone. Thus, positive peaks of F. profunda were connected by the author to the presence of a deep chlorophyll maxi- mum (DCM) at times of sapropel formation, a concept previously introduced by Rohling and Gieskes for the mid-Pleistocene to Holocene time interval. Abundance peaks of Florisphaera profunda are recorded in all five sapropel layers recovered in the basal Zanclean of ODP Hole 969B. Therefore, the DCM model may be tentatively applied also to the earliest Pliocene and probably to the whole sapropel sequence of the Mediterranean area, since the late Miocene. The recovery of abundance peaks of Discoaster pentaradiatus in most sapropels (together with the decreased abundance of Coccolithus pelagicus in some of them), suggests that these sapropels probably correlate with the marls (and not the lime- stones) of the rhythmically bedded sedimentary sequences of the land sections in Sicily and Calabria (southern Italy), thus con - firming previous assumptions by De Visser, Hilgen, and others.",,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/823/1313/160/53e99b8db7602d9702435003_0.pdf
6229bc015aee126c0f9885dc,Evaluation criteria for Paleozoic effective hydrocarbon source rocks,,"[{'name': 'Zhang Da-jiang', 'org': 'PetroChina', 'orgs': ['PetroChina']}]","One of the focal points for geochemically assessing marine carbonate rocks for a long time in China is how to identify the threshold value of organic enrichment of efficient hydrocarbon source rocks. Some of the considerable views from Chinese authors spur people to believe that the carbonate rocks with TOC content low down to 0.1 % (wt. ) still could be as efficient source rocks. These views are as follows: (1) non-reservoir carbonate rocks typically contain less organic matter than shales but have higher hydrocarbon conversion, therefore, carbonate should have less critical source rock threshold value; (2) low organic enrichment in the present carbonate rocks in China is as a result of higher levels of thermal maturity, and so sample's initial characteristics should be recovered; and (3) the huge thickness of a sedimentary rock can compensate for low levels of organic enrichment. However, subsequent studies including many practical exploration investigations and laboratory simulation experiments do not completely support these views above. The carbonate rocks with TOC content low to 0. 1 % - 0.2%( wt. ) could not absolutely be as potential and/or efficient source rocks. Otherwise, hydrocarbon source rocks are largely ubiquitous and should never be a major limiting factor within exploratory programs. The organic-rich rocks within marine stratigraphic intervals or marine carbonates should mainly be shale, mudstone, marl and micrite limestone instead of pure carbonate. Geochemical studies have shown that (1) the same types of organic matter have similar hydrocarbon yield and no the case that carbonate source rocks have higher conversion than that of mudstone; (2) generation and expulsion process of hydrocarbon could generally not cause the organic enrichment down obviously for those rocks containing less 1. 0% (wt. ) of organic carbon content deposited in epicontinental sea environment; and (3) expulsion efficiency decreases with increasing gross source rock thickness. Therefore, it is concluded that threshold value of organic enrichment for a carbonate petroleum source rock could not below that for shale (0. 5 % (wt. TOC)), and threshold should be independent of source rock lithology. Efficient source rocks need not too large in thickness, but must contain higher organic enrichment ( 0. 5% (wt.

From 1600-1870 m (asl) a sandy, loamy gravel is found in different sediment traps, as caves, hollows, dolines and waterless runs (Fig. 1). The largest outcrop lies in a line of hollows and runs in a length of about 1 km between Oberberg and Wagenmoos (Coord. 629.375/177.875). A 2 m deep profile not reaching the bedrock shows an unlayered, compact sediment under 50 cm of Braunerde. It looks like a mudflow, in no way adjusted and woozily poured. Half of the pebbles are non- rounded sandstones and marls originating from the nearby Hohgant-Formation. The other half is well rounded, consisting of various limestones indicating a fluvial transport. Among them 3-5% of crystalline and metamorphic material can be found: granite, gneiss, mica, amphibolite, a lot of quartz, quartzite and a few ophiolites like serpentinite. In this context there are two questions, which are of high interest: where does this sediment originate and which process did remove it at this place? Former authors (Minet 1971, Jeannin 1989) considered them as (fluvio)-glacial sediments. But at first sight there is no evidence for glacial transport. The sediment doesn't look like lodgement till: it's not matrix supported, not adjusted and fissures of unloading, scratched pebbles and erratic boulders are missing. Furthermore any characteristic petrography for Aare- or Rhone-Glacier, as Aare-Granite, Grimsel-Granodiorite, Mont-Blanc-Granit, Allalin-Gabbro, Arkesin or Vallorcine-Konglomerat, is absent too. A direct fluvial deposit in this karst plateau is impossible, as there are usually no streams. Most of the outcrops are located in caves. The sediment appears already in the oldest part of the Sieben-Hengste-Hohgant cave-system (the uppermost part). First results by burial-age dating let assume a minimal age of the first sedimentation of about 2 Ma (pers. comm. Philipp Häuselmann). The two detected deposits on the surface lie along faults. Two interesting details of the Wagenmoos outcrop attract attention. At the southern margin large boulders of a collapsed sandstone bank slightly out of place are found. At the northern margin a little stream has its source in the swamp of Wagennoos. It's eroding the sediment and transporting it into the doline nearby: the next deeper sedimentation level. The boulders out of place seem to indicate a former, now unroofed cave system along the visible fault. As to the crystalline petrography, we find hardly an analogy in the Aarmassif. Especially for the serpentinites there is no equivalent. Some of the granites, gneisses",,

We examined one such outcrop, the Triassic platform flank of Picco di Vallandro (Durrenstein) in northern Italy to develop criteria for recognizing false lap-out patterns. Using measured sections, photo mosaics of the continuous outcrop, and petrophysical measurements on samples, two contrasting impedance models were constructed. One model, supported by field observation, shows interfingering between basin marls and slope carbonates. The second model shows onlap of basin marls against slope carbonates, but with similar overall geometries to the first model. Vertical incidence seismic models were produced at frequencies between 50 and 150 Hz and with displays of seismic amplitude, as well as two seismic attributes-instantaneous phase and reflection strength. At 50 Hz, the two lithologic models are seismically indistinguishable, both showing onlap of basin units onto the slope. At 90 Hz, displays of instantaneous phase begin to reveal the stratigraphic interfingering, whereas seismic amplitude displays require frequencies of 150 Hz to do so. Reflection strength accurately portrays the distribution of the two major facies in the entire range of examined frequencies, but does not show sufficient detail to reveal interfingering vs. onlap. The same trends were visible with finite difference modeling of the full waveform. Here, the differences between interfingering and onlap become visible at 150 Hz in the phase model, where seismic amplitude displays at this frequency are still ambiguous. The phase model, however, fails to differentiate between slope dip and the basin sediment wedge, whereas this wedge is clearly mapped by the reflection strength. A combination of instantaneous phase and reflection strength provides a decisive advantage over conventional amplitude displays in recognizing rapid facies changes in seismic reflection data.",,

In this paper, the two main dune systems are mapped according to their geomorphological, sedimentological and dynamic characteristics, and their significance is discussed with regard to the environmental changes since the Late Pleistocene, both at time of the former lake and during the drier periods of the Holocene. Cross-sections show the relationship of the dunes to the topography of the basement. Analyses of the sand fraction show distinct characteristics in size distribution, quartz and shell contents, wind erosion effects on the quartz grains and petrographic composition. Interpretation of the results, coupled with information provided by the geomorphology of the dune systems studied in the field and from aerial photographs and satellite images, highlights the importance and variations in time of local factors such as prevailing winds, sand sources, changes in lake levels and vegetation. A chronology of the main sand fields is proposed, based on the evidence of three main droughts during the Upper Pleistocene. The older one, much eroded (maximum height = 3 m), covers a limestone surface at + 50 m above the bottom of the dried lake. An Optical Scanning Luminescence (OSL) date shows a last period of accumulation at 14,328 +/- 3220 years. The younger one (maximum height = 12 m) has moved over the emerged Late Pleistocene lacustrine marls. An OSL date gives an age of 5674 +/- 988 years for the last accumulation period. Evidence of very recent activation of this younger dune system is apparent as a result of overgrazing and excessive land reclamation. A third period of dominant wind action and dune construction is responsible for the installation of a younger and thin dune field over the Mid-Holocene lacustrine deposits of the Karapinar lake. The success of the stabilization programme of the dunes over the last 30 years shows that the last period of dune movement is not related to climate change but to overpressure on the land due to the needs and activities of an increasing population.

Sediments of the Lower and Middle Triassic Sherwood Sandstone Group are exposed at the crest of the horst whilst its flanks are capped by sediments of the Mercia Mudstone Group. Extensive diagenesis and porosity modification have taken place in the Sherwood Sandstone across the Alderley Horst.Diagenetic modification includes reduction of hematite grain coatings and quartz cementation, together with Cu-Pb-Zn-Fe sulphide and barite mineralization. The distribution of this cementation is spatially related to faults that cross the horst and its style and extent varies between individual faults and between fault sets of different orientations. Different spatial distributions are observed for quartz cements, barite, sulphides, ferroan calcite, reduction of hematite grain coatings and secondary ore concentrations. Sandstone units close to the base of the Mercia Mudstone Group are more intensely altered than lower units showing that hematite reduction and mineralization are concentrated at the crest of the horst.Fault-related mineralization and porosity modification post-dates all of the fault movement as brecciation and deformation of barite and sulphide cements are not observed. The intensity of mineralization decreases at structurally lower levels on the WNW-ESE oriented faults, so precluding them as conduits for the vertical migration of mineralizing fluids. However, the horst-bounding Kirkleyditch Fault was probably an important migration pathway that enabled valving of fluids from dowthrown sources in the Mercia Mudstone Group, Manchester Marls and Carboniferous shales, although the possiblity of fluid migration up-dip from the south cannot be completely discounted. The mineralizing fluids were ponded at the crest of the horst where they were baffled by pre-existing structural barriers.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/22/86/3A/22863A36CBCB1F6893BB23FB3C869D99.pdf

L1 consists of limestone and L6 consists of limestone and intercalated shale / argillite. Within the wedge, the basal structural level (L2) consists of calcareous marls displaying pillow-like structures due to a layer-parallel anastomosed foliation, and evaporite, shale and chert displaying m-scale mushrooms; level L3 consists of evaporite and shale displaying cm- to dm-scale features like normal and thrust faults, folds, foliation and boudins; level L4 consists of evaporite and shale transformed into a tectonic melange; and level L5 consists of evaporite and limestone affected by m-scale folds, contraction and extension faults. Intensive fracturing of the layers around the hinges of the folds transformed L5 in a set of Broken Beds, The wedge deformed progressively, as it slided above a top-down to the west basal detachment along levels L3 and L4, and below a bottom-down to the west detachment established along a layer of calcareous shale (bottom of level L6). The structural analysis, together with other published data, all indicate that an event of extension affected regionally the area, earlier in the Alpine inversion of the Wessex Basin, during which the entire set of rocks tilted to the north and further slip occurred within the Broken Beds.

Ali 50 INTRODUCTION The Akri-Bijeel Block covers an area of 889 Km 2 . From a topographic standpoint, the block is divided into a northern part characterized by an E – W trend of mountain series with heights reaching 1,500 m above sea level, and a southern part which is a gentle hilly, plateaulike area, with a height of 500 m above sea level in general (Csontos et al., 2011). Abdula et al. (2017) used Rock-Eval pyrolysis to examine the petroleum source potential of rock samples from the Bijeel 1 Well, Akri-Bijeel Block in Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq. Their results show that the Sargelu and Sehkaniyan formations contain marine Type IIS kerogen and are potential sources of hydrocarbons. The organic matter is thermally mature with respect to the oil window. In the samples they have studied, carbonates are more organic-rich and more oil-prone than carbonaceous shales and silty mudstones, which appear to be potential sources of natural gas. The Bekhme-1 Well was drilled as an exploratory/ wild cat. It is located in the southern part of Akri-Bijeel Block in the northern part of Iraq, in the High Folded Zone. Bekhme-1 Well is situated about 10 Km to the north of Harir town, 50 Km north of the regional capital city, Erbil. It lies on latitude 36° 40' 33.05'' N and longitude 44° 17' 47.60'' E (Fig.1). As part of an additional effort, we have studied cuttings from the Bekhme-1 exploratory well that was drilled along the northern margin of the Akri-Bijeel Block. Samples from the Jurassic formations were analyzed using Rock-Eval pyrolysis in order to better understand the potential of petroleum source rocks in the block. This paper reports the results of hydrocarbon source rock characterization of Jurassic formations of interest within the Bekhme-1 Well namely, Chia Gara, Naokelekan, Sargelu, Sehkaniyan, and Sarki formations. Fig.1: Location map showing the studied well Iraqi Bulletin of Geology and Mining Vol.14, No.2, 2018 p 49  59 51 GEOLOGICAL SETTING Iraq forms the northeastern part of the Arabian Plate and the stratigraphy of the country is strongly affected by its structural position within the main geostructural units of the Middle East region. Akri-Bijeel area is located in the NNE of Iraq at the boundary between the Arabian part of the African Platform (Nubian-Arabian) and the Asian branches of the Alpine Tectonic Belt (Al-Juboury, 2009). From Bijeel anticline towards Akri and Bakrman (Fig.2) it is quite common to find steep southerly dipping strata in the Mesozoic section on the southern limb of the anticline. A lot of thrust exposures were found at the southern limbs, and one at the northern limb, which suggest that thrusts underlie the limbs of these major folds (Csontos et al., 2012; Abdula et al., 2017). The available geological and geophysical data (Fig.2) indicate that the Akri-Bijeel Block includes Cenozoic marine and non-marine Cretaceous carbonate and marl strata that are more than 1.4 Km thick which, in turn, rest conformably on the Jurassic marine sedimentary strata (~0.8 Km thick) (Fig.3). The Bekhme-1 well reached a total depth of 4560 m in hard formations and it was sampled from about 1158 to 2290 m with a generally good recovery, but the well-log history indicates that some of the cutting runs had incomplete or no recovery. Fig.2: Detailed geological map of the area. The two major anticlines displaying Mesozoic formations in the north correspond to the Akri (western) and the Bekhme (Eastern) anticlines (modified from Csontos et al., 2012) METHODOLOGY Thirty four samples were collected from the Bekhme-1 Well at different depths and different spacing ranges. The samples were stored at the Geological Survey Office in Erbil, Kurdistan, Region. The collected samples represent the different lithologies of the Chia Gara, Naokelekan, Sargelu, Sehkaniyan, and Sarki formations which are commonly composed of limestone and shale (Fig.3). Detailed information on the laboratory procedures of Rock-Eval pyrolysis, as well as guidelines for interpreting the results of these analyses, can be found in publications by Peters (1986) and Peters and Cassa (1994). The analyses were conducted at Kurdistan Institution for Strategic Studies and Scientific Research (KISSR), in Sulaymaniyah Governorate, Kurdistan Region. Thirty four representative samples were analyzed by Rock Geochemical Evaluation of Organic Matter in Jurassic Source Rocks, Bekhme-1 Well, Erbil Governorate, Kurdstan Region, Iraq Muhammed A. Ali 52 Eval pyrolysis. The measured parameters included S1 (mg HC/g rock), S2 (mg HC/g rock), Tmax (°C), and TOC (wt.%) (Table 1). Additional parameters, such as Hydrogen Index (HI = S2/TOC*100), Production Index {PI = S1/ (S1+S2)}, and vitrinite reflectance, are calculated from these measured values (Table 1).

NNE-trending basins formed during the Early-Middle Miocene period as exemplified by the Oren and Yatagan grabens. These graben fills consist of three distinct rock units. At the base are (1) coarse clastics, sourced from elevated areas adjacent to the basin-bounding faults. These are linear river-valley fills. They give way upward to (2) alternating coal-bearing sandstone and limestone as the graben valleys were gradually widened, and the surrounding mountains were reduced by erosion. Finally, lake environment formed, invading the region during the advanced stage of graben development. In the lakes were deposited (3) extensive marls and limestones. The lake deposits gradually onlapped the graben shoulders. The NE-trending grabens extend SW toward the shore of the SW-NE-trending Kale-Tavas basin. The lake and the sea basin were apparently connected as evidenced by several marine incursions from the south into the Oren basin. The marine units wedge out to the north. On the graben shoulders, the Lower-Middle Miocene sediments were overlain unconformably by red, brown coarse clastic sediments as linear and axial fluvial deposits during Late Miocene time when N-S extensional tectonics began. Under this tectonic regime, some of the N-S-trending faults were reactived as oblique-slip faults with a dip-slip component. Later, the fluvial deposits were replaced by sediments of a new lake environment, in which extensive lacustrine limestones were deposited. The extents of the lakes were regional, stretching far beyond the limits of the grabens. The E-W-trending faults bordering the northern margin of the Gokova graben cut and postdate the Upper Miocene-Lower Pliocene lacustrine units. The Lower to Upper Miocene sequences were elevated on the graben shoulders. Along the northern edge of Gokova graben, more than 400 m of coarse fluvial conglomerates and debris were formed in front of this elevated region. The Gokova graben, mostly offshore, is about 150-km-long and enlarges westward from 5 to 30 km. The western margin of the graben rises steeply to over 1000 m, but the southern margin is less marked. The coastline has many bays and small offshore islands.",,
6229bc015aee126c0f9885dc,Evaluation criteria for Paleozoic effective hydrocarbon source rocks,,"[{'name': 'Zhang Da-jiang', 'org': 'PetroChina', 'orgs': ['PetroChina']}]","One of the focal points for geochemically assessing marine carbonate rocks for a long time in China is how to identify the threshold value of organic enrichment of efficient hydrocarbon source rocks. Some of the considerable views from Chinese authors spur people to believe that the carbonate rocks with TOC content low down to 0.1 % (wt. ) still could be as efficient source rocks. These views are as follows: (1) non-reservoir carbonate rocks typically contain less organic matter than shales but have higher hydrocarbon conversion, therefore, carbonate should have less critical source rock threshold value; (2) low organic enrichment in the present carbonate rocks in China is as a result of higher levels of thermal maturity, and so sample's initial characteristics should be recovered; and (3) the huge thickness of a sedimentary rock can compensate for low levels of organic enrichment. However, subsequent studies including many practical exploration investigations and laboratory simulation experiments do not completely support these views above. The carbonate rocks with TOC content low to 0. 1 % - 0.2%( wt. ) could not absolutely be as potential and/or efficient source rocks. Otherwise, hydrocarbon source rocks are largely ubiquitous and should never be a major limiting factor within exploratory programs. The organic-rich rocks within marine stratigraphic intervals or marine carbonates should mainly be shale, mudstone, marl and micrite limestone instead of pure carbonate. Geochemical studies have shown that (1) the same types of organic matter have similar hydrocarbon yield and no the case that carbonate source rocks have higher conversion than that of mudstone; (2) generation and expulsion process of hydrocarbon could generally not cause the organic enrichment down obviously for those rocks containing less 1. 0% (wt. ) of organic carbon content deposited in epicontinental sea environment; and (3) expulsion efficiency decreases with increasing gross source rock thickness. Therefore, it is concluded that threshold value of organic enrichment for a carbonate petroleum source rock could not below that for shale (0. 5 % (wt. TOC)), and threshold should be independent of source rock lithology. Efficient source rocks need not too large in thickness, but must contain higher organic enrichment ( 0. 5% (wt. TOC)) intervals and have a certain distribution scope.",,

These limestones have been previously attributed to the Upper Pliensbachian (Domerian) on the supposed age of the large bivalves assemblages (mainly Opisoma, Cochlearites, Lithioperna). We have collected a Tropidoceras sp. in the bedded limestones covering the bioaccumulations with Cochlearites sp. and rare Opisoma menchikoffi. These new data indicate that these bivalve beds have been deposited from the Demonense Zone upward. The lack of ammonites prevents a more precise dating of the top of this formation. On the Bou plateau (top of the palaeo-shoal), it is overlain by condensed beds yielding Upper Toarcian and Aalenian ammonites. This change in the environment resulted from the breaking and of the sinking of the platform and it is illustrated by large fissures developed inside the shallow Pliensbachian carbonates which are filled up by Toarcian-Aalenian ammonites-bearing pink micrites. This palaeostructure is surrounded and sealed by marls and marly limestones. The Sebbab Sghrir profile indicates a succession of five foraminifera assemblages from the late Carixian to the early Bajocian. In the uppermost Calcaires du Bou Dahar, we have recognized the equivalent of the C2 and D biozones of Septfontaine [1984, 1985]. During the early Bajocian, the succession of two microfaunas, 4 and 5, is displayed. Their boundary coincides with the limit between the Concavum and Discites ammonite zones. The protoglobigerinids appearance (FAD; 5b) is linked to the structural homogeneization of the region. The Bou shoal has been previously differentiated around a Palaeozoic relief. The structural pattern consisted of E-W faults crossed by transverse NW-SE or SSW-NNE faults as it is documented by the eastern and western rapid change from the shallow platform to the open sea domain. The Toarcian and Aalenian marls onlap the shoal to the west, indicating that the palaeostructure was dissymetric.

Structural analyses and paleogeographic reconstructions from most of these high-pressure terrains indicate an eastward motion of the Apulian promontory and subduction of oceanic basins beneath the European related continental blocks. Based on the present nappe structure in the Western Carpathians, subduction of the Meliata oceanic basin and subsequent exhumation of blueschists have been interpreted to occur along the south-dipping thrusts plans that are coincident with main convergence direction of Cretaceous collision. In this contribution we present new data on a westward exhumation mechanism for the Jurassic blueschists that were overprinted by northward Cretaceous collisional processes in the Western Carpathians. The Eastern boundary of the Meliata accretionary wedge is situated along the southern margin of the West Carpathians in Slovakia and northern Hungary. It is a thrust over the crystalline basement consolidated during Variscan orogeny. The Meliata accretionary wedge is a complex stack of crustal and oceanic units, which is formed from bottom to top by: (1) Lower Thrust Sheet composed of sub-blueschist facies (8–10 kbar 350–400 °C) quartz phyllite and conglomerate of Permian age. (2) Upper Thrust Sheet consisting of blueschist facies (10-13 kbar 400450 oC) marbles with metabasites and phyllites, which are derived from Triassic oceanic materials, but some Variscan amphibolite-facies basement rocks with blueschist overprint are also part of this sheet. According to geochronological dating, the blueschist facies rocks, formed during Middle Jurassic time (156 Ma) were exhumed in time space of 125–145 Ma. (3) Very low-grade (4–6 kbar 300–350 °C) Meliata Mélange composed of Permian evaporates and Jurassic shells, marls and sandstones that contain blocks (olistoliths) of Triassic radiolarites, cherts, limestones, serpentinites, gabbros and blueschists. (4) Very lowgrade to non-metamorphosed Turna and Silica nappes derived from Apulian shelf and formed by Upper Permian – Jurassic limestones, shales, sandstones and some volcanic rocks. Structural and metamorphic evolution of the Meliata accretionary wedge is characterized by fabrics and mineral assemblages testifying HP stage, retrogression during exhumation and emplacement of thrust sheets and late shortening of whole wedge during buttressing stage. The HP deformation stage D1-2 in the Lower and Upper Thrust Sheets is manifested by development of penetrative SE dipping metamorphic fabric, bearing intense stretching lineation plunging to the southeast. The S1-2 metamorphic fabric in the Meliata mélange that related to accretionary metamorphism (Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous) is only preserved within competent Triassic marbles forming olistostromes. D3 deformation stage – buttressing is developed in all thrust units of the Meliata wedge as well as in the underlying parautochtonous Paleozoic basement. It is characterized by N-S trending buckle and striking folds and steep ESE dipping slaty or spaced axial plane cleavage. The Cretaceous overprint was a polyphase process controlled by indentation of southern block actively moving to the north. The new structural data in combination with petrologic and geochronoloogic results allow to constraint a tectonic model for exhumation that is good agreement with paleogeographic reconstructions considered for the suture zones in the Rhodop massif, Aegean Sea and in West Turkey. Our new results fit well with paleomagnetic record of Jurassic drifting and subsequent anticlockwise rotation of African plate during Cretaceous.",,

Estratigrafia y Paleontologia|Facultad de Ciencia|Universidad del Paìs Vasco'}]","The Pyrenees is proving to be a key-area to analyse many of the sedimentary and biotic changes that marked the early Paleogene evolution of warm (sub) tropical marine environments. During that time, this alpine chain formed a large intra-plate marine embayment opening towards the north Atlantic (the so-called Pyrenean basin), with a deep central depression surrounded by broad shallow-water marginal shelves on the south, east and northern sides. In the shallow areas, sedimentation was defined by carbonate platforms developing a whole range of sub-environments (beaches, tidal flats, lagoons, bioclastic accumulations and reefs), whereas (hemi)pelagic deposits (""Scaglia like"" limestone-marl alternations) with shelf-derived breccias and turbidites characterised the slope and basin domains. The remnants of both shallow and deep water successions crop out extensively along the western and south-central Pyrenees, allowing detailed sedimentological and biostratigraphic analyses and the accurate reconstruction of platform-basin sections. Three main evolutionary phases have been differentiated during that interval, each one showing a distinctive platform-basin depositional model and a characteristic range of both litho- and biofacies. The first evolutionary phase took place during the Danian and was characterised by the dominance of carbonate sedimentation on both platform and deep settings. The Danian platform succession is a 300 m-thick carbonate package interpreted as representative of a complete sequence of recovery of shallow environments after the K-P boundary.. The climax of the recovery phase is represented by the upper Danian Lizarraga complex (NP4 zone); a thick barrier-reef complex showing well-diversified coralgal assemblages that extended laterally for about 300 km. The second evolutionary phase encompassed the Selandian and Thanetian stages. It started with sea level fall evidenced in the platforms by a conspicuous karstification surface. The re- flooding of the shallow areas was a stepwise process, defined by the deposition of the Usabide and Legunbe complexes. Both units developed a characteristic ramp profile and were mainly characterised by foramol facies. The third evolutionary phase developed during earliest Eocene (early Ilerdian) times (NP10 to NP 11 Zones). In platform areas, this phase developed under widespread transgressive conditions (the so-called Ilerdian transgression) and is exemplified by foramol-dominated carbonate ramps. The rich dasycladalean assemblages illustrated herein belong to reef faces and secondly to lagoonal environment of the Lizarraga complex (upper Danian, first evolutionary phase). The reefal assemblages, dominated by Broeckella belgica Morellet & Morellet and Triploporella apenninica Baretti, show the closest similarities with those from the Western Aquitaine (Deloffre, 1980) and Sardinia (Dieni et al., 1985).",,

Our study uses seismic information with pixel-based geostatistical techniques for the construction of fine-scale geological models. This field has eleven wells in the northern region. The information of the wells reveals that the field comprises some productive areas that have ensured commercial production, however others are less productive. In order to identify those productive areas in undeveloped region, especially southern portion of the reservoir, integration of the 3D seismic information into reservoir descriptions is necessary. Our approach follows a four-step procedure. First, log data are correlated to core-measured porosity using the Alternating Conditional Expectation (ACE) algorithm. Second, more than 20 seismic attributes are investigated to specify relationships with well porosity. Third, fine-scale geological models are created based on well data and two seismic attributes with the Markov Bayes and cloud transform techniques. Finally, course-scale flow simulation models are generated by a scale-up technique for history matching purposes. An excellent history matching is achieved without any history match tunings. The prediction results obtained from fifty realizations indicate that the development of the southwestern portion is economically feasible. Introduction The field treated in this study was discovered in 1981 and put on production in 1990. The field, with the area of 10 km in North-South and 6 km in East-West, is a saturated oil system with a large gas cap. Eleven wells have been drilled and seven wells are currently under operation. There are four horizontal wells and two multilateral wells. Each multilateral well has two legs. The four horizontal wells and two multilateral wells have nearly the same total completion length. According to the initial production rate as shown in Fig. 1, the reservoir quality may improve in the western part of the field. Because two vertical appraisal wells drilled in the central crest of the field in the southern portion showed relatively poor productivity, the southern part of the field has not been developed so far. Then the southwestern portion of the field draws our attention as a target for the next drilling campaign. There has been a great interest in the oil industry in the past decade to use multi-disciplinary geostatistical techniques for integrated reservoir characterization in various types of depositional environments. Research in industry and academia is making advances in better utilization of seismic attributes data for generating interwell data and information in reservoir areas where well data is non-existent. Although seismic data does not have the vertical resolution as much as that of well logs, its areal coverage provides details of reservoir unreachable by wells1. Therefore, we incorporate seismic information into a 3D geological model in order to evaluate the spatial distribution of petrophysical properties in the southwestern flank of the structure. Geological Setting The field is located in a post-Jurassic salt basin. Oil and gas have been trapped in a NNW-SSE trending, faulted anticlinal structure, where the crest is in the northwest. The salt movement in Albian to early Cenomanian was closely related with the development of the structure. The reservoir is Albian, post-salt shallow marine carbonate, covered by Cenomanian deep marine marl. It was cored on two wells in the central-south and central-north part of the field, and has been studied precisely. Reservoir Description The main rock-types of the reservoir are packstone, grainstone and subordinate wackestone, and fine- to silty- grained clastics are present especially in the basal interval. Pelecypods, gastropods, peloids, ooids and intraclasts are the dominant grain components. The overall depositional environment was inferred a shallow carbonate shelf to lagoon adjacent to a clastic-dominated shoreline during transgressive stage.",,

(A) ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: The Malmoe Citytunnel project embraces an 18 km long rail section divided into a 2-track, 12 km part-route, which provides a direct connection from Malmoe Main Station through a 6 km long tunnel passing beneath the downtown area to the new land link with Denmark, and a 6 km long single-track rail section, which connects the towns to the east of Malmoe with the regional passenger transport system of the province of Schonen. As a result of new, comprehensive ecological legislation in Sweden, approval can only be obtained from a special environment court which first has to assess the effects on the environment as well as the measures to be resorted to minimise the ecological effects resulting from the project. The City of Malmoe's subsurface is complex with glacial marls above fissured water permeable limestone containing flint layers up to 50 cm thick. The groundwater level is located close to the surface and it can be presumed that the environment court will at the most only approve minimum temporary lowering of the groundwater if at all. The bored tunnel is Sweden's first rail tunnel to be built with the aid of a tunnel driving machine. (A)",,

Methods: Fasting blood samples were obtained from 35 male volunteers aged 19-33 years, half an hour before sunset on the first day as a baseline and the last day of Ramadan. The lipids and lipoprotein contents of the samples were determined and the results obtained were compared using Student's paired t-test. Results: The results showed a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol level as well as total cholesterol/ high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol/high density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratios in the hyperlipidemic subjects together with a marl;ed increase-in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels (P<0.05).: However, in the normal subjects, only low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels and total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratios were found to decrease significantly during Ramadan fasting (P <0.05). In the group who had decreased their mean daily energy intake more than 500 kcal/day during Ramadan fasting, there was a significant decrease in the serum triglyceride and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels as well as total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein-cholesterol,and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol/high density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratios. Whereas in the other group, only low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels with low density lipoprotein-cholesterol/high density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio were decreased. Conclusion: The results obtained indicate positive effects of Ramadan fasting on blood lipid profiles, especially in hyperlipidemic subjects and in subjects in whom the reduction of mean daily energy intake was more than 500 kcal/day.",,

Kudrass'}]","Five potential ODP drill sites in the SE Sulu Basin were surveyed for morphology, heat flow, hydrocarbon content of surface sediments, and sedimentology of late Pleistocene to Holocene sediments. Five piston cores were recovered from water depths between 3634 and 4600 m. The pelagic sediments consist of nannofossil-foraminifer marl and are interbedded with carbonate-poor and carbonate-rich turbidites. Turbiditic intercalations are abundant in the deeper parts of the basin (below 4000 m), whereas they are rare in marginal settings (Core KL 67—Site 769). Core KL 78 (near Site 768) records fewer turbidites and a composition change since isotopic stage 5c. Pelagic sedimentation rates typically range between 52 and 66 mm/k.y., with a carbonate input of 11-21 g m~ yr ~ l . Indications of major carbonate dissolution are absent even at 4600 m water depth. Near Site 769 (Core KL 67), gravity sliding and slumping may have removed several portions of the late Pleistocene sediments. INTRODUCTION In the course of a pre-site survey of ODP drill sites during cruise SO 58, five sites in the SE Sulu Basin (Fig. 1) were investigated with respect to morphology (Figs. 2 and 3), heat flow, surface sediments, and hydrocarbon gases. Five piston cores with a total length of ca. 67 m were recovered at five sites (Table 1). In addition, Core KL 96 from Sonne cruise SO 49 is considered for comparison. HYDROGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS The Sulu Sea is a marginal oceanic basin with a maximum depth of more than 4900 m, which is completely enclosed by shallow sills except for two deeper channels. Marginal depths are less than 200 m, whereas the channels—one off Panay, the other one between Negros and Mindanao—have maximum sill depths of 420 and 250 m, respectively. Situated in the tropical monsoon region of the Indonesian Archipelago, the surface circulation of the Sulu Sea is largely driven by the seasonally reversing winds (Wyrtki, 1961). Surface waters exchange readily with those of the surrounding Celebes and South China seas, but the renewal of deep and intermediate waters only takes place through the deepest, northern channel that connects the Sulu Sea to the South China Sea (Frische and Quadfasel, this volume). Therefore, the hydrographic conditions of the deeper Sulu Sea differ remarkably from those of the western Pacific Ocean. Most prominent is absence of a typical decrease of temperature with increasing depth below the warm surface water; instead, the waters below 1000 m down to 4900 m uniformly show a temperature of about 10°C (Wyrtki, 1961; Frische and Quadfasel, this volume). Although the dissolved-oxygen content of the deep water below 2500 m is low (< 1.9-2.0 mL/L), oxygenated conditions are established in the whole basin. Salinity and SiO2 content likewise exhibit little variation below 2500-m depth and are low compared to the western Pacific deep water. 1 Rangin, C , Silver, E., von Breymann, M. T., et al., 1990.

MORPHOLOGY AND STRUCTURAL FRAME NW-SE seismic sections of the SE Sulu Basin (Hinz et al., 1987; Rangin, 1989) reveal several major structural and morphological elements. To the northwest, the Cagayan Ridge bounds the basin against the shallower NW Sulu Basin. At about 2200 fathoms (ca. 4000 m) depth, the steep eastern flank of the Cagayan Ridge abuts sharply against the turbidite plain of the Sulu Trench. Farther to the southeast, the Sulu Trench is paralleled on its eastern side by (1) the accretionary wedge associated with the northeastward subduction of the SE Sulu Basin, (2) the Sulu fore-arc basin, and (3) the Sulu fore-arc ridge. Core station KL 67 (Fig. 2) is situated between the Cagayan Ridge and Sulu Trench on a terrace high on the southeastern slope of a small, more or less isolated ridge. Station KL 69 lies on an even, gently eastward-sloping seafloor, much closer to the axis of the turbiditic Sulu Trench basin (Fig. 3). Cores KL 78 and KL 80 were taken on the basin plain further to the south. The latter two stations are separated by a shallow, east to westtrending sill. East of the Sulu Trench, core station KL 82 is located on the eastern flank of a NNE-trending ridge within the accretionary wedge which, as a whole, is forming a belt of roughly parallel, narrow basins and ridges. About 150-200 km farther to the southwest (Fig. 1), core station KL 96 (SO 49) is situated at the transition from the southeast slope of Cagayan Ridge to a minor basin plain above the floor of the Sulu Trench proper.",,

In this work these sequences are ordered according to Mediterranean glacio-eustatic oscillations. The Tortonian marine cycle end with a restricted lagoon record with grey sapropelic marls and an erosive surface (T/M episode). The marine Messinian transgression starts with a new marine-tidal cycle (entry of Globorotalia mediterranea. MI Synthem-Fm. Calizas de Santanyi) with four diverse records (infralittoral, mangrove-low coastal lagoon etc.) depending on the influence of the emerged relief. The last Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) is characterized with a new restricted record and a singular Lagomare fauna (MII-Fm. Calizas Pont d'Inca; MIII-Fm.

This work thus proposes the differentiation of a tidal marine messinian cycle for the last Miocene of Mallorca, between two restricted episodes. The Majorcan messinian record documents the distension experienced by the Balearic arc according to the influence of relief, which can provide new perspectives regarding the MSC-Lagomare and the settlement of the archipelago in the Messinian age.",,

Fellino Ridge (Campania Appennines), has led to the recognition of a km-scale overturned anticline characterized by tight geometry and associated with a NW-verging thrust which brought Jurassic over Cretaceous successions. The overturned fold is a N50-70 degrees-trending non-cylindrical structure, whereas the thrust is refolded by a N100-120 degrees-trending open anticline. Such a structure is recognizable also toward the south-east not far from the investigated area (i.e. Nola-Lauro Ridge). The angle between the two fold hinges is 40 degrees-60 degrees, as shown by geological mapping. The geometric reconstruction of the geological structures outcropping in the study area has been realized by means of two viable cross-sections (called AA' and BB' in fig. 6). The construction of the geological sections has been carried out considering the thickness obtained by the stratigraphic analysis of carbonate successions outcropping along the Mt. Fellino Ridge (fig. 2). Further, the stratigraphic analysis of several carbonate successions outcropping both along the Mt. Fellino Ridge and in the wider area of the Avella Mts-Nola-Lauro Ridge allowed five chronostratigraphic units to be characterized, showing different litho-sedimentological features and biostratigraphic content. In particular, the five chronostratigraphic Mesozic Units are, from bottom to top: - Lias: about 700 in of limestones and dolomite containing mainly Palaeodasycladus mediterraneus (PIA), Orbitopsella praecursor (GUEMBEL) and, in the upper part, large spathic shells of bivalves of the << Lithiotis facies >> Auct.; - Dogger: about 400 m of oolitic and pseudo-oolitic limestones and subordinate dolomite, containing mainly Valvulina lugeoni SEPTFONTAINE, Mesoendothyra croatica Gusic, the dasycladaceans Selliporella donzellii SARTONI & CRESCENTI, Pfenderina salernitaiia SARTONI & CRESCENTI, Pfenderella arabica REDMOND, Satorina apuliensis FOURCADE & CHOROWICS; - Malm: about 400-450 of limestones which consist of calcilutites and rarely of calcarenites, sometimes oolitic, containing Cladocoropsis mirabilis FELIX, Kumubia palastiniensis HENSON, Valvulina lugeoni SEPTFONTAINE, Parurgonina caelinensis CUVILLIER, FOURY & PIGNATTI-MORANO, Clypeina jurassica FAVRE, Salpingoporella annulata CAROZZI and Campbelliella striata (CAROZZI); - Lower Cretaceous (Neocomian-Albian): about 600 m of whitish limestones (from mudstones to grainstones) containing mainly Praechrysalidina intracretacea LUPERTO SINNI, Orbitolina (Mesorbitolina) texana (ROEMER), Orbitolina (Mesorbitolina) parva DOUGLAS, Cuneolia laurentii SARTONI & CRESCENTI, Cuneolina scarsellai DE CASTRO, Sabaudia minuta (HOFKER), Ovalveolina reicheli DE CASTRO, Paracoskinolina tunesiana PEYBFRNES, Neoiraqia insolita (DECROUEZ & MOULLADE), dasycladacean algae among which, in the lower part of the succession, Salpingoporella cemi RADOICIC, Salpingoporella annulata CAROZZI, Praturlonella danilovae (RADOICIC), and in the upper part Salpingoporella dinarica RADOICIC and Salpiagoporella turgida RADOICIC. - Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian-Senonian): about 650 in of limestones (mainly mudstones-wackestones), sometimes loferitic and stromatolitic, with rare intercalations of dolomites in the lower portion, and greenish marls. This interval contains Sellialveolhm viallii COLALONGO, Pseudorhapydionina dubia (DE CASTRO), Biplanata peneropliformis HAMAOUI & SAINT-MARC, Nezzazata simplex OMARA, Biconcava bentori HAMAOUI & SAINT-MARC, Cisalveolina fraasi (GUEMBEL), Pseudolituonella reicheli MARIE, Chiysalidina gradala D'ORBIGNY, Cuneolina pavonia parva HENSON, Nezzazatinella cf. aegyptiaca (SAID & KENAWY), Dicyclina schlumbergeri MUNIER-CHALMAS, Accordiella conica FARINACCI, Moncharmonti. a apenninica (DE CASTRO), Scandonea samnitica DE CASTRO. Among the macrofossils fragments and shells of Rudists are abundant. The trace of the cross-section AN is N120 degrees-trending (i.e. sub-orthogonal to the first phase fold axis), whereas the trace of the cross-section BB' is N20 degrees (i.e. perpendicular to the second phase fold axis). in the geological section AN, one can observe the N50-70 degrees-trending overturned fold with a tight geometry (FLEUTY, 1964), in the hangingwall of the thrust. Moreover, a splay thrust cuts the Malm deposits, causing the imbrication of two different slices. The tight geometry of the plicative structure could be linked to the evolution of a previous blind-thrust into a breakthrough thrust (SUPPE & MEDWEDEFF, 1990). In the geological section BB' is possible to detect the refolding of the first phase fold by a N100-120 degrees-trending open fold. Further, the hinge of the N50-70 degrees-trending fold has been displaced by a left-lateral strike-slip N110-120 degrees-trending fault, which juxtaposed the eastern Avella Mts monocline and the Mt. Fellino Ridge polyphase structure. The NW-verging N50-70 degrees-striking fold-and-thrust structure clearly appears to be anomalously oriented if compared to the regional orogenic transport directions of the NW-SE-trending structures originated by the Neogene contractional tectonics. The complex pattern observed in the investigated area is probably linked to the passive counter-clockwise rotation induced by the formation of a unique structural arc, about 60 km long, which extends from Cervialto Mt. to Caserta Mts. and is also responsible for the generation of the younger N 100-120 degrees-trending open folds. Late out-of-sequence structural arcs have already been recognized in the southern Apennines by several authors (PATACCA et alii, 1990; SCHIATTARELLA, 1996; PATACCA & SCANDONE, 2001), which linked them to Pliocene contractional events. The different geometry of two plicative phases (i.e. N50-70 degrees-trending tight fold and N100-120 degrees-trending open folds) suggests different conditions of deformation (i.e. different structural levels). In particular, the first phase folds suffered a greater load than the second phase ones, which are formed during Pliocene times, when widespread exhumation phenomena occurred (SCHiATTARELLA et alii, 2006).",,

Unit I consists of five lithofacies: (A) nodular carbonates and marls, (B) massive dolostones, (C) bioclastic limestones, (D) mudstones, and (E) chert, which are characteristic of sedimentation and early diagenesis in a shallow lacustrine environment. Two main stages of the same general lowstand situation are reflected in mineralogy and isotope geochemistry results. An initial stage is suggested by the presence of non-stoichiometric dolomite and trioctahedral smectites. High delta-O-18 and delta-C-13 values of the dolomites (+ 5.5 and + 2.9 delta-parts per thousand, respectively) indicate strongly evaporative conditions. A second stage is characterized by the presence of calcite, fibrous clay minerals and by generally lower delta-O-18 (from + 1.5 to - 6.5 delta-parts per thousand and delta-C-13 (from - 1 to - 9.8 delta-parts per thousand values for carbonates, which suggest more diluted waters during this lowstand phase of the lake. Unit II comprises seven lithofacies: (A) conglomerates, (B) intraclastic mudstones, (C) laminated marls, (D) massive mudstones, (E) diatomaceous marls, (F) laminated bioclastic limestones, and (G) root-bioturbated limestones. Both conglomerates and intraclast mudstones fill sharply eroded contacts in the underlying deposits of Unit I. We demonstrate how the arrangement of facies, supported by isotopic results from the carbonates delta-O-18 (from - 0.7 to - 7.2 delta-parts per thousand; delta-C-13 from - 4.2 to - 8.6 delta-part per thousand), is clearly indicative of deeper lake conditions. The basal reworked facies mark the initial phase of a lake transgression. In contrast with Unit I, the clay mineral assemblage from unit II is mainly detrital. Clay minerals thus also support the interpretation of a dilute water body, consistent with a highstand of the palaeolake.",,

Guerrero-Campo', 'org': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'orgs': ['Spanish National Research Council']}]","This article reviews the current knowledge about erosion processes in badlands and other strongly eroded areas in the northern half of Aragon (Spain), from the Middle Ebro Basin to the Pyrenees. The four most extensive lithologies with the strongest erosion processes were selected: pure gypsum from the Central Ebro Valley, Miocene clays from Hoya de Huesca and Somontano, Eocen marls from the Prepyrenees and Eocen flysch from the Pyrenees. The climate of each substratum was studied, as well as the most important edaphic and lithological characteristics in arder to explain the erosion processes. Sorne information about erosion rates and vegetation characteristics from each substratum were included. Also vegetation patterns in these areas and their interactions with erosion processes and other factors were interpretted.
Very strong differences between the lythologies were found. Pure gypsum has high infiltration and low erosion rates, but the ion exportation by dissolution is high. These characteristics and the low annual rainfall mean that the vegetation has to resist a high water stress. The vegetation pattern is very uniform and topography is the most important factor to explain this.
However, in the gullies of eocen marls, infiltration is very low anderosion rates are very high. These strong erosion processes cause formation of a mosaic with stable, depositional and eroded areas in close proximity to each other. This implies that the vegetation is very heterogeneous in small spatial scales, and typically there is a species mixture. Generally, Miocen clays are characteristic between eocen marls and pure gypsum, and the characteristics of eocen flysch are usually similar to eocen marls.",,

Three thrust-fault zones have been studied in order to investigate the role of deformation on mineral transformations. Two of the thrust faults contain a thin shear band comprised of intensely cleaved black marls with calcite veins which are distinct from the surrounding grey marls. The mineral assemblages in the grey marls are quartz, calcite, illite, chlorite with minor dolomite and feldspars, the clay fraction is composed of illite, chlorite and minor I/S mixed layers. No major mineralogical changes related to deformation are observed except in the most strained sediments in which kaolin has been detected. Kaolin is the major component of the black marls, with a minor amount of detrital quartz, illite and chlorite. The kaolin polytype is dickite according to powder XRD and IR spectroscopy. Texture analysis shows that the black marls are composed of millimetric lenses of undeformed silt embedded in strongly deformed illite-dickite-rich sediment. The low-magnification transmission electron microscope images reveal that clay minerals are oriented with their (001) plane parallel to the foliation and that dickite occurs as large (3 mu m) deformed crystals, or as small defect-free crystals generally embedded in illite. The 2M polytype nature of dickite has been characterised by HRTEM and selected-area electron diffraction. Long sequence polytypes and complex disordered structures are also locally observed in large crystals. Microtextural relationships suggest that dickite is a syn-kinematic mineral which precipitated after partial illite dissolution. The potassium released during the reaction may have left the system through fluid circulation in the shear zone. The occurrence of syn-kinematic dickite in highly strained shear zones of thrust faults suggests that deformation is an important factor promoting fluid-sediment interactions and clay mineral reactions.",,

 with calcite being considered the dominant mineral during the Ordovician, Devonian-mid Carboniferous, and Jurassic-Cretaceous
 to Early/Middle Cenozoic (e.g. Sandberg 1983; Wilkinson and Algeo 1989). Variation in carbonate mineralogy has been related
 to the position of global sea level (emergent or submergent modes, Wilkinson et al. 1985), change in rates of seafloor spreading
 (e.g. Mackenzie and Pigott 1981; Hardie 1996),PCO
 2 level (e.g. Sandberg 1985; Mackenzie and Morse 1992; Hallock 1997) and Mg/Ca ratios related to spreading rate (e.g. Stanley
 and Hardie 1998). However, other researchers suggest that the assumption of change of original carbonate mineralogy through
 time needs to be re-evaluated in the light of mineralogical change that is related to water temperature or latitudes (e.g.
 Nelson 1988). Evaluation of Ordovician (Arenig to Ashgill) Gordon Group carbonates of Tasmania (Australia), based on petrographic
 (e.g. abundantChlorozoan biota, and oomold texture) and geochemical criteria (such as high Sr/Na ratios) indicated that aragonite (not calcite) was the
 predominant mineral in these warm water, subtropical carbonates (Rao 1990). Petrographic (e.g. presence or absence of aragonite
 relicts, abundant acicular to fibrous isopachous marine cement, presence of diffuse laminae and a number of spalled ooids)
 and geochemical evidences (such as elevated Sr) in the Upper Jurassic Mozduran limestone, in Kopet-Dagh Basin in northeast
 Iran, showed variation in carbonate mineralogy, in spite of similar atmosphericPCO
 2 level, global sea-level and tectonic setting. This is evidenced by aragonite occurring in the shallowest part of the basin
 (Adabi and Rao 1991) and mainly calcite with some aragonite forming in the relatively deeper water (below wave base) (Adabi
 1997). Carbonate mineralogy in Recent shallow marine carbonates, and in experimental studies, varies with seawater temperature.
 In the Recent, aragonite is the predominant mineral in warm, shallow marine carbonates and calcite the dominant mineral in
 marine cool water carbonates (James and Clarke 1997). Therefore, variations in carbonate mineralogy in the Mozduran limestone
 are attributed to seawater temperature assuming invariant seawater chemistry prevailed in the Upper Jurassic. Several Jurassic
 examples show variations in ooid carbonate mineralogy, such as the Upper Jurassic Smackover oolite of the Gulf Coast region
 (southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana) and Upper Jurassic ooids in the Purbeck limestones of Swiss and French Jura. These
 results are not in agreement with the concept of a “calcite sea” during the Ordovician and the Upper Jurassic periods. Very
 recently, Westphal and Munnecke (2003) showed that in spite of the tendency of abiotic precipitates (Sandberg 1983) and skeletal
 mineralogy (Stanley and Hardie 1999) to follow the general trend of calcite seas and aragonite seas, organisms with calcite
 and aragonite mineralogy coexisted throughout the Phanerozoic. They have examined the temporal and spatial distribution of
 limestone-marl alternations in Ordovician, Jurassic and Cretaceous (times of calcite seas). Limestone-marl alternations are
 most abundant in settings that favored aragonite production and accumulation analogous to the modern environment (Westphal
 and Munnecke 2003). If the above observations confirmed, the proposed secular variation in Phanerozoic carbonate mineralogy
 needs to be re-evaluated.",,

Based on limited core samples available and on data gathered from an outcrop analogue north and south of the producing field, the sedimentary, early diagenetic and fracture-related characteristics of this dual porosity reservoir were studied and compared with the fold-and-thrust belt evolution context of the area. Additionally microthermometric analyses on aqueous and petroleum fluid inclusions have been integrated with kinematic and thermal 2D basin modelling to link the diagenetic history in the burial and thermal evolution of the reservoir and finally, to comment its implication on reservoir controlling parameters. The Eocene succession represents a shallowing upward sequence starting with open marine bioclastic medium-bedded limestones, which grades, into fabric destructive massive sucrosic and subsequently fine-crystalline dolomites. The presence of anhydrite nodules and chickenwire-shaped calcite pseudomorphs after anhydrite as well as the existence of dolomitised algal mats point towards restricted sedimentary conditions. The near surface sedimentation conditions are also reflected by the presence of flat channel conglomerate and breccia beds in the upper part of the dolomites. The breccia display features typical for early diagenetic evaporite collapse breccias. These dolomites, which are 15m thick, are overlain by a 32 m thick shale and marl succession in which few lacustrine limestone beds are intercalated. Subsequently a few meters of pedogenetically overprinted marine limestones develop below the regionally recognised Kulana sealing shales above which Fateh Jang conglomerates occurs. This is followed by shales and fine grained sandstones of the Murree Formation which unconformably overlies the Eocene strata. δOand δC-values of the dolomite host rock vary between -0.5 to -6.3‰ and +1.2 and -4.5‰ respectively. These values are interpreted in terms of marine dolomites which were recrystallised by meteoric water infiltration. The marine limestones were also affected by this recrystallisation and possibly by additional interaction with hot fluids as testified by intensive neomorphism and their δOand δCvalues varying between –7.3 to –9.4‰ and –7.02 to –12.41‰, respectively. Especially the negative carbon isotope values point towards recrystallisation by soil-derived meteoric fluids. The late diagenesis is mainly characterised by (hydro)fracturation whereby at least seven distinct fracturation episodes were recognized. They are well-developed in the limestones just below the Kuldana shales. Noteworthy is that the carbonate reservoirs in the Potwar Basin are considered to produce mainly from fractures and from the Fateh Jang conglomerates and that the best reservoir producing level occurs just below the seal. The microtectonic analysis of the different fracture generations reflect the complex deformation history typical of “fold-and-thrust belts” (FFTB). The stable isotope signature and coeval fluid inclusions testify of an evolution from mixed marine and meteoric fluida, to burial rock buffered and overpressured fluids (90-170°C), which were episodically expelled below the Kuldana shales from deeper parts of the basin.

This is the first otolith-based neritic fish fauna known from the Mediterranean Early Oligocene. Additional data for Early Oligocene otolith-based fish faunas of the paleo-Mediterranean Basin are available only from the Liguro-Piemontese Basin, northern Italy, where the associations are dominated by deepwater fishes. Combining the data from both Mediterranean paleoenvironments, one obtains a list of 88 taxa of which 48 could be identified to species level. This is the only available overview on the composition of the otolith-based fish fauna in the Mediterranean realm during the Early Oligocene. It is shown that already in the Oligocene, the neritic fauna shows good affinities with the present-day Mediterranean one, while the deepwater fauna was a circumglobal oceanic one, strongly different from the Recent Mediterranean deepwater fauna. The Early Oligocene and Late Eocene Mediterranean otolith-based teleost faunas are compared to each other and to contemporaneous faunas from the Aquitaine Basin. This provides evidence for a very strong faunal break in both basins, both in the neritic and the mesopelagic fauna, and this faunal turnover is interpreted as a response to the paleoceanographic and climatic changes (cooling) that took place at the Late Eocene-Early Oligocene at global scale. Finally, the results indicate the great homogeneity of the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean faunas during the late Eocene. Notwithstanding the strong faunal turnover at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, the new Oligocene fauna also exhibits a similar homogeneity over a large geographic area which, for this time unit, can be extended to the Paratethys.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/D1/82/4F/D1824FAE7F2E9042E47D9AA683F946DB.pdf

CUSICK'}, {'name': 'BARBARA  ANDREAS'}, {'name': 'DENNIS  ANDERSON'}]","Twenty native Ohio vascular plant taxa, previously considered for review by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as possibly federally endangered or threatened, were studied over a two-year period to assess their rarity and threat of extirpation, nationally and in Ohio. Current information indicates that Aconitum noveboracense should be maintained as federally threatened, and that Calamagrostis insperata, Plantago cordata, and Platanthera leucophaea should be considered for listing as federally threatened. Current data on the status of Poa paludigena, Potamogeton hillii, Synandra hispidula, and Trollius laxus are too limited to make an adequate recommendation as to possible federal status. Although rare in Ohio, Cypripedium candidum and Veratrum woodii are apparently more frequent elsewhere and presently do not warrant listing. Unresolved taxonomic problems prevent specific recommendations for Polygonum pensylvanicum var. eglandulosum, and Rhus trilobata var. arenaria. Taxa frequent throughou~ much of their ranges, including Ohio, that do not appear to warrant listing are Panax quinquefolius, Platanthera {lava, Platanthera peramoena, Polemonium reptans var. villosum, and Sullivantia sullivantii. Hybrids that do not meet the definition of ""species"" under the Endangered Species Act are Asplenium X ebenoides, Asplenium X kentuckiense, and Muhlenbergia X curtisetosa. Several taxa of native Ohio vascular plants were placed under review by the U.SFish and Wildlife Service (Schreiner 1975) as a result of the Smithsonian Institution's report on endangered and threatened plant species in the United States (Ripley 1975). This notice was revised by Lamberton (1980). The Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Natural Areas and Preserves conducted a two-year (1979-1980) study of 20 taxa of federal concern under a contract with USFWS. During this period field and herbarium searches were made for the 20 taxa. Many new populations were located and the status of previously-known populations revised. The summary of the Division's recommendations to the USFWS reflects our present knowledge of these taxa both nationally and within Ohio. The 20 taxa surveyed are listed alphabetically. Each paragraph contains a summary of our present knowledge of a taxon organized as follows: taxonomic or nomenclatural information, if applicable; county and habitat of Ohio populations; and national range and frequency, if applicable. The term ""historical"" is used here to indicate specimens collected in Ohio prior to 1950. Aconitum noveboracense A. Gray (Ranunculaceae) The Ohio plants have been treated as Aconitum uncinatum L. subsp. noveboracense (A. Gray) Hardin (Hardin 1964) or subsumed without rank into 250 CASTANEA VOLUME 48 A. uncinatum (Keener 1976). Brink (1982) suggests that Ohio populations may be related to the western A. columbianum Nutt. in T.&G., an hypothesis as yet untested. Aconitum noveboracense is extant in two populations in Ohio, one each in Portage and Summit counties. The plants grow on moist, shaded talus in wooded gorges, near seeps formed by a disconformity between permeable Pennsylvanian sandstones and impermeable Mississippian shales. The Summit County population has suffered a notable decline in recent years, apparently due to browsing by deer (Andreas 1980). Asplenium X ebenoides R. R. Scott (Aspleniaceae) The hybrid nature of this fern is well established (Wagner 1954) and as such it does not fit guidelines for federal listing. This taxon also may be treated as X Asplenosorus ebenoides (R. R. Scott) Wherry (Walter et al1982). It presently is known from six sites in Greene, Highland, Morgan, and Washington counties, growing either on dolomite or sandstone. Each population consists of only one or two individuals. Asplenium X kentuckiense T. N. McCoy (Aspleniaceae) This hybrid taxon likewise is not federally listable. The first Ohio collection was from a sandstone cliff in Pike County in 1946. This site has been destroyed by quarrying. In 1979 this fern was collected on a sandstone exposure in Jackson County, but it has not been seen since at that location. Calamagrostis insperata Swallen (Poaceae) In Ohio, this grass is extant in two populations, one each in Jackson and Vinton counties. It grows in acidic soils of sunny openings in upland woods. One population occurs in an area that is logged periodically, but the plants seem vigorous and in little danger of extirpation. Outside Ohio, C. insperata is known only from a single county in Arkansas (Smith 1978) and two counties in Missouri (Steyermark 1963). Cypripedium candidum Muhl. (Orchidaceae) This orchid occurs in two populations in northwest Ohio, one in Henry County and one on the Erie-Sandusky counties border. This latter population is quite vigorous with thousands of individuals. Most of this population occurs in open moist fields which formerly had been strip mined for marl. The fields periodically are disced and burned to control woody vegetation, practices which seem to stimulate anthesis. As of 1979, C. candidum was observed in Portage County in northeast Ohio, but it may have disappeared from this site due to natural succession. Formerly this species was more widespread in the state. There are historical records from Lucas, Montgomery, Trumbull, and Wyandot counties. We were unable to locate a voucher for a report from Champaign County (Braun 1967). Muhlenbergia X curtisetosa (Scribn.) Bush (Poaceae) This grass has been described as a species (Bush 1919), a subspecies of M. schreberi Gmel. (Lamson-Scribner 1907), and a variety of M. schreberi (Steyermark & Kucera 1961). Pohl (1969) demonstrates that it is a hybrid derived from M. schreberi and some other rhizomatous species of the genus. Therefore it is not eligible for federal listing. No extant populations of this grass are known in Ohio. There are historical records from Belmont, Holmes, and Pickaway counties.",,

Scott'}, {'id': '53f46fa7dabfaee2a1dd3556', 'name': 'R.C. Finch'}]","A carbonate platform developed on the Chortís block beginning in the Berriasian-Aptian and ending in the Albian. This platform is represented in Honduras by carbonate strata of the Yojoa Group, mainly the Atima Formation. We report new stratigraphic and paleontological data from exposures of this carbonate package and superjacent Upper Cretaceous strata in easternmost Honduras. In addition, new paleontological data from west-central Honduras are presented confirming previous interpretations there. In west-central Honduras, carbonate deposition of the Atima Formation was interrupted in the Aptian by an influx of non-marine, terrigenous sediments of the ‘Mochito shale’, and terminated at the beginning of the Cenomanian by coarse redbed strata of the lower Valle de Angeles Group. The exact nature of the Atima/Valle de Angeles contact in west-central Honduras is not known, but may be gradational. In the Montanas de Colon area in eastern Honduras, no equivalent of the 'Mochito shale' has yet been identified, and late Albian deposition of the Atima was ended by an influx of fine-grained, shallow marine, terrigenous sediments of the Cenomanian ‘Krausirpi beds’. Although the Krausirpi beds are only known locally, we include them in the Yojoa Group as an informal member. After deposition of the Krausirpi beds, local subaerial exposure and erosion occurred prior to deposition of the redbeds of the lower Valle de Angeles Group. In west-central Honduras, carbonate platform deposition was resumed during the Cenomanian represented by the Jaitique Formation and by the slightly younger and lithologically distinct Esquías Formation just east of the outcrop area of the Jaitique. These limestone units conveniently divide the Valle de Angeles Group into lower and upper redbed sections. No equivalent limestone unit has been found in the Montañas de Colon area. Instead, deposition of continental redbeds began here in the Cenomanian and continued into latest Cretaceous, as indicated by radiometrically dated volcanic flow units within the redbeds. The Jaitique Formation consists of a lower thick-bedded limestone member overlain by a thin shaly limestone member in the area south and west of Lake Yojoa. In central Honduras the Esquias Formation consists of interbedded limestone, marl and shale. The remainder of Cretaceous deposition was fluvial clastic sediments and volcanic rocks which belong to the upper Valle de Angeles Group. New paleontologic data from limestone of the Atima Formation, shale of the Krausirpi beds, limestone conglomerate in the Valle de Angeles Group, and from the Jaitique Formation confirm the ages and depositional environments. The Atima ranges from Barremian-Aptian to late Albian based on ten foraminiferal taxa, one caprinid rudist and three calcareous algae. The Krausirpi beds are Albian-Cenomanian based on nine palynomorph taxa and two planktic foraminifers. The Jaitique is middle to late Cenomanian with the benthic foraminifer Biconcava, which is reported for the first time in the Caribbean Province. A Cenomanian dasyclad, Dissocladella undulata, was recovered in a limestone clast in the Valle de Angles Group suggesting the possibility that Cenomanian as well as older limestone units were eroded during the Late Cretaceous. The Atima records at least two shoaling upward depositional cycles, and the Jaitique was deposited in an open shelf environment that became restricted near the end of deposition.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/36/A4/9D/36A49DC63A66C8B4ECD40FEC6946757C.pdf

Detailed, geological survey (1:10.000 scale) allows us to lay out an updated structural map. Thrust tectonics prevails as it is showed by macro-folds around the main thrust front and by meso-scale folds, cleavage; reverse faults, S-C tectonites. WNW-ESE and N-S normal and transtensive faults, cutting the compressive features, complete the tectonic pattern. Fault-propagation folding model has been successfully applied in the reconstruction of geometric relationships between northern Matese and Montagnola. The small amount of displacement suggests the absence of a major thrust-zone and a general structural continuity among those two regions.

Their sonic complexity creates major difficulties for hydrocarbon exploration. Carbonate facies are divisible into three subgroups based on seismic character, sonic logs, velocity profiles, carbonate content, petrologic character and age. The oldest unit is the Angler Subgroup that consists of carbonate pelagic marls (CaC03 70%) with interbedded clastic-rich units.Zones of high velocity (>3,000m/s) are restricted to the deeply buried parts of the Albacore Subgroup, at TWT's greater than 0.8 seconds. The characteristics of this high velocity facies are: a composition of fine grained bioclast-rich packstones and wackestones with less than 10% silt sized quartz; the carbonate content exceeds 60%; the intervals are prone to cementation and are stylolitised; they are diachronous (i.e. cut across seismic boundaries); velocities progressively increase with depth; highest velocities occur where the unit is thickest towards the centre of the basin; velocity increases laterally with steepness of angle on downlap surfaces due to coarser grain sizes and inferred greater initial porosity; and velocities increase with stratigraphic age in the Albacore Subgroup. Regardless of burial depth the Angler and Hapuku Subgroups contain no significantly high velocity zones.An empirical relationship derived from this data set provides a basis for re-interpreting average velocity to the top of the Latrobe Group in areas underlying high velocity canyon-fill sediments.",,

At the downstream part, the chaotic morphology is affected by active mudflows with different dynamics and modalities of extension. The basal scarp (defined as a coastline) is beaten by swells. The latter alternates between marine erosion phases (during heavy agitations), followed by accumulation through the input of materials from the upstream coastal slope. The non-linear functioning in time and space of these cliffs is the result of relays and combinations of processes that we are researching to define and quantify.

The aim of this paper is to identify and evaluate possible interactions between global signals (orbital fluctuations, climate and eustasy) and local–regional tectonics forcing deposition and ecospace on an epicontinental shelf. High-resolution ammonite biostratigraphy, together with sedimentological, stratigraphical, mineralogical data, and ecostratigraphic interpretations, were re-examined to provide evidence for the combined action of tectonics, eustasy and insolation fluctuations on sedimentation in two sections which clearly differ in stratal pattern, both in the average thickness of limestone beds and in the frequency and character of marl intercalations. The detailed analysis of stratal patterns was used to identify and calibrate the influence of the different factors investigated. The identification of significant bedding planes in the sections studied enabled the recognition of eight bundles of beds (major cycles). The analysis and comparison of their internal structure, together with the information about tectonic and eustatic influences, enabled us to interpret the lower part of the sections (bundles 1 and 2) as being forced by interactions between orbital signals and tectonics, the upper part (bundles 6, 7 and 8) as being caused by interactions between orbital signals and eustasy, and the middle part (bundles 3, 4 and 5) as being related mainly to orbital forcing.",,

 The exposed sequence is mainly composed of monotonous marls and sandy marls. A rich fossil content, e.g. calcareous nannoplankton,
 is recorded. Some sandstone beds and two graded limestone beds with abundant lepidocyclinids and globigerinids are intercalated.
 The nannofossil assemblages from the measured profile of the Ayii Pantes Formation are attributed to theSphenolithus distentus Zone (NP 24) which is equivalent to theCyclicargolithus floridanus Subzone (CP 19a) of the Chattian, Upper Oligocene. The deposition took place in an euphotic subtidal environment situated
 on the eastern margin of the Apulian Platform. The lepidocyclinids were derived from this platform and were transported basinwards.
 The formation of the marls is influenced by sediment flux from the west.

In the southern and central parts of the Alai Range, towards the Alai Valley, mainly post-collisional granitoids were targeted for zircon U/Pb dating by Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), apatite fission-track (AFT) and apatite (U–Th–Sm)/He (AHe) thermochronology. These granitoids, and their thermally metamorphosed contact aureole, yielded Middle Permian zircon crystallization ages of 284 ± 4 to 264 ± 5 Ma. AFT ages (both using the traditional external detector approach as well as using LA-ICP-MS) for these samples are constrained to the Miocene and range between 22.3 ± 1.1 and 8.4 ± 0.3 Ma, while the AHe ages are somewhat younger, between 12.5 ± 0.8 and 5.0 ± 0.3 Ma. This low-temperature thermochronological data suggests an Early Miocene onset of denudation in this area in the Tien Shan orogen, continuing through the Miocene and Pliocene. This denudation is interpreted as a response to reactivation of the mountain belt in the framework of India–Eurasia convergence, and specific to this region, of the Pamir–Tien Shan interaction. On the northern slopes of the Alai Range, at the edge of the Ferghana Basin, a Late Palaeozoic conglomerate yielded a reset Early Cretaceous AFT age of 118 ± 7 Ma, pointing to an older denudation event with respect to those identified in the southern and central parts of the Alai Range. A Mesozoic sediment sample from the same region only contains a Late Triassic age component of ∼223 Ma. Mesozoic and Cenozoic age components on the other hand are all detected in the Cenozoic sediments of the Trans-Alai Range, at the transition between the southern Alai Valley and the Pamirs, revealing several Meso-Cenozoic denudation events in the adjoining basement source rocks. The age components in these detrital apatites are ∼207 Ma, ∼75 Ma, ∼18 Ma and ∼3 Ma. Keywords Zircon U/Pb dating LA-ICP-MS Apatite Thermochronology Alai Tien Shan Pamir 1 Introduction and Geological Setting The Tien Shan are the southernmost unit of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). The eastern segment of the Tien Shan is located in China, and the western segment for the most part in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan ( Fig. 1 ). Other parts still are in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan. The CAOB is a Palaeozoic accretionary orogen, composed of a multitude of different Precambrian and Palaeozoic units. These amalgamated between Siberia, Baltica and Tarim due to progressive closure of several oceanic basins, in the same fashion as its modern analogue of the circum-Pacific ( Windley et al., 2007 ). By the Permian, the accretionary tectonics in the CAOB culminated as all major composing units were joined. Late- and post-orogenic deformation and magmatism further shaped the CAOB basement architecture and the ancestral Tien Shan in particular (e.g. Allen et al., 1992; Carroll et al., 1995; Gao et al., 1998; Heubeck, 2001; Windley et al., 2007; Xiao et al., 2010 ). Evidence for widespread Late Carboniferous to Permian strike-slip deformation and shearing and rotation ( Allen et al., 1995; Laurent-Charvet et al., 2002; Buslov et al., 2003b ), and thus oroclinical bending ( Van der Voo et al., 2006 ) are prevalent throughout the region, as is the presence of contemporaneous post-collisional granitoids (e.g. Konopelko et al., 2007, 2008; Solomovich, 2007 ). After final construction, the CAOB was subjected to several phases of Mesozoic deformation and was again reactivated in the Late Cenozoic as a distant effect of the India–Eurasia collision (e.g. Molnar and Tapponnier, 1975; Otto, 1997; De Grave et al., 2007 ). Both the Mesozoic and Cenozoic reactivation episodes occurred in an intracontinental setting, as far-field effects of deformation at the (Eur)Asian margins. Tectonic inheritance and basement structure play a prominent role in the partitioning of strain to the interior parts of the CAOB and the Tien Shan in particular ( Allen and Vincent, 1997 ). In this way the CAOB represents the world’s largest and most active intracontinental orogenic system with the Tien Shan as an active mountain belt within that context. The current topography and active structures and mountain ranges of the Kyrgyz Tien Shan mimic its basement architecture. Both the mountain ranges and basement units mostly trend in east–west direction. Based on this structure, the Kyrgyz Tien Shan can be divided in three sections: the Northern (NTS), Central or Middle (MTS) and Southern Tien Shan (STS) ( Fig. 2 ). In literature these sections often carry several different names. Especially when correlating Kyrgyz Tien Shan with Chinese Tien Shan units this can become confusing. We try to follow the terminology used by Windley et al. (2007) and Biske and Seltmann (2010) as much as possible. The NTS in Kyrgyzstan is characterized by the presence of a presumed Precambrian micro-continental basement on which Palaeozoic continental magmatic arcs and Meso-Cenozoic basins developed. The NTS is vastly intruded by Early Palaeozoic (“Caledonian”) granitoids as well as by smaller, more isolated Late Palaeozoic (“Hercynian” or “Variscan”) post-collisional plutons ( Konopelko et al., 2008; Glorie et al., 2010a ). The NTS is separated from the MTS by the Nikolaev Line ( Fig. 2 ), which is sometimes considered to be an Early to Middle Palaeozoic suture, as small ophiolite remnants seem to be associated with it (e.g. Simonov et al., 2008 ). South of the Nikolaev Line the basement of the MTS is composed of Precambrian crust as well, often linked to peri-Gondwanan micro-continents ( Biske and Seltmann, 2010 ). This basement is covered by Middle-Palaeozoic passive margin sequences. While the characteristic large-scale Early Palaeozoic granitoids of the NTS are far less frequent, Late Palaeozoic post-collisional plutons occur within the MTS ( Mao et al., 2004; Chiaradia et al., 2006; Morelli et al., 2007 ). A second Palaeozoic suture, the ophiolite-bearing Atbashi-Inylchek or South Tien Shan suture separates the MTS from the STS ( Fig. 2 ). The STS represents a Late Palaeozoic collision–accretion system characterized by a complex fold-and-thrust structure ( Alekseev et al., 2007; Windley et al., 2007; Biske and Seltmann, 2010 ). Late Palaeozoic post-collisional plutons occur in this section as well ( Solomovich and Trifonov, 2002; Chiaradia et al., 2006; Konopelko et al., 2007, 2009; Solomovich, 2007; Seltmann et al., in press ). The NTS and MTS were added to the palaeo-Kazakhstan microplate during Early and Middle Palaeozoic accretion, while the STS developed in the Late Palaeozoic, as an accretionary belt between palaeo-Kazakhstan and Tarim. This latter, larger accretion event generated the post-collisional, mainly Permian intrusions as outlined above. These main composing sections of the Tien Shan are cut by the northwest-southeast striking Talas-Ferghana fault zone (TFF), effectively creating an eastern and western zone ( Fig. 2 ). The TFF is a Late Palaeozoic structure that played an important role in the post-orogenic deformation of the ancestral Tien Shan. It was clearly reactivated in the Meso-Cenozoic as demonstrated by the right-lateral offset of about 200 km of the Palaeozoic units. Current GPS observations confirm that the fault is still active with dextral slip-rates of about 10–20 mm/a ( Burtman et al., 1996 ). The Palaeozoic units west of the TFF are hence displaced relative to the north with respect to their counterparts east of the fault. In this paper we present new geochronologic and thermochronologic data that constrains the Late Palaeozoic to Recent evolution of the STS block, west of TFF. This part of the Kyrgyz Tien Shan is also known as the Turkestan-Alai section or Alai segment and supports the present-day Turkestan, Alai, and Kichi-Alai mountain ranges with peaks up to 5500 m a.s.l ( Fig. 3 ). To the south of these ranges the Alai Valley or Alai Basin is situated. This is an intramontane sedimentary basin of an average elevation of 2700 m (3200–3500 m from north to south in our study area, Fig. 3 ), capturing the Meso-Cenozoic sediments shed from the STS (to the north) and the advancing Pamir thrust nappes (to the south). The now intramontane Alai Basin once formed a corridor linking the Tarim Basin (east) with the Tajik Basin (west) in the pre-Late Cenozoic ( Strecker et al., 2003 ). The STS and Alai Basin are separated from the leading edge of the Pamirs, the Trans-Alai Range, by the Vakhsh fault zone ( Fig. 2 ), presently a reactivated thrust fault system (Main Pamir Thrust, MPT). The Trans-Alai Range hosts some of the major Pamir peaks such as Ibn Sina peak (peak Lenin, 7134 m) and Ismoil Somoni peak (peak Stalin or Communism peak, 7495 m) for example. The (Turkestan)-Alai section from which our samples originate, is one of three subdivisions of the STS. Indeed, the STS can be further divided in three segments, an eastern section, the Kokshaal section, is the STS unit in southern Kyrgyzstan, east of the TFF. The western section is the Kyzylkum section and is a part of the STS, located in Uzbekstan. The (Turkestan)-Alai section is the central section in between Kokshaal and Kyzylkum ( Biske and Seltmann, 2010; Seltmann et al., in press ; Fig. 2 ). During the Mesozoic, the entire orogen of the ancestral Tien Shan was subjected to protracted reactivation, building an effective physiographic barrier between the Junggar and Kazakhstan Basins to the north and the Tarim Basin to the south ( Graham et al., 1993; Hendrix, 2000 ). The Junggar and Tarim Basins acted as foreland basins to the evolving orogen. These foreland basins as well as Mesozoic intramontane Tien Shan basins record several coarse, clastic sediment pulses with angular unconformaties at their base. These sediment records point toward successive distinct orogenic phases in the Late Triassic (–Early Jurassic), Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous, and the Late Cretaceous ( Hendrix et al., 1992; Allen et al., 1993; Vincent and Allen, 2001 ). The driving forces for these successive reactivation events are thought to be contemporaneous with collision–accretion events transpiring at the margins of the growing (Eur)Asian continent. During the Mesozoic several so-called Cimmerian blocks (peri-Gondwanan fragments) docked with (Eur)Asia as several tracts of the (Palaeo-)Tethys Ocean lithosphere were consumed by progressing subduction. Several of these blocks (such as the Tibetan blocks Qiangtang, Lhasa and others) were ultimately pulled in the subduction zone and collided with the southern Eurasian active margin in a punctuated fashion throughout the Mesozoic era (e.g. Otto, 1997; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Schwab et al., 2004; Kapp et al., 2007 , and references therein). It is thought that these collisions, which together comprise the Cimmerian orogeny, propagated deformation to the north, and in this way reactivated structures in the Tien Shan belt (e.g. Graham et al., 1993; Allen and Vincent, 1997; Vincent and Allen, 2001; De Grave et al., 2007 ). In this context, the Pamir indenter played a pivotal role as conduit for deformation directly to the Kyrgyz STS terrane. As mentioned, the Late Cenozoic in the Tien Shan is characterized by a renewed and intense episode of tectonic reactivation due to ongoing India–Eurasia convergence. This reactivation is responsible for the formation of the modern Tien Shan orogen and its topography as it appears today. Evidence for initial growth of the modern Tien Shan is found in foreland and intramontane basins in the form of increased (coarse clastic) sediment rates, and unconformities. These sediments eroded from the growing mountain ranges and advancing thrust nappes and are deposited in these basins from the Late Oligocene onwards, with thick sequences in the Miocene, Pliocene to Recent (e.g. Allen et al., 1993; Cobbold et al., 1994; Yin et al., 1998 ). From seismological, geophysical and geodetic investigations it is clear the Tien Shan are a recent and active intracontinental mountain belt (e.g. Abdrakhmatov et al., 1996; Omuralieva et al., 2009 ). The Late Cenozoic reactivation is translated in fold-and-thrust tectonics ( Yin et al., 1998; Hubert-Ferrari et al., 2007; Oskin and Burbank, 2007 ) in the Tien Shan ranges, as well as in strike-slip deformation ( Burtman et al., 1996; Allen et al., 2001; Buslov et al., 2003a ). The continued crustal shortening induced by the indentation of the Indian plate invokes the convergence of the STS with the Tarim microplate (east of TFF) and the Pamirs (west of TFF) ( Fig. 2 .). The STS are thrust on top of Tarim ( Allen et al., 1999; Yang and Liu, 2002 ), while in our study area, it is the Pamir terrane which is thrust atop the Alai Valley and the STS ( Coutand et al., 2002 ) along the Main Pamir Thrust (MPT) ( Fig. 3 ). In this area, from terrain and geophysical observations, Coutand et al. (2002) identify two stages of Late Cenozoic deformation, a first in the Late Oligocene–Early Miocene, and a second contraction from the Middle Miocene until the present. This is corroborated by findings in the Eastern Pamir ( Robinson et al., 2007 ) and confirms earlier data by e.g. Pavlis et al. (1997) in the Pamir–Tien Shan convergence zone west of the Alai Valley, towards the Gissar area and the Tajik Basin. 2 Samples and methodology Sample details including locations and lithology are listed in Table 1 . Their positions are plotted on a simplified geological map and digital terrain model ( Fig. 3 ). The samples compose a more or less north–south profile across the central Alai Range from the Trans-Alai/Alai Basin (south) to the southern edges of the Ferghana Basin (north). The samples from the Alai Range mainly consist of Late Palaeozoic post-collisional granites and diorites. This type of intrusions are found throughout the Kyrgyz Tien Shan, in all composing terranes (NTS, MTS, and STS), as outlined in the previous section. In the Alai (and Kichi-Alai) Range, they are intruded in a basement of mainly Middle to Late Palaeozoic marine deposits ( Pickering et al., 2008 . Biske and Seltmann, 2010 ). Two intrusions of this type were sampled ( Table 1 , Fig. 3 ). In the Kokbulak Mountains of the northern-central part of the Alai Range, an intrusive stock close to Murdash was sampled. In fact this intrusion seems to consist of a main northern body and a smaller cupola just south of the main body. Tursungaziev and Petrov (2008) named these intrusions according to local place names as Belauli (Belaulinski) and Askaly (Askalinski) respectively. Samples AI-37 and AI-38 represent a vertical section in the northern part of this pluton, sample KYR-10 is a sample from the southern part. Sample KYR-11 is a quartz-biotite schist from the amphibolite contact aureole of the Belauli and Askaly plutons. It is located in between the KYR-10 and AI-37/AI-38 sample sites. The Middle–Late Palaeozoic sedimentary protolith was subjected to thermal metamorphism during intrusion and post-magmatic cooling of the granitoids. The second intrusion that was sampled for this study, is located in the southern part of the Alai Range, close to the Alai Valley transition. Sample AI-40 comes from this body in the Kashka-Suu valley towards Kindyk Pass and Skobieleva peak. Tursungaziev and Petrov (2008) named the main intrusion here as Dzhaman-Dzhailiuski. Samples AI-41 and AI-42 are from smaller granitic outcrops up the Kashka-Suu valley in between the main Dzhaman-Dzhailiuski and the Sary-Mogol intrusion (somewhat more westwards, Fig. 3 ). These outcrops probably correspond to a small intrusion labelled by Tursungaziev and Petrov (2008) as the Balyktinski body. AI-42 in fact comes from a felsic dyke associated with this body. Solomovich (2007) calls this larger area of igneous intrusions in this part of the Alai Range as the Karakazyk pluton. Two other, non-granitic samples from the Alai Range were collected near its northern boundary at the South Ferghana Thrust (SFT). KYR-13 is a conglomerate sample containing granitic and other crystalline clasts. It was taken close to Gulcha Village, near Chigirchik pass towards the Ferghana Basin. According to several consulted maps, the conglomerate is from a unit of Late Carboniferous–Permian molasse ( Fig. 3 ), associated with the Late Palaeozoic Tien Shan orogeny. KYR-12, a sandstone sample, was collected closeby, just southwest of Gulcha village, in a unit of Mesozoic sediments of the Ferghana Basin. These sediments are listed from Triassic to Palaeocene depending on the maps consulted. The most detailed description comes from Tursungaziev and Petrov (2008) who base their findings on older 1: 200,000 scale Soviet maps and assign the sediments to the Early to Late Cretaceous transition. They are capped by Late Cretaceous, Cenomanian–Turonian clays and marls that contrary to the older sediments are at least partly considered to be of marine nature. Burtman et al. (1996) for example describe this area, including the Ferghana Basin, to evolve from continental settings to shallow, epicontinental marine environments at that time. Finally, two Neogene sandstones (KYR-06 and 07) from the Alai Basin and Trans Alai Range were sampled near the Tajik border. The samples were separated using conventional magnetic and heavy liquid techniques. Apatites and zircons were handpicked under a high-resolution zoom-stereomicroscope, avoiding inclusions and impurities as much as possible. They were analyzed using several geochronological and thermochronological techniques in a multi-method approach in order to elucidate the post-amalgamation history of the Tien Shan and of the Alai region of the Kyrgyz Southern Tien Shan in particular. Zircon U/Pb dating (ZUPb) using LA-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry) was performed on zircons from the granitic plutons to constrain their crystallization ages and to obtain a high-temperature benchmark for thermochronology analysis of the basement. These “Hercynian” granitoids also have a significance from the viewpoint of ore geology (e.g. Mao et al., 2004; Morelli et al., 2007 ) and knowledge of their emplacement ages is important in that context as well. Absolute radiometric age information from this region is still scarce. This study presents new ZUPb ages for the granitic bodies described above. Low-temperature thermochronology was applied on apatites from both the basement and the basin samples. The basement samples on one hand include the same granitoids as dated with ZUPb. Both the apatite fission-track (AFT) and Apatite (U–Th–Sm)/He (AHe) thermochronometers were used to constrain the cooling and hence denudation of the basement during the Meso-Cenozoic reactivation events in an absolute time frame. In tandem, detrital apatites from the Meso-Cenozoic sandstone samples from the southeastern Ferghana Basin and the eastern Alai Basin and Trans-Alai Range were analyzed with the AFT method in order to identify the individual cooling age components from the exhumed basement. Both the traditional external detector as well as the LA-ICP-MS approach to AFT dating were employed in this work. A brief account of analytical procedures is given below. 2.1 Zircon U/Pb dating by LA-ICP-MS Zircons were carefully handpicked, mounted in epoxy and polished. Direct analysis of the zircon grains was accomplished by using laser ablation (LA) for sample introduction. A New Wave UP193HE excimer-based laser ablation system (Fremont, CA, USA) was equipped with a teardrop-shaped low-volume (<2.5 cm 3 ) ablation cell ( Horstwood et al., 2003; Frei and Gerdes, 2009 ) and coupled to the mass spectrometer. A helium–argon mixture was used as carrier gas, whereby argon was introduced and mixed with the helium after the ablation cell position. Determination of U, Th, and Pb isotope concentrations was carried out using a Thermo Scientific Element XR Sector Field ICP-MS (Bremen, Germany) and isotope ratios were determined. Measurements were performed at the ICP-MS facilities of the Department of Analytical Chemistry, Ghent University and procedures are nearly identical to those described by Glorie et al. (in press) . Instrumental details are listed in Table 2 . Data reduction was performed using the PepiAGE-software ( Dunkl et al., 2009 ). Laser-induced elemental fractionation was corrected for by using the arithmetic mean isotopic ratios for each run. Instrumental mass discrimination was corrected by normalization to the reference zircon GJ-1 ( Jackson et al., 2004 ). The drift-correction was done by applying a linear fit through the measured ratios for the GJ-1 standard. The Concordia ages were calculated with Isoplot ( Ludwig, 2003 ). Plešovice ( Sláma et al., 2008 ) and 91500 ( Wiedenbeck et al., 1995 ) secondary zircon standards were measured multiple times throughout each sequence and served as an accuracy check. For the Plešovice zircon standard, our long-term (47 analyses) mean Concordia age yields 338 ± 2 Ma, which is in excellent agreement with the reported ID-TIMS age of 337.1 ± 0.4 Ma ( Izmer et al., 2010 ). The results for all analyzed zircon grains (excluding the outliers; <10%), are listed in Table 3 and resulting Concordia or intercept ages are shown in Fig. 3 . Concordia diagrams are presented in Fig. 4 . 2.2 Apatite fission-track thermochronology The apatite fission-track (AFT) method is a low-temperature thermochronological technique based on the spontaneous fission decay of 238 U. Depending on the chemical composition of the apatite (especially Cl/F ratio, Green et al., 1986; Carlson et al., 1999 ) fission tracks in apatite become partially stable when cooled to about 125–100 °C. At these temperatures the tracks are shortened and their original length still decreases (partial annealing). When temperatures reach ∼60 °C the tracks in apatite are thought to be stable ( Wagner and Van den haute, 1992 and references therein) although some annealing at ambient temperatures might take place. Together with the AFT age, track length distributions form an important tool in AFT thermochronology ( Gleadow et al., 1986 ). The analytical procedures for AFT dating applied in this paper consist of two different techniques. A first technique is the traditional external detector method where apatite mounts are covered with an U-free external muscovite mica detector and then irradiated with thermal neutrons to produce induced 235 U fission tracks. Details on the procedures used in our laboratory can be found in De Grave and Van den haute (2002) and De Grave et al. (2009) for example, and are briefly outlined below. Apatites from samples KYR-10, KYR-13, AI-40, and AI-42 were embedded in epoxy, polished and analyzed with the ‘traditional’ external detector (ED) method ( Table 4 ). Spontaneous tracks were etched with a 2.5% HNO 3 solution for 70 s at 25 °C, induced tracks in the muscovite ED with 40% HF for 40 min at 20 °C. Irradiation was performed at the Belgian Reactor 1 (BR1) facility of the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre in Mol, where the well-thermalized channel ( f -ratio of 98) X26 was used ( De Grave et al., 2010 ) and a thermal neutron fluence of 2.23 × 10 15 cm −2 was achieved. This was monitored using metal activation monitors (diluted Au–Al and Co–Al alloys; Van den haute et al., 1998 ). AFT ages obtained for aforementioned samples are conventional ζ -ages ( Hurford, 1990 ) with an overall weighted mean zeta of 253.1 ± 2.4 a cm 2 (Durango and Fish Canyon Tuff apatite standards). The IRMM-540 dosimeter glass ( De Corte et al., 1998 ) was used. Glass shards were regularly spaced in the sample package to detect and correct for any axial thermal neutron fluence gradient and to allow interpolation of induced glass dosimeter track densities ( ρ d ) for individual samples. Where possible 100 natural confined tracks were measured in order to construct an AFT length-frequency distribution, a target that was not always attained. Especially in the young samples, low spontaneous track densities translate in insufficient numbers of measurable horizontal confined tracks. To enhance this number for a representative “young” sample, a duplicate epoxy mount of sample AI-40 (which had the most and the best-quality apatite grains of the “young” samples) was made and wrapped in Al-foil (Al-degrader). This mount was then irradiated with heavy ions at the linear accelerator of the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, Germany. The sample was irradiated with a Au-ion beam from the UNILAC linear accelerator at GSI. Au-ions were accelerated to ∼11.4 MeV/amu, corresponding to an initial energy of ∼2.25 GeV. We used an Al-degrader of ∼60 μm thick in order to reduce the energy of the impacting ions to ∼780 MeV at the apatite-surface. This allows us to reduce the ion penetration depth and associated length of ion-tracks in the apatite to values suitable for confined FT revelation ( Jonckheere et al., 2007 ). The resulting ion range was calculated using the SRIM-software ( Ziegler et al., 1985 ) and yielded ∼34 μm. More details on this procedure can be found in Jonckheere et al. (2007) and Min et al. (2007) . Thermal history modeling using the HeFTy software ( Ketcham, 2005 ) and the Ketcham et al. (2007) annealing-equations was performed on the two samples that yielded sufficient numbers of track lengths (AI-40 and KYR-13). Default settings of the HeFTy package were retained, except for the l o -value where 16.05 μm was used as constant and fixed value following our own, laboratory specific induced confined track length calibration. Samples KYR-06, KYR-07, KYR-12, AI-37 and AI-38 were dated using AFT LA-ICP-MS. The reason why these samples were dated by ICP-MS are purely practical and are associated with the fact that by the time latter samples were prepared for analysis our advances in using AFT LA-ICP-MS at our institute were proving successful. As analysis by ICP-MS in this particular case was also faster, we opted to apply this method. Using LA-ICP-MS for AFT dating is a relative new and experimental approach ( Hasebe et al., 2004 ) and merits and necessitates a somewhat more elaborate description of analytical procedures. In this approach parental 238 U concentrations are determined directly by ICP-MS. In the traditional ED method, this is done indirectly by irradiating the samples with thermal neutrons (e.g. Wagner and Van den haute, 1992 ). This induces 235 U fission tracks in the sample and in the contact surface of the muscovite ED in contact with the sample. Counting of the induced tracks gives a measure of 235 U concentration, which can be translated to 238 U concentrations as both isotopes in nature occur in constant ratio of 7.2527 × 10 −3 ( Steiger and Jäger, 1977 ). As irradiation facilities containing well-thermalized channels are becoming more scarce, and as irradiated materials and their transport poses specific risks and problems, ICP-MS analyses are proving a promising alternative ( Hasebe et al., 2004 ). For the ICP-MS approach, aforementioned samples were embedded in epoxy and polished in exactly the same manner as done for the ED method. However, while for the ED method each sample is individually embedded and a separate muscovite ED is attached to each mount, the mounts for AFT LA-ICP-MS dating are made larger (2.5 cm diameter) and thicker (∼1 cm) to fit exactly in the ablation cell. Several samples can hence be included in a single mount (row by row) as is usually done for LA-ICP-MS or SHRIMP ZUPb dating. A prismatic section of a single crystal of the Durango apatite age standard was co-embedded with each mount, as well as a row of SH-3 apatite, an “in-house standard” that we use for secondary, internal calibration. SH-3 is a slowly cooled diorite from the Siberian Altai basement ( De Grave et al., 2008a ) that contains large amounts of exceptionally good apatite grains. The SH-3 sample was dated with the traditional AFT-ED method at 93.1 ± 3.5 Ma using ζ -calibration and at 91.7 ± 3.4 Ma using absolute thermal neutron fluence dosimetry calibration ( De Grave et al., 2009; De Grave and Van den haute, 2002 ). These mounts, containing several apatite samples and standards were then etched to reveal the spontaneous fission tracks, using the same etching conditions as given above for the ED method. The mounts were mapped under a high-resolution zoom-stereomicroscope (Leica M16FA) equipped with a Colorview-I® digital camera (and AnalySIS® software). Spontaneous tracks were counted under a BH-2 microscope (1250 × magnification, dry objectives) using a calibrated micrometer grid of 60 μm by 60 μm. Micro-photographs of the grains were used to indicate the exact position of the counted surface. These exact same 60 μm by 60 μm surfaces were then analyzed for 238 U content by LA-ICP-MS using operational conditions listed in Table 2 . The LA-ICP-MS instrumental set-up is identical as for the U/Pb measurements, described earlier. LA-ICP-MS AFT ages were calculated following the method described by Hasebe et al. (2004) for a large extent, although some minor adaptations were made as outlined below. For each measurement (run), the 238 U signal intensity was calibrated against 44 Ca (internal standard), which is present in both the standards and the unknowns (apatite) as a matrix element. Calibration was performed using NIST 610 and NIST 612 glasses as primary standards, which were measured interspaced between 10 unknown apatite grains within one sequence. The resulting calibration lines are shown in Fig. 5 . The origin of the deviate signal sensitivity for sequence 3 and 4 versus sequence 1 and 2 is unclear but has no effect on the calculated U-concentration due to the repeated measurements of NIST-standards within each sequence. This was controlled using two secondary standards (accuracy check): Durango apatite and the SH-3 apatite as explained above ( Fig. 5 ). Although negligible, within-sequence instrumental drift-correction was performed based on the NIST 612 238 U/ 44 Ca output. The CaO-content is well-known for the NIST and Durango-standards (GEOREM preferred values – Jochum and Stoll, 2008; Seifert et al., 2000 ). For SH-3 and the unknown apatite samples, CaO-content was measured using SEM-EDX (JEOL JSM-6400) and calibrated against Durango apatite (CaO measured: 55.7 ± 0.8 wt.% (1 σ ); CaO reference: 54.0 ± 0.2 wt.% (1 σ ), Seifert et al., 2000 ; Table 5 ). The LA-ICP-MS AFT ages were calculated using an absolute approach, which is based on the 238 U total decay constant and the 238 U spontaneous fission-decay constant. Therefore, the age-equation of Hasebe et al. (2004) was used, (1) t = 1 λ D ln 1 + ρ S λ D M λ f N A 238 U 10 - 6 dR sp k where λ D = 238 U total decay constant (1.55125 × 10 −10 a −1 , Jaffey et al., 1971 ), λ f = 238 U spontaneous fission-decay constant (8.46 × 10 −17 a −1 , Galliker et al., 1970; Wagner and Van den haute, 1992 ), N A = Avogadro’s number (6.02214 × 10 23 mol −1 ), d = apatite density (3.19 g/cm 2 as in Hasebe et al., 2004 ), M = the atomic mass of 238 U (238.0508 amu), k = observational parameter = 1 are constants. 238 U is the measured 238-Uranium concentration (in μg/g) in the sample, ρ s is the spontaneous fission track density (in tracks/cm 2 ) and R sp is a registration factor, and corresponds to the range or to half of the measured mean confined fission-track length. The total uncertainty on this age (for each analyzed grain) is given by ( Hasebe et al., 2004 ): (2) age uncertainty = t 1 N S 2 + δ 2 where t = the calculated AFT age, N s = the number of counted spontaneous fission tracks, δ = total uncertainty in 238 U concentration (propagated uncertainty, generally 5–10%). The results are reported in Table 5 . In our calculations, we used R sp = 7.25 for the Durango apatite age standard, which is half of the average mean confined FT length for fossil tracks in this standard ( l m ∼ 14.5 μm; Jonckheere et al., 2007; Glorie et al., 2010b ). For sample SH-3, half of the actually measured mean confined FT length of 6.6 μm was used ( De Grave et al., 2009 ). In samples AI-37 and AI-38, the number of confined tracks was not sufficient and no sample specific R sp -value could be measured. We therefore used R sp = 7.05 μm, which is the measured mean confined FT length for sample AI-40, a rapidly cooled basement sample with a similar AFT age (and thermal history) and a similar crystallization age and lithology. For the detrital apatite samples from the southern edge of the Alai Valley (KYR-06; KYR-07), several age components could be identified. We used RadialPlotter ( Vermeesch, 2009 ) to visualize the different components and calculated a central age for each age-group ( Fig. 6 ). Although the number of analyzed grains is relatively low for these sedimentary samples due to reasons of apatite grain quality, three major age components could be distinguished for both samples, while an additional younger component for KYR-06 was found as well. For these samples, R sp = 7.05 μm was used, the value for the fast cooled basement samples. We are aware that this might introduce a small bias in the age of the age components that cooled slower, which is possibly the case for the Cretaceous components. In theory, these ages can hence be seen as minimum ages, with the true AFT age being 10% older at most. Given the cooling ages and modeled tT paths for the Cretaceous KYR-13 sample ( Fig. 7 ) however, we are confident that the R sp values adopted here do not introduce significant errors. 2.3 Apatite (U–Th–Sm)/He thermochronology The apatite (U–Th–Sm)/He (AHe) method is even more sensitive to low-temperature perturbations (order of magnitude ∼40–80 °C) than the AFT technique and is thus a more sensitive thermochronometer. It is based on the diffusion of radiogenic 4 He through the crystal lattice at elevated temperatures ( Stockli et al., 2000; Ehlers and Farley, 2003 ) and it is an ideally suited complementary technique to AFT. While sample preparation was carried out in our facilities, He analysis was performed at the (U–Th)/He laboratory of Kansas State University (USA) and analytical procedures are described in detail e.g. by Farley and Stockli (2002) . Apatite grains were selected under a high-resolution zoom-stereomicroscope equipped with polarized light to exclude even the smallest inclusions. The three most ideally suited grains (no inclusions, transparent, euhedrical hexagonal prisms) were loaded in separate platinum sleeves (Pt tubes). Each grain is photographed and the crystal’s dimensions were determined to allow for α -ejection correction based on the F T ejection correction method ( Farley, 2002; Farley et al., 1996 ). Sample aliquots in the Pt sleeves were heated by a 20 W Nd-YAG laser ( House et al., 2000 ) to fuse the grains in the Pt and evacuate the 4 He gas from the mineral lattice. The 4 He was measured by isotope dilution ( 3 He spike), after gettering and cryogenic purification, with a Blazers Prisma QMS-200 quadrupole mass spectrometer. After dissolution, U, Th and Sm concentrations were determined by a VG Plasmaquad-2 ICP-MS. Results for the AHe analyses are listed in Table 6 , and ages are ploted on the map in Fig. 3 . 3 Results 3.1 Zircon U/Pb dating Zircon U/Pb dating results are presented in Table 3 and corresponding Concordia plots and age results are presented in Fig. 5 . Ages are also indicated on the map in Fig. 3 . The granites in the northern-central part of the Alai Range (Kokbulak Mountains, Belauli and Askaly bodies) yield a zircon U/Pb age of 283.7 ± 3.5 Ma (sample AI-37). This zircon crystallization age suggests that the granites were emplaced in the Early to Middle Permian. Sample KYR-11 from the amphibolitic contact aureole of the Belauli and Askaly plutons does not exhibit a clear concordant age. Pb-loss during the thermal metamorphic event might be responsible for this shift from Concordia. A lower intercept age of 287 ± 38 Ma could be deduced from this data. This coincides with the granite crystallization age of AI-37 and constrains the thermal metamorphic event. Samples AI-40 and AI-42 from the granites in the southern part of the Alai Range, from the Dzhaman-Dzhailiuski, Sary-Mogol and Balyktinski intrusions have a somewhat younger age with respect to AI-37. Concordant zircon crystallization ages were found to be 274.4 ± 7.0 Ma (AI-40) and 263.7 ± 4.7 Ma (AI-42), corresponding to a Middle Permian (Guadalupian) formation of these intrusives. 3.2 Apatite fission-track thermochronology Results from AFT dating and length measurement can best be described in three groups. A first group only contains a single sample, KYR-13. This sample is a Late Carboniferous–Permian conglomerate ( Fig. 3 ) from a molasse unit containing granitic clasts, presumably from the Permian granites in the vicinity. The sample (including granitic clasts and sandy matrix) was dated by the traditional AFT-ED method and gave an apparent mean Early Cretaceous AFT age of 117.8 ± 6.5 Ma. The length distribution for this sample produces a mean length of 12.64 μm, with standard deviation of 1.23 μm ( Fig. 7 , Table 4 ). These values suggest a relatively long residence time in the Apatite Partial Annealing Zone ( Wagner and Van den haute, 1992 ) and are typical for slowly cooled basement rocks ( Gleadow et al., 1986 ). The Early Cretaceous apparent AFT age of the sample can hence be interpreted as a cooling age through APAZ temperatures. This further suggests that between deposition in the Late Carboniferous–Permian and cooling in the Early Cretaceous, the sample was heated to temperatures exceeding partial annealing conditions, i.e. temperatures in excess of 110–120 °C. The extent of heating was sufficient to reset all apatites (from the granitic clasts as well as from the matrix), resulting in the complete annealing of the pre-Early Cretaceous signal. The most plausible explanation for this observation is that the Late Carboniferous–Permian molasse unit was buried by Early and Middle Mesozoic sediments to the extent sedimentary load reached a threshold whereafter complete resetting of the AFT “clock” could occur (burial induced heating). After this, from a thermochronology viewpoint, this sample can be considered as a “basement” sample with its specific Late Mesozoic to recent cooling history. Early Cretaceous denudation of the Early and Middle Mesozoic overburden would then have exhumed the sample and brought it back in APAZ temperatures. The fact that the AFT lengths have a unimodal distribution and clearly show shortening, implies that the Early Cretaceous event was insufficient to bring the sample completely to the (sub)surface and that it was subjected to partial annealing for a non-negligible amount of time. This qualitative description is reflected in the thermal history model for this sample ( Fig. 7 ): after Early to Middle Mesozoic total annealing, an Early Cretaceous event between ∼140 and 110 Ma places the Late Carboniferous–Permian conglomerate back in the APAZ. After a period of Late Cretaceous–Early Cenozoic stability, a Late Cenozoic cooling event is ultimately responsible for final cooling of the conglomerate to present outcrop temperatures. Initiation of this latest “basement” cooling is modeled at ∼15–20 Ma ( Fig. 7 ). This corresponds to the denudation of the modern Tien Shan orogen and is underscored by the basement cooling ages obtained in this study (see below). A second group of samples is represented by detrital apatites from sandstones originating from both the southeastern Ferghana Basin (sample KYR-12) and the Alai Basin and Trans Alai Range (samples KYR-06 and KYR-07). These basins border the current Alai (and Kichi-Alai) Ranges to the north and south respectively. All samples from this group were dated using AFT LA-ICP-MS. Although care was taken to extract as many good quality apatites as possible, the amount of datable grains was not always high. Nevertheless several age populations (central ages) could clearly be distinguished in the detrital samples ( Fig. 6 , Table 5 ). Sample KYR-12, a Cretaceous sandstone from the southeastern Ferghana Basin ( Fig. 8 ) only shows one age population of 223.0 ± 19.3 Ma. As a “reset” Triassic age due to burial and heating for the Cretaceous sandstone is obviously not possible, the sandstone hence contains non-reset detrital apatites from a source region that apparently cooled in the Late Triassic (Carnian). A Late Triassic age component was also found for the Trans-Alai samples ( Fig. 6 ), however, the ages are somewhat younger than for the Ferghana Basin sample: 208.0 ± 16.6 Ma (KYR-07) and 206.6 ± 12.2 Ma (KYR-06) (Norian). Both Trans-Alai samples subsequently contain a Late Cretaceous (Campanian) age component of 80.7 ± 7.0 Ma (KYR-07) and 71.8 ± 7.8 Ma (KYR-06). An Early Miocene (Burdigalian) component of 18.9 ± 3.1 Ma (KYR-07) and 18.4 ± 1.7 Ma (KYR-06) is also recognized in both samples. An even younger, Late Pliocene age population of 3.3 ± 0.7 Ma is only found in sample KYR-06. Sample KYR-07 represents the basal units of the Neogene Trans-Alai sediments, and was sampled close to the Oligocene outcrops ( Fig. 8 ). KYR-06 was taken from the upper Neogene section and not-surprisingly therefore is the only sample hosting the youngest age population. Samples KYR-07 and KYR-06 correlate to the Late Oligocene–Middle Miocene Massaget Complex and the Middle Miocene–Pliocene Baktry Formation in the Central Alai Valley respectively ( Coutand et al., 2002 ). The aforementioned age components preserved in the detrital record are also found in several localities within the Tien Shan basement rocks (e.g. De Grave et al., 2008b ) were they appear to pinpoint several cooling events affecting the Tien Shan basement during Meso-Cenozoic reactivation episodes. However the age components for these three samples might also in part represent mixed ages. Without track length data this cannot be ruled out. Given the limited amount of datable grains, insufficient amount of confined tracks were found for these samples. Finally, a third group is represented by granitic basement rocks from the northern-central Alai Range (Kokbulak Mountains, Belauli and Askaly plutons, samples KYR-10, AI-37 and AI-38) and the southern Alai Range (Dzhaman-Dzhailiuski, Sary-Mogol and Balyktinski intrusions, samples AI-40, AI-41, and AI-42). Samples AI-37 and AI-38 were dated with the AFT LA-ICP-MS method ( Table 5 ), while for the other three, the more traditional ED method was applied ( Table 4 ). All these granite samples render young AFT ages ( Fig. 3 ) and low spontaneous track densities. No clear AFT age – elevation trends could be observed. Only for sample AI-40, which contained the most and best-quality apatite grains, enough grains were present to allow a significant track length measurement and thermal history modeling ( Fig. 7 ). Even so, confined track densities had to be enhanced by using heavy-ion bombardment and only 40 lengths could be measured. All AFT ages are Early Miocene with 18.8 ± 1.6 Ma (AI-37), 15.9 ± 1.5 Ma (KYR-10) and 14.0 ± 1.4 Ma (AI-38) in the north, and Early to Late Miocene with 22.3 ± 1.1 Ma (AI-42) and 8.4 ± 0.3 Ma (AI-40) in the south of the Alai Range. The mean track length for AI-40 is 14.00 μm with a standard deviation of 1.18 μm, suggestive of a rapid and recent cooling. When performing thermal history modeling the young AFT age and long AFT track lengths (with added AHe – input) not surprisingly produce an envelope of good fit tT paths that pass the APAZ rapidly during the past ∼10 Ma. The Miocene ages for the granitic basement correspond to the Miocene age components in the detrital samples (group 2, above) and to the modelled Late Cenozoic cooling for the Early Cretaceous sample KYR-13 (group 1, above). All these point to an Early Miocene onset of denudation of the Kyrgyz Southern Tien Shan and the leading edge of the advancing Pamir thrust nappes. 3.3 Apatite (U–Th–Sm)/He thermochronology For the southern Alai Range samples from the Dzhaman-Dzhailiuski, Sary-Mogol and Balyktinski intrusions (AI-40, AI-41, and AI-42), apatite (U–Th–Sm)/He (AHe) ages were obtained as well ( Table 6 ). With respect to the AFT ages, the AHe ages are younger, as the closure temperature of the latter system is lower. The acquired AHe ages are Late Miocene–Early Pliocene and thus further corroborate the Miocene cooling of the Alai crystalline basement during denudation of the growing orogen. AHe analyses were done in triplicate. The three single grain aliquots for samples AI-40 and AI-42 all generated reproducible ( F T corrected) Late Miocene–Early Pliocene ages and yield an average of 5.0 ± 0.3 Ma and 9.7 ± 0.6 Ma respectively. Sample AI-41 did not contain sufficient good quality apatites and its AFT mount did not include datable grains at all. Also the selected AHe grains proved of low quality and two aliquots had to be rejected ( Table 5 ). A first AI-41 aliquot did not release any radiogenic helium gas, while the grain from a second aliquot produced unsupported, parentless 4 He, probably originating from undetected and indissolvable U- and/or Th-rich micro-inclusions. A last aliquot however rendered a Late Miocene AHe age of 12.5 ± 0.8 Ma that fits nicely with both other AHe ages and hence, while only from one aliquot, it is considered to be a reliable age. 4 Interpretation and discussion 4.1 Zircon U/Pb data The geochronologic and thermochronologic data presented here pinpoint several events in the tectonic evolution of the Alai region geology in an absolute timeframe. All ages obtained with the various techniques are schematically shown in Fig. 9 A and span the Late Palaeozoic to the present. A first age signal is represented by the Early to Middle Permian emplacement ages of the granitic intrusion in the Alai region of the STS. In the northern-central part of the Alai Range (Kokbulak Mountains, Belauli and Askaly bodies) we find an Early Permian emplacement and associated thermal metamorphism of ∼285 Ma. In the southern part of the Alai Range (Dzhaman-Dzhailiuski, Sary-Mogol and Balyktinski intrusions) a somewhat younger age of ∼274–264 Ma is found, corresponding to the Middle Permian Guadalupian Epoch. These Permian ages correspond to a well-known episode of post-collisional magmatism of which signs are ubiquitous throughout the entire Tien Shan orogen. The post-collisional granitoids appear in all composing tectonic units of the Tien Shan and hence their intrusion occurred when the ancestral Tien Shan was amalgamated completely. The ages found in the Alai segment and reported in this paper, especially the older ones of ∼285 Ma, correspond well with ages published for the Kokshaal segment of the Kyrgyz STS ( Konopelko et al., 2007, 2009; Seltmann et al., in press ). These authors report (mainly SHRIMP) zircon U/Pb ages between about 299 and 279 Ma. Rb/Sr isochron ages of 275–269 Ma from the Kokshaal plutons are reported by Solomovich and Trifonov (2002) . For the Kyzylkum segment of the STS, Seltmann et al. (in press) give an overview of Early Permian post-collisional magmatism with emplacement ages of 293–276 Ma. In the Middle Tien Shan ages for the Permian post-collisional magmatism range from about 294 to 279 Ma ( Alekseev et al., 2009; Konopelko et al., 2009; Seltmann et al., in press ). In the Kyrgyz Northern Tien Shan ages of 292 Ma are found ( Glorie et al., 2010a; Seltmann et al., in press ). In the Chinese part of the Southern Tien Shan, Long et al. (2008) and Gao et al. (2009) report ages of 285–280 Ma for post-collisional igneous complexes there and Wang et al. (2009a,b ; and references therein) report Permian intrusion ages of about 290–260 Ma in the Northern and Central Chinese Tien Shan. Many of these “Hercynian” post-collisional granitoids are associated with important ore deposits (mainly Au) that have been dated to the Early Permian, ranging roughly between 280 and 290 Ma ( Mao et al., 2004; Morelli et al., 2007 ). In general our ages from the Alai segment of the Kyrgyz STS of ∼285–264 are within the youngest range, or in all, consistently slightly younger than those listed above from the NTS, MTS, Kokshaal segment of STS in Kyrgyzstan and the Chinese STS. The Permian post-collisional plutons across the Tien Shan are related to the final amalgamation stage of the ancestral Tien Shan orogen and of the CAOB as a whole. The ancestral Tien Shan was constructed when frontal collision of the palaeo-Kazakhstan continent with (Karakum)-Tarim occurred ( Allen et al., 1992, 1995; Carroll et al., 1995; Gao et al., 1998; Heubeck, 2001; Windley et al., 2007; Xiao et al., 2010 ). Next to the development of post-collisional igneous complexes, this large-scale orogenic event produced significant relief in the Tien Shan orogen and thick Permian molasse type deposits accumulated in the foreland and intramontane basins (e.g. Graham et al., 1993 ). The conglomerate KYR-13 sample comes from such a deposit on the southeastern margin of the Ferghana Basin. 4.2 Apatite low-temperature basement and detrital thermochronology In the Early Mesozoic (possibly already to some extent in the Middle to Late Permian) the KYR-13 sample was buried under a thick sedimentary sequence. Detrital apatites from a Cretaceous sandstone (KYR-12) from the southeastern Ferghana Basin in the vicinity of the KYR-13 sample site, record sediment influx in the Ferghana Basin from a source area characterized by an apparent Late Triassic AFT cooling age of ∼223 Ma. A Late Triassic age component in the Late Cenozoic sediments (KYR-06 and KYR-07) along the Trans-Alai Range is present as well. For the latter samples the Late Triassic ages are a bit younger, around ∼207 Ma. In the Tien Shan post-Late Triassic denudation has largely erased this thermochronologic signal from the basement rocks, although in some distinct areas (most notably on the Song-Kul Plateau, Fig. 2 , De Grave et al., 2008b ), remnant AFT Triassic cooling ages are preserved. Also in distinct parts of the Chinese Tien Shan several authors report Late Triassic AFT cooling ages ( Dumitru et al., 2001; Sobel et al., 2006a ) although there as well, this age component is rather rare and only present in the detrital record. Far less, if at all, in the basement. In any case, these AFT ages point toward a Late Triassic episode of basement cooling through denudation and subsequent deposition of the eroded sediments. In the region Late Triassic to Early Palaeogene sediments are ubiquitous and form deposits of several kilometers thick in the Ferghana Basin ( Burov et al., 1990; Tursungaziev and Petrov, 2008 ). This episode is contemporaneous with the collision of the Cimmerian (“Tibetan”) block of Qiangtang with the then southern (southeastern) (Eur)Asia margin of the evolving Pangean supercontinent along the Jinsha suture south of Tarim (northern Tibet and across the Pamir blocks) (e.g. Yin and Harrison, 2000 and references therein; Schwab et al., 2004 ). The collision–accretion of Qiangtang resulted in tectonic reactivation in the Tien Shan orogen as seen in the structural geologic, sedimentary and thermochronologic record (e.g. Hendrix et al., 1992; Allen et al., 1993; Graham et al., 1993; Dumitru et al., 2001; Vincent and Allen, 2001 ). We interpret the Late Triassic detrital AFT age signal (as Late Triassic cooling ages of the source basement) in the southeastern Ferghana Basin and the Trans-Alai as related to this event ( Fig. 9 ). A next ‘signal’ detected in our thermochronologic dataset from the Alai area is picked up in the Early Cretaceous ( Fig. 9 A). A Permian conglomerate from a Late Carboniferous–Permian molasse unit at the Alai Range–Ferghana Basin transition yields an AFT cooling age of ∼118 Ma (sample KYR-13). This attests to the fact that Early Mesozoic (and probably also to some extent Late Permian) sediments buried this unit sufficiently deep to cause heating above Apatite Partial Annealing Zone (APAZ) temperatures and to thus erase any pre-existing AFT signal. At that time the apatites in this sample were reset and record subsequent cooling in the Early Cretaceous. Thermal history modeling based on the AFT age and length data of sample KYR-13 (no AHe data available) confirms that the sample was rapidly cooled in the Early Cretaceous between ∼140 and 110 Ma ( Fig. 7 ). This predates to some extent the deposition of the Cretaceous sediments from which KYR-12 was sampled. These “KYR-12” sediments are in any case older than the Cenomanian (∼100–95 Ma) clays and marls above. Unlike the Late Triassic component, Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous AFT basement cooling ages and detrital AFT age populations are prevalent throughout the entire Kyrgyz and Chinese Tien Shan (e.g. Sobel and Dumitru, 1997; Bullen et al., 2001; Dumitru et al., 2001; Sobel et al., 2006a,b; De Grave et al., 2008b; Wang et al., 2009a,b; Glorie et al., 2010a; Jolivet et al., 2010 ). This widespread Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous event is probably related to the collision of the Cimmerian Lhasa block with (Eur)Asia along the Bangong–Nujiang suture in Tibet (e.g. Yin and Harrison, 2000 and references therein). This suture continues to the Rushan–Pshart suture in the Pamirs ( Ducea et al., 2003; Schwab et al., 2004 ). The collision–accretion of Lhasa again resulted in tectonic reactivation in the Tien Shan orogen (e.g. Hendrix et al., 1992; Allen et al., 1993; Graham et al., 1993; Otto, 1997; Dumitru et al., 2001; Vincent and Allen, 2001 ). We therefore interpret the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous cooling event from the northern Alai “basement” as denudation directly linked to the Lhasa collision ( Fig. 9 ). The younger, Late Cenozoic Trans-Alai sandstones (KYR-06 and KYR-07) do not contain a “typical Tien Shan” (Late Jurassic)–Early Cretaceous age population. However they do reveal a Late Cretaceous component ( Figs. 6 and 9 ). This age component may be associated by yet another collision of Cimmerian or Tethyan terranes with southern (Eur)Asia that transpired chiefly in the “Pamir region” sensu lato. Several smaller blocks or a composite of these was accreted in the Tethyan Eurasian margin in the Late Cretaceous and principally involves the Karakoram block, the Koshistan Arc and the Hindu Kush. These basically form the backbone of the current Southern Pamirs ( Ducea et al., 2003; Schwab et al., 2004 ) and amalgamation of these blocks induced tectonic activity in the current Pamir–Tien Shan transitional region, and invoked denudation and cooling of basement units and deposition of these “cooled” apatites in the Alai/Trans-Alai Basin where they define the detrital Late Cretaceous AFT component. The latest Mesozoic and the Early Cenozoic for a large part represent a period of tectonic stability and quiescence with the formation of a typical lateritic peneplanation surface across the Tien Shan (e.g. Burbank et al., 1999 ) and in the Ferghana Basin and adjoining ranges in particular ( Bazhenov, 1993 ). No detrital age components from this period are found in our samples, nor do we find basement cooling ages in this time slice. The thermal history modeling of sample KYR-13 indeed describes a prolonged period of stability ( Fig. 7 ) during which the apatites of this particular sample stayed more or less at the temperatures they had reached after cessation of the protracted Mesozoic reactivation and associated denudation – basement cooling events. For this specific sample, this implies that the apatites were kept at upper APAZ temperatures for the better part of ∼100 Ma. This then caused the partial annealing of the fossil AFT lengths of the sample as observed in its length distribution ( Fig. 7 ). Finally, our data confirms that the current ongoing phase of cooling and denudation of the Alai basement commenced around 20–22 Ma ago, in the Early Miocene. Basement AFT cooling ages range from 22 to 8 Ma, basement AHe ages are situated between 12 and 5 Ma, thermal history modeling (AFT data KYR-13) shows basement cooling from ∼20 Ma onwards, and lastly, detrital AFT ages show two Late Cenozoic age populations: (1) Early Miocene of ∼18 Ma, and (2) Pliocene, ∼3 Ma. This puts an absolute time frame on the Late Cenozoic evolution of the Alai segment of the Kyrgyz Southern Tien Shan (STS). The modern Turkestan, Alai and Kichi-Alai Ranges of the STS and the Tien Shan orogen as a whole, developed as a direct consequence of continued indentation of the Indian plate into the Eurasian continent. While convergence is accommodated through escape tectonics, mainly evident in Southeast Asia and Tibet, and by crustal thickening in the Himalayan orogen and the Tibetan Plateau, progressing strain is also partitioned to the intracontinental interior of Central Asia. In this way, the CAOB is being reactivated as a distal effect of India–Eurasia collision and has developed into the world’s largest and most active intracontinental accretionary orogen. Miocene and Pliocene basement cooling and detrital age populations in other parts of the Tien Shan have been recognized by others as well (e.g. Hendrix et al., 1994; Sobel and Dumitru, 1997; Bullen et al., 2001; Dumitru et al., 2001; Sobel et al., 2006a,b; De Grave et al., 2008b; Wang et al., 2009a,b ). The detrital age populations for the Trans-Alai samples presented in this paper ( Figs. 6 and 9A ) moreover correspond well with observations by Sonntag et al. (2010) and fits within the local tectonic frame work outlined by Coutand et al. (2002) and Strecker et al. (2003) . In addition, Leloup et al. (2011) recently showed that strike-slip faulting along the Karakoram fault has been active since about 22–25 Ma ago. This fault zone is a major strike-slip zone along which the Pamir and Karakoram blocks are moving northward, converging toward the Tien Shan. As outlined in the introduction and geological setting section, a Late Cenozoic, in particular Miocene–Pliocene building of the modern Tien Shan is inferred from several lines of evidence and from various fields in geosciences. In particular successful in recent years magnetostratigraphic analysis of Neogene sedimentary sequences in the Tien Shan and adjoining basins have revealed pulsed denudation of the Tien Shan through the Miocene, Pliocene, and Pleistocene (e.g. Bullen et al., 2001; Charreau et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2007; Heermance et al., 2008 amongst others). 5 Conclusions By using a multi-method geo- and thermochronology strategy in dating basement samples from the Alai-Turkestan region of the Kyrgyz Southern Tien Shan and detrital samples from the adjoining Ferghana Basin (north) and the Alai Basin/Trans-Alai Range (south), a consistent Late Palaeozoic to recent thermo-tectonic history can be reconstructed. (1) Permian closure of the Turkestan Ocean between Tarim and the amalgamated palaeo-Kazakhstan with fringing Tien Shan units resulted in collision between these large blocks and formation of the ancestral Tien Shan orogen wedged in between. This collision is associated with large-scale emplacement of post-collision type granitoids across all boundaries of the composing Tien Shan units. In the Alai segment of the Kyrgyz Southern Tien Shan zircon U/Pb emplacement ages and thermal metamorphism ages of associated contact aureoles were found to be between ∼284 and 263 Ma (Middle Permian). (2) Carboniferous–Permian molasse units related to the aforementioned collision–accretion event were later buried under a thick blanket of Early–Middle Mesozoic sediments. Pre-existing apatite fission-track (AFT) information from the Permian units was consequently erased and the AFT “clock” was reset at that moment. Detrital apatites from Mesozoic sediments in the southeastern Ferghana Basin, yield Late Triassic source rock cooling ages of ∼223 Ma. Younger, Late Cenozoic, sediments from the Trans-Alai Range also exhibit this Late Triassic age component, although it was found to be somewhat younger in that region (∼207 Ma). Denudation of a reactivated Mesozoic Tien Shan orogen is thought to lie at the origin of this detrital AFT age component. The timing is coeval with the collision–accretion of the Cimmerian Qiangtang unit at the southern (Eur)Asian margin. (3) Late Carboniferous–Permian molasse units at the present-day Ferghana Basin–Alai Range transition exhibit an Early Cretaceous apparent AFT age. When modeled using thermal history reconstruction software, these ages and the associated AFT length distributions predict an important Early Cretaceous cooling event (∼140–110 Ma) affecting this area. This event exhumed the rocks near this basin–range transition to upper crustal levels. This exhumation event identifies a renewed pulse of Mesozoic Tien Shan reactivation and is contemporaneous with the collision–accretion of the Cimmerian Lhasa unit at the southern (Eur)Asian margin. (4) Late Cenozoic sediments in the Trans-Alai Range contain a younger, Late Cretaceous detrital AFT age population of ∼75 Ma. This implies that near the current Tien Shan–Pamir transition, source rocks were exhumed at that time and attained these Late Cretaceous cooling ages. This points to ongoing reactivation of the Tien Shan, simultaneous to accretion of the Karakoram block and associated units in the (Eur)Asian Tethyan margin. (5) The modern Tien Shan orogen was constructed as a distal effect of India–Eurasia convergence in the Late Cenozoic. This important event is recorded both in the basement and the detrital apatite samples. Early Miocene AFT ages of the granitic basement are established at ∼22 and 14 Ma and reveal the cooling of the basement as it is being exhumed and the eroded material is being deposited in the adjoining basins. A detrital age population of ∼18 Ma can be found in the Trans-Alai. Moreover, when performing thermal history modeling on the Carboniferous–Permian molasse apatite sample with an apparent Early Cretaceous age, a relevant cooling episode initiating at around 20 Ma is revealed. (6) Finally, one granite basement sample from the southern Alai Range yields a Late Miocene AFT age of ∼8 Ma. A Pliocene age component of ∼3 Ma is also present in the Trans Alai detrital samples. Late Miocene–Pliocene apatite (U–Th–Sm)/He cooling ages from the basement of the southern Alai Range imply final exhumation started between ∼12 and 5 Ma.

They are hosted in Lower
 Liassic or Upper Jurassic reef limestones, and the overlying condensed Carixian phosphatic limestones and Campanian marls,
 respectively. The mineralization occurs in three types of orebodies: stratiform replacement heaps and lenses (Jebel Stah and
 Hammam Zriba), breccia fillings and dissolution void fillings (Sidi Taya) and lodes (Jebel Oust). More than one generation
 of fluorite is observed in the stratiform deposits. Microthermometric analyses of the inclusion fluids observed in fluorite
 and quartz show that the economic concentrations of fluorite have deposited from moderate to highly saline (12–22.5 wt% NaCl
 equivalents) hydrothermal (110–160 �C) mineralizing fluids at the center (Jebel Stah, Sidi Taya) and to the east of the province
 (Hammam Zriba). Late remobilizations, observed in the stratiform deposits, are related to the circulation of a warmer (up
 to 185 �C) but less saline (10 wt% NaCl equivalents) fluid (Jebel Stah) and more saline (12–22 wt% NaCl equivalents) fluid
 (Hammam Zriba). The highest temperature (up to 250 �C) and salinity (32–34 wt% NaCl equivalents) are observed to the west
 of the province of Zaghouan (Jebel Oust). Less saline (3–6 wt% NaCl equivalents) and moderately hot to hot fluids (up to 220 � 20 �C)
 and rich in gaseous CO2 invade most of the ore deposits in later stages and give rise to the massive quartz within fractures at Jebel Stah. Chemical
 analyses of the fluids extracted from the inclusions occuring in fluorite show compositions dominated by the presence of Na+, Ca2+ and Cl− ionic species and allow the mean temperature of the fluids in the source reservoir to be estimated as 275 � 25 �C. The circulation
 of the ore-forming fluids is triggered by a regional tectonic extensional phase which occurs within the post-Jurassic to ante-Miocene
 time interval. The deposition of the economic concentrations of fluorite resulted from the decrease in pressure and temperature
 of the hydrothermal brines (Jebel Oust), along with the increase in the dissolved calcium activity (Jebel Stah and Sidi Taya),
 or a decrease in salinity due to the mixing with a hot, less saline and Na-poor, Ca-rich fluid (Hammam Zriba). The mineralogical
 associations (CaF2, PbS, ZnS, BaSO4) hosted within carbonate rocks, the temperatures and the salinities of the fluids that gave rise to the more important ore
 deposits (110–160 �C and 12–22.5 wt% NaCl equivalents), their composition (Na, Ca, Cl) and the molar ratios between the major
 ionic species, as well as the presence of liquid hydrocarbons in the mineralizing fluids, show that the ore deposits of the
 province of Zaghouan belong to the carbonate-hosted F, Pb, Zn, Ba Mississippi Valley-type deposits.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/60/E4/C1/60E4C12B35F28AA0EB16F28A1E26AC8A.pdf

A 'Fe-migration model' is presented in which magnetite is formed under different diagenetic conditions. During sulphate reduction, originally formed ('primary') magnetite is preserved. This primary magnetite has recorded the pre-transitional normal polarity. After burial, migration of ferrous iron occurs and subsequent oxidation produces 'secondary magnetite', which records the post-transitional reversed polarity and produces the two apparent transitions. In addition, low temperature (LT) and high temperature (HT) components record the reversal in a slightly different way: the HT component being acquired with a delay. It is probable that both components reside in magnetite but have a different origin and grain size distribution, giving different blocking temperature spectra.

Turbodrills, and later, positive displacement motors (PDMs), were introduced to capitalize on these benefits. Both Turbodrills and PDMs convert hydraulic energy in the drilling fluid into mechanical power at the bit. With a Turbodrill, this power conversion is accomplished through the use of turbine blades, and with a PDM, it is accomplished through a seal between an eccentrically rotating steel rotor and an elastomer stator. While there are many benefits to the use of turbine blades to create mechanical power from hydraulic power, their superior efficiency at relatively high output speeds stands out. The rotational speed generated at the bit is not ideal for certain applications, however. The industry recognized this situation in the 1920s, and the development of the geared Turbodrill was initiated. By including reduction gearing in a Turbodrill, high rotating speeds generated by the turbine can be converted into lower RPM and higher torque at the bit. For decades, there have been attempts to develop a successful geared Turbodrill. Until recently, these efforts have realized little success. Design work performed with the latest software technology and modern materials have now resulted in a very successful, high power, high torque geared Turbodrill. With the new possibility of decreasing output RPM, and increasing the available torque, the range of applications in which Turbodrills perform favorably is significantly expanded. The focus of this paper will be to identify applications in which the deployment of a gear reduced Turbodrill will be advantageous. This paper will also analyze three recent North Sea case histories, in which geared Turbodrills, together with PDC bits, were run successfully to drill a 12–1/4"" hole section through the upper Cretaceous chalk down to the upper Permian Zechstein formation. One of these cases involved running the new geared Turbodrill (NGT) with a rotary steerable system. Analysis of these runs will detail proposed versus actual drilling curves including an in-depth discussion on all parameters encountered during drilling. Introduction Over the years, drilling technology in the Dutch sector of the North Sea has evolved in an attempt to overcome many drilling challenges. In the K12 field, this section is typically from 6,000 to 7,000 feet long, and often includes a significant amount of directional work. It also includes a wide variety of formations, including chalk sections, chert, dolomite, sandstone, marl, claystones, siltstones, shales and anhydrites. The interval has historically been drilled with a wide variety of PDC drill bits on PDMs and on rotary. Originally, drilling the 16"" hole, with an oil based mud (OBM), commenced through the top of the chert and into the chalk, where 13–3/8"" casing was set. The casing program was later optimized, allowing 13–3/8"" casing to be set at the bottom of the North Sea formation. The 12–1/4"" section was started using an insert bit on rotary drive to drill out the shoe track and continue drilling through the chert. When the chalk was reached, the BHA was changed to utilize a PDC bit driven by a PDM. After drilling through the chalk, the BHA was changed back to the insert bit driven by rotary to penetrate the bottom chert. At the end of the bottom chert section, the BHA was changed back to a PDC bit driven by a PDM to complete the 12–1/4"" interval. The 6,000 to 7,000 foot interval was historically drilled using OBM. Overall drilling economics are highly dependent on reducing the time, and subsequent cost, through this section. It is also imperative to hold angle through this section so the reservoir targets can be reached effectively. For this reason, continual improvements, to drill faster and hold angle through this section, are being evaluated. In early 2003, technological advancements in geared turbodrill technology progressed to the point where it warranted an attempt to evaluate performance through this section. The use of the NGT produced faster penetration rates and allowed the chalk section to be drilled with salt water versus OBM. Changing the mud system through this section of the interval resulted in better cost economics and eliminated the loss of cuttings that had historically been prevalent.",,

The tuffs are characterised as ash-, fine ash- and in some cases as welded ash tuffs. Crystal-,lappili- and breccia tuffs also occur. The tuffs are built up of glass shards, pumice shards and crystal fragments which are cemented by glassy material. Crystal fragments are represented by quartz crystals. Plagioclase, albite, sanidine and biotite exist as well. Essentially, the vitric parts of the tuffs are altered to zeolites (heulandite 2 and/or mordenite, analcime, laumontite / scolecite), clay minerals (smectite, kaolinite +/or mixed layer I/S of regular type), Si02 minerals (quartz, cristobalite) and K-feldspar. For the purposes of this study, firstly, standard portland cement concrete specimens and concrete specimens with pyroclastic material from three different places, replacing portland cement by 20%, were prepared. The mineralogical composition of the samples under study and the area where they come from, is as follows: a. Iampolis: analcime + quartz + K-feldspar + albite + Illite/Smectite b. Darmeni : analcime + quartz + K-feldspar + albite + calcite c. Skaloma : smectite + cristobalite + heulandite-2 + mordenite + K-feldspar + quartz The compressive strength of the prepared specimens after periods of 7 and 28 days was measured and the pozzolanic activity of the samples was calculated according to ASTM Standard C618. Following the first test, the pozzolanic activity of a second sample from Iampolis area was more extensively studied. The compressive strength of concrete specimens made of 100% Portland cement of 145 type, and concrete specimens that were prepared by replacing Portland cement in proportions of 10, 20, 30 and 40% was determined. From the results of this study it is concluded that the analcimic tuffs could be a potential source for pozzolanic cement. More extensive study is needed for the estimation of the percentage of the altered pyroclastics that gives the optimum results concerning the cement pozzolanic activity. The optimization of the pozzolanic properties of the altered pyroclastics by calcination may be investigated as well.",,

Barite has fibrous, rosette, and dendritic habits and is hosted in Middle Eocene marine carbonate of the Wadi Shallala Chalk Formation. The barite has an average BaO value of 56 %, and SrO value of 0.40 %. Associated barium-rich limestones have average BaO of 20 % and SrO of 0.22 %. Cr and V are strongly enriched compared to other trace elements, and Sigma REE is low for both the barite and the barium-rich limestone. Chondrite-normalized-REE patterns exhibits LREE enrichment with prominent negative Ce anomalies. For stable isotopes, delta S-34 and delta O-18 range from +24.3 parts per thousand to +28.1 parts per thousand, and +5.22 parts per thousand to +8.75 parts per thousand. Texture, mineral paragenesis, host rock alteration products, relatively high SrO content, high delta S-34, delta O-18 values, and low LREE suggest a hydrothermal origin of the studied barite. These results are comparable to those from hydrothermal barites from Iran in similar host rocks. Structurally, the area is dominated by rift-margin normal faults, which, combined with the presence of impermeable volcanic rocks of the Harrat Ash Shaam Basalt complex, created an upwards moving flow of heated groundwater that mixed with downward-moving seawater along the fault zone. Reaction of oxygen-free hydrothermal fluid carrying Ba and Sr mixing with oxygen-rich seawater carrying SO4 created the deposit. This study proposes that barite deposits formed by the act of hypogene hydrothermal solutions consisting of barium-enriched saline groundwater that percolated through the fractures of Muwaqqar Chalk Marl Formation. These fluids reacted with soft wallrock sediments that are characterised by high organic matter and heavy metals. Ba, along with Cu, Cr, and V and likely Pb and Zn, was dissolved. Sulfur as sulphide may have been transported in these fluids, but the amounts were small based on the highly positive S isotopes in the barite compared to S in the oil shale. Some contribution of magmatic fluid from the adjacent Al Bishriyya volcanic field may have occurred. These basaltic dikes, which are of Pleistocene age, are characterised by a higher concentration of Ba, which reaches 0.14 to 0.19 %, than similar rocks of the basaltic plateau elsewhere in north-eastern Jordan. However, these deposits are basaltic, not a good source of magmatic volatiles, and the oxygen isotopes are too heavy compared to magmatic-sourced water from basalts elsewhere and instead are compatible with barites precipitated from seawater.",,

In addition, at least one species could not be ascribed to a genus. All species in the material are described in open nomenclature, partially due to the imperfect preservation, partially due to the outdated systematics to the scarcity of recent revisions. The dominant group in the material are nepiomorph bivalves, which constitute around 60% of the specimens in the studied material. A high proportion of nepiomorphs in the fauna from Amerboh Group is typical for the Silurian-Devonian deeper shelf bivalve faunas from the Rheic Ocean. The different preservation of epifaunal/ semi-infaunal vs. infaunal species, and the lack of any major signs of mechanical abrasion of the specimens indicate a low-energy, slow sedimentation in a deep water setting, coincident with a sea level rise in the area.

It includes thin-layered marls, clayey marls, calcareous marls, elastic layered limestones, calcarenites and breccias. Those parts of the terrain which can be described as soft rocks according to mechanical means, exposed to the weathering processes and degrading forces reduce the durability within the ''engineering time scale''. However, it is now possible to protect the flysch material from the erosion processes caused by weathering during the design and construction phases. Unfortunately, there are no appropriate methods for reaching conclusions as to which parts of the flysch structure should be protected. The wetting-drying process is considered to be the most important process during weathering. According to the analysis, as the most appropriate due to the mentioned characteristics, the tests are chosen as index properties. Some of these tests are modified in order to adapt them to the determined characteristics of some flysch layers. All these modifications and the new proposed tests are explained in the paper. The correlations between the measured values are used as the basis for the classification of the analyzed soft rock according to its resistance to weathering processes.

These temperate bioclastic carbonates developed around the shelf margin of a graben-generated embayment (Lentini Graben) and volcanic sea-mount topography facing the Catania Plain. Although showing considerable thickness variations within the study area all units are part of a widespread regional development. The lowest unit (principally Santernian) is primarily developed between Scordia and the Catania Plain. The middle unit (Emilian) is most widespread and extends at least from the Caltagirone area in the west to the Agnone area in the east. Finally, the youngest lithified carbonate unit (Middle Pleistocene in age) is developed throughout the NE region from Scordia to Villasmundo. In deeper marginal areas the carbonates pass into detrital, deep water pelagic marls which appear to have been deposited continuously throughout the early Pleistocene. The region was selected for study because of the high rate of post-depositional uplift which have raised the sediments into upland areas, now readily accessible along deep valleys. Cases are presented to demonstrate that: a) the carbonate units have significant regional distributions; b) each unit is tightly constrained in time; c) the overriding sedimentological controls on carbonate production were climatic, with primary carbonate production being confined to warmer, highstand parts of glacially controlled eustatic cycles. Bioclastic carbonates of similar ages have widespread developments throughout, other regions of the Mediterranean. This is the first attempt to accurately document their sedimentological characteristics and tie down their distributions in space and time within a well exposed region. The climatically driven eustatic component controls the timing of carbonate production and makes these successions critical to the correlation of marine and terrestrial Quaternary faunas throughout the Mediterranean. For these reasons each unit is precisely characterized to enable clear comparison with strata beyond the region.",,

A sandy lithofacies, with blocky sandstones, is developed even farther to the southeast (Elbsandsteingebirge). The TIC boundary is situated in the lower part of the Strehlen Formation in the marly lithofacies, known from several boreholes.

The major oxides were; SiO2 (25.22-37.22) wt%, CaO (20.32-33.59) wt%, Al2O3 (5.50-8.31) wt%, Fe2O3 (3.86-6.10) wt%, MgO (2.154.30) wt%, and CO2 (7.42-16.79) wt%, minor oxides were; TiO2 (0.52-0.78) wt%, Na2O (0.37-1.08) wt%, K2O (0.881.16) wt%, P2O, (0.12-0.63) wt%, SO3 (0.23-1.39) wt%, and Cl (0.01-0.05) wt%, Organic matter (OM) was (4.47-17.72) wt%. Heavy elements were; Cr (170-399) ppm, Ni (91-157) ppm, Cu (27-151) ppm, Zn (83-735) ppm, Pb (12-536) ppm, and As (4-10) ppm. The factor analysis sorts three main components representing 78,45 of total variance were (43,84, 27,39, 7,23) for the first, second and third factors, respectively, that reflect the controlling of elements distribution in the mineral groups of the sediments; the group of organic matter and secondary minerals, the clay minerals group, and the iron oxides group. In addition to the carbonate group. The geoaccumulation index (I-geo) indicates that in two industrial areas in Ugab wadi and Al-Yarmouk wadi there were highest concentrations of polluted elements in relation to the rest of wadis, and therefore these sites seemingly had high levels of pollution compared to other sites that appeared to have been moderately polluted.

The exposed succession consists predominantly of competent carbonates, with only minor occurrences of shales and marls. None of these wells penetrated formations older than the oldest exposed at the surface, which are of Liassic age. In the majority, reservoirs were invaded by meteoric waters as a result of the proximity of elevated, outcropping recharge areas, inefficient seals, or the proximity of major faults. Calculations based on gravity data indicate that the basement beneath the Lebanon uplift is some 3 km below sea level, providing for a sedimentary column over 5,000-m thick below the Upper Jurassic, most of which is unknown. The Triassic successions in the adjacent Palmyride Basin of Syria and of northern Jordan are, by contrast, well-known from subsurface exploration and drilling; over 1,500 m of carbonates, with thinner interbeds of shales and evaporites, are present in the former, where a number of Triassic oil, gas and condensate discoveries have been made. The axis of the Palmyride Basin trends WSW, towards Lebanon, as revealed by isopachs; Upper Triassic (Carnian) evaporites, including major salts, have a similar trend. It has long been proposed that if Triassic evaporites extend to Lebanon, they may provide a major impervious seal between meteoric water-invaded reservoir strata above, and potentially petroliferous Triassic and Paleozoic successions below. The recent marine reflection-seismic survey offshore Tripoli (northern Lebanon) has revealed the presence of a deeper and tectonically- mobilised salt level, in the core of a compressional structure, directly on trend with the westwards prolongation of the Palmyride salt and peripheral anhydrite basin on the other side of the Levant (Dead Sea) transform fault (lateral slip here <20 km).

They are interpreted as feeding traces made by large marine vertebrates, most likely plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs searching for food in the lime mud of the shallow Middle Jurassic sea floor. Possible prey animals were infaunal invertebrates (crustaceans) which produced an intricate meshwork of burrows (mainly Rhizo-corallium irregulare and Thalassinoides)in the bottom sediments, as well as infaunal bivalves. Evidence from cololites of predatory pelagic reptiles (ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs) as well as reptile regurgitalites indicate that these animals fed not only on fast-swimming vertebrates and cephalopods but also an epi- and endobenthic invertebrates. In addition, the cololites show that the predators ingested considerable amounts of bottom sediment. Different sizes and shapes of the traces suggest that the gutters were produced by different reptiles or age groups. Candidates for the widest gutters are pliosaurs. Of the marine vertebrates known from Jurassic time, only the snout of adult pliosaurs of the genus Liopleurodon was broad enough to produce gutters more than 40 cm wide. Smaller, less than 15 cm wide gutters, could have been made by presiosauroids or by the narrow pointed snouts of ichthyosaurs. Almost identical traces described from the Oxfordian of Spain and similar but smaller traces from the Lower Devonian of Prague are equally interpreted as feeding traces on the sea floor. Feeding traces of vertebrates in bottom sediments may give detailed information on the hunting behaviour of the predators. However, the attribution of the traces to definite vertebrate taxa remains uncertain.",,

This legacy presents special difficulties for the redeveloper, particularly as the original surface now lies beneath hh contaminated by industrial residues, obscuring any abandoned miner shafts, which are often uncharted. Much of the coal mining was in the 10 m Thick Coal seam and predates 1872, when the deposition of plans became a statutory requirement. Apart from chronic instability from coal and limestone workings, other features that give rise to specific problems stem from mine drainage channels, abandoned subsided canal beds, infilled marl pits and sand workings. Experiences from the recently completed programme of reclamation schemes carried out by the Black Country Development Corporation are reported. Several schemes are described in outline. These demonstrate how, by appropriate preparation, planning, management and selection of reclamation techniques, the problems left as a legacy of mining can be overcome successfully, resulting in some of the most notable 'brownfield' developments in the United Kingdom.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/C8/CC/58/C8CC588265B529D4C450A06C38438610.pdf

It is believed that underlying soil is the main source of radon in the atmosphere of dwellings, offices and public places. In view of the risk presented by high concentrations of radon and its progeny indoors, this work was carried out to measure radon concentration in different types of soil in the northern part of Jordan at different depths (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 cm). The prepared time-integrated passive dosimeters were distributed among eight stations located in the governorate of Irbid. The results of this study show that the radon levels at a given depth vary significantly from one type of soil to another. For example, at 100 cm depth radon levels range from 4000 Bq/m(3) in limestone to 4 x 10(5) Bq/m(3) in chalky marl. Moreover, we found that the radon concentration increases exponentially with depth, which is in good agreement with a mathematical model. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that houses should not be constructed on such soil if U/Th-rich bedrock lies underground.",,

Maggiori'}, {'name': 'Rodney Hensley'}]","Pore pressure and fracture gradient are the two natural limits that exert the greatest influence on drilling costs and safety. Traditional empirical ""pore pressure"" models are limited to one lithology type (shale) and rely on incorporating petrophysical or drilling data vs. depth trend lines. We describe a new method that quantifies the effective-stress law, p = S - sigma(nu). This method uses petrophysical data (gamma ray, resistivity, density) and mineralogic stress/strain relationships to calculate pore pressure and fracture gradient, on a foot-by-foot basis, through all sedimentary rock types. Cretaceous marls and limestones have proven to be an obstacle for traditional pore-pressure evaluation methods. With numbers of high-pressure exploration wells in the North Sea Central graben increasing, there is a need for a better understanding of pressures through the Cretaceous and into the pressured formations below. This effective-stress-law method, which is used to determine pore pressure/fracture gradient, has been tested successfully in the complex limestone/shale and sandstone-shale sequences of the North Sea as an aid to well planning and real-time drilling operations decision making by use of measurement while drilling (MWD) petrophysical data. This method has recently been used successfully on two Central graben wells. BP drilled a high pressure/high temperature (HPHT) well in the second quarter of 1993 and used on-site pore pressure and fracture gradient (PP/FG) calculations, along with other more traditional pore-pressure methods, to help set an intermediate casing string at an optimum depth.

These deposits contain varying amounts of brachiopods, echinoderms, foraminifera (mainly represented by Spirillina, Lenticulina, Usbekistania, Bigenerina Glomospira and Reophax), cephalopods? sponges and associated encrusters, and scarce bivalves, ostracods and gastropods. Fragments of reworked microbialites (tuberoids, Tubiphytes, nubecularians, bryozoans, serpulids, and Terebella), and glauconite also occur in variable quantities. In one section of the proximal shelf area (eastern Swiss Jura) there is interfingering of facies dominated by platform-derived elements (ooids, oncoids, coral fragments, peloids, bivalves, ostracods, gastropods) and of facies related to a more parautochthonous, distal sedimentation (Rhaxella and other sponge-spicules, brachiopods, Lenticulina, Spirillina). The complete record of each ammonite zone as well as the recognition of different ammonite horizons suggest that no important sedimentary gap is present For the deep-shelf deposits of southern Germany, statistical analysis shows that the higher the total percentage of particles is in a sample, the more frequent are glauconite, bioturbation, nodularization, cephalopods, sponges, and microbial crusts. Wackestone and packstone samples thus generally correspond to lower sedimentation rates than mudstones that reflect a high carbonate-mud sedimentation rate. The carbonate mud is thought to be exported from the shallow platform because scarce nannofossils and/or insignificant bioerosion in sponge reefs exclude the possibility of relating carbonate-mud variations to changes in autochthonous productivity. Variation in carbonate-mud exportation from the platform towards the deep shelf has thus been implied from the relative abundance of particulate elements (fauna, tuberoids) which are considered as mainly autochthonous or parautochthonous. Consequently, changes in carbonate mud content in the studied deep-shelf settings may be related to carbonate production on the shallow platform and to the export dynamics from the platform to deeper sedimentary environments. Variation in carbonate sedimentation rate has been used to interpret depositional sequences in terms of sequence stratigraphy and cyclostratigraphy: constrained by a detailed bio- and chronostratigraphical framework, a correlation of these sequences is proposed between the sections in southern Germany and the eastern Swiss Jura.",,

All of the ammonite biozones are present ranging from the Lower Hettangian up to the Lower Sinemurian. Several environments follow one another in an offshore situation in which the hydrodynamic control on sedimentation is related to periodic storms. The fossil assemblages indicate deposition within the infra- to circa-littoral zones. Benthic communities lived mainly on soft to firmgrounds in poorly agitated euhaline waters, periodically depleted in oxygen at the sediment-water interface. 2. The instability may be partly explained by the paleogeographical situation of the study area within the Paris Basin. The area of deposition was located near the source of terrigenous sediments and sheltered from the influences of the open Tethys by a topographic high in the South. 3.

This influx began just before diatomite deposition in the Paleo-Mediterranean, continued during a decrease in species diversity in coral reef formation, and diminished with the initial stages of ""brine"" concentration in the deep-water phase of the Crisis. The influx is most readily studied in a condensed section of marl in the Bou Regreg valley near Rabat. The beginning of this ""siphon event"" coincides with the Tortonian/Messinian boundary (6.4 Ma, subchron 6N1). It is identified by (1) a change in the planktonic foraminifera from dominance of warm, tropical, epipelagic Globorotalia menardii with Globigerinoides to the temperate, mesopelagic Gl. miotumida plexus with conomiozea; (2) the sudden appearance of an upper psychrospheric ostracode fauna with Agrenocythere pliocenica and Oblitacythereis ruggierii, (3) a change in nannoflora; and (4) beginning of the 6.3 Ma Global Carbon Shift. The initial strong influx stage of the siphon lasted at least 0.7 m.y., decreasing after the middle of Chron 5, ca. 5.7, to be lost ca. 5.3 Ma. Conditions for the siphon formed when the continental climate created a deficit in the water budget of the Paleo-Mediterranean Sea. The reversal took place when tectonic movement in the foredeeps of the Betic- Rif Orogene changed the thresholds of the twin straits, the Rifian Corridor and the Iberian Portal. Inflow increased rapidly in the southern Corridor to draw in waters from beneath the rising Atlantic pycnocline, while Paleo-Mediterranean Overflow Water (PMOW) continued out of the northern Iberian Portal. The invasion of ""nappes"" or olistoliths, first into the portal and then into the corridor, led to the end of the outflow of the PMOW terminating the need for the siphon, and then to the isolation of the Paleo-Mediterranean.",,
5f0dd3189fced0a24b0cb826,Early Pleistocene Hominins Outside of Africa : Recent Excavations,,[{'name': 'Bizat  Ruhama'}],"The earliest evidence of hominin presence outside of Africa is scarce. Although it is clear that hominins reached Eurasia at the beginning of the Early Pleistocene, equipped with an Oldowan-like tool-kit, the Eurasian Early Pleistocene archaeological record is actually limited to a few occurrences, many of which are not in primary archaeological context. Consequently, much of the paleoecological and behavioral aspects of the earliest occupation of Eurasia remain poorly understood. Here we report on the renewed excavations at the Early Pleistocene core-and-flake site of Bizat Ruhama, Israel, located on the southern coastal plain of the southern Levant. The site yielded several lithic and faunal assemblages in primary anthropogenic context and is dated to the Matuyama paleomagnetic chron (1.96–0.78 Ma), based on paleomagnetic and faunal evidence. The results of the current study at Bizat Ruhama reveal a spatially extensive single-horizon open-air occurrence with indications for fast burial and good preservation of the original site features. The Bizat Ruhama industry shows no Acheulian affinities and exhibits technological simplicity. However, it demonstrates the hominin ability to adapt to unfavorable raw material conditions. Technological simplicity and absence of bifacial and discoidal knapping suggest that the site represents Mode 1 dispersal out of Africa. The faunal assemblage of the site was accumulated primarily by anthropogenic agents, preserving signs of hominin butchery. Geological and faunal evidence indicate open homogeneous semi-arid environment with no evidence for river or lake in the immediate surroundings, thereby broadening our knowledge of the range of habitats exploited by early hominins and their adaptive skills. Altogether, the results point to short-term hominin occupation and suggest that animal carcasses were processed in place, along with knapping activities. INTRODUCTION E Pleistocene hominin sites in Eurasia are scarce, but their importance for studying the first dispersals out of Africa, and for illustrating early hominin adaptations and life ways, is immense. Currently, the evidence for the earliest hominin presence in Eurasia derives from Dmanisi in Georgia, dated to 1.78 Ma (Ferring et al. 2008; Gabunia et al. 2000) and the lowest level of Majuangou in the Nihewan basin, China, dated to 1.66 Ma (Zhu et al. 2004). Both occurrences yielded simple core-and-flake assemblages comparable with East African Mode 1 assemblages (de Lumley et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2004). Given that the age of the earliest known Acheulian sites in Africa is 1.65–1.5 Ma (Asfaw et al. 1992; Roche et al. 2003; Semaw et al. 2008), it seems that the earliest out-of-Africa sorties took place before the emergence of the Acheulian lithic technology. Although the interpretation of the timing of the earliest out-of-Africa dispersal and the technological affinities of the earliest migrants seem to be quite compelling, the Eurasian Early Pleistocene record de facto is extremely sparse. Large numbers of Early Pleistocene artifacts in primary depositional context were reported only from Dmanisi in Georgia and ‘Ubeidiya in Israel (Bar-Yosef and Goren-Inbar 1993; Bar-Yosef and Tchernov 1972; de Lumley et al. 2005; Gabunia and Vekua 1995; Gabunia et al. 2000). In other Early Pleistocene occurrences either the number of artifacts, or the size of the excavated areas are very small, or the context of the artifacts is questionable (Arzarello et al. 2006; Carbonell et al. 1999, 2008; Chauhan 2009; Dennell 2009 and references therein; Derevianko 2009; Oms et al. 2000; Santonja and Villa 2006).

LOCATION AND GEOLOGY Bizat Ruhama is located at the fringe of the Negev Coastal Plain, 25km east of the present Mediterranean shoreline (Figure 1). The site is situated in a transition zone between the Mediterranean and the arid climatic belts in Irano-Turanian phytogeographical region with the average yearly rainfall of 300–400mm. The geographic position in the desert fringe makes the area highly sensitive to environmental changes deriving from fluctuations of climatic belts during the Quaternary (Horowitz 1979; Magaritz 1986; Magaritz and Goodfriend 1987; Vaks et al. 2006, 2007). The area is characterized by low undulating topography (Figure 2). Low sand and loess hills (160–190masl) descend gently to the east and the north toward Nahal Shiqma, the largest stream in the region. The loess hills are occasionally disturbed by erosion that creates typical badpaleoecology and behavior very limited. As a result, the conditions that allowed the earliest dispersals, the range of Eurasian habitats exploited by early hominins, as well as behavioral adaptations and technological skills of the earliest Eurasians, remain poorly understood. Here we report on the renewed excavations at the Early Pleistocene site of Bizat Ruhama, Northern Negev, Israel, located on the southern coastal plain of the southern Levant. Bizat Ruhama is an open-air single-horizon site that yielded several lithic and faunal assemblages in primary anthropogenic context. The site was first excavated in 1996 and is known for its unique (in the Levant) Lower Paleolithic industry, characterized by the absence of bifaces and the small size of the artifacts (Ronen et al. 1998; Zaidner et al. 2003). Renewal of excavations in 2004–05 was directed toward two major goals—first, to determine whether the lithic industry best fits within the Mode 1 or Acheulian techno-complexes; and, second, to study the hominin paleoecology at the site. In this paper we discuss the general aspects of the site including geology, site description, site formation processes, and distribution of the finds, and summarize some of the Figure 1. The location of Biszat Ruhama. 164 • PaleoAnthropology 2010 composed of a littoral facies of the Pliocene sea transgression and includes sandstones, conglomerates cemented by calcareous sand, beachrock and, to a lesser extent, un-cemented sands and marls. Ahuzam is a fluvial formation deposited along rivers that followed the regressing Pliocene sea. Both formations contributed the only available lithic raw material source in the area. land landscape in which the site of Bizat Ruhama is situated (Figure 3). The base of the Quaternary sequence in the area is the Pliocene Pleshet and Ahuzam formations (Figure 4; Bar-Yosef 1964; Gvirtzman 1990; Gvirtzman and Buchbinder 1969; Horowitz 1979; Issar 1961; Sneh and Buchbinder 1984; Sneh et al. 1998; Zilberman 1984, 1986). The Pleshet Formation is Figure 2. Undulating loess hills in the Bizat Ruhama area. Figure 3. Bizat Ruhama badland field. Early Pleistocene Site of Bizat Ruhama, Israel • 165 Bizat Ruhama (Bar-Yosef 1964; Sneh and Buchbinder 1984). Their thickness reaches 30m and they directly overlie the Ahuzam Formation. The sandstone is exposed only in a few locations west of Bizat Ruhama, where it is known as the Hirbet Harev kurkar ridge (Bar-Yosef 1964; Horowitz 1979; Issar 1961; Nir and Bar-Yosef 1976; Nir 1989). The sandstone is overlain by hamra that constitutes the surface on which the Bizat Ruhama archaeological remains are located (see Figure 4). The desert influence in the region is evident in the deposition of Peri-Saharan loess accumulating from the Middle Pleistocene to the present. The thickness of the loess During the Early and Middle Pleistocene, the Negev Coastal Plain was influenced by sea level fluctuations, the vicinity of the desert, and pedogenic processes. The major parent material of the sediments that cover the coastal plain is quartzitic sand swept from the Nile Delta along the eastern Mediterranean shoreline. The sands were transported eastward from the current coast during numerous sea transgressions that took place during the Quaternary. Western winds typical to the Israeli coastal plain drew the sands further inland. Sands often were transformed either into sandstone (locally known as kurkar) or red sandy loam (hamra). Sandstones appear in almost all boreholes around Figure 4. Bizat Ruhama composite stratigraphic section and microstratigraphy of the excavated areas. Composite stratigraphical chart is based on the study of the Bizat Ruhama type-section (Strata 1-5; Ronen et al. 1998, Laukhin et al. 2001; Mallol et al. submitted) and on Bar-Yosef (1964). 166 • PaleoAnthropology 2010 badland field (see Figure 1) was conducted by Dassa (2002), Ron and Gvirtzman (2001), and Wieder et al.

Of the 107 taxa of vascular plants recorded during surveys conducted in 1994-96 only five were non-native, and those five were found predominantly in the riparian forest which bordered the fen proper. Significant populations of eight state-listed species were present (Carex tenera, Carex trichocarpa, Filipendula rubra, Gentiana procera, Parnassia glauca, Potentilla fruticosa, Sanguisorba canadensis, and Solidago ohioensis) as well as populations of the rare spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) and the Baltimore checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas phaeton). A narrow band of riparian forest bordering a stream divides Betsch fen into two fen areas. The northern fen was covered by sedge meadow in which Carex stricta was the dominant. In contrast, the southern fen included areas of open marl flat typified by Juncus brachycephalus, Rhynchospora capillacea, and Scirpus acutus, sedge meadow, shrub meadow dominated by Salix exigua and various fen indicator herbs, and distinct, monospecific patches of Acorus calamus. Ground water alkalinity varied among community types with areas dominated by Acorus calamus having the greatest alkalinity and the bordering forest the lowest. Analysis of a 56 year record of aerial photos indicates that the northern fen has been stable in size whereas the southern fen has expanded since the site was acquired by The Nature Conservancy. The information presented here supplies a baseline for monitoring the efficacy of the management efforts on-going in this unique remnant.",,

These provided an excellent starting-point for more detailed analysis aimed at drawing up quantitative hydrogeological models and understanding the hydrodynamics of the structures. An essential condition for specific quantitative analysis is a knowledge of the structural geologic setting, not only on a regional scale, but also for each structure. The absence of experimental verifications on the geology of depth or their different interpretation is evident in the difficulty of correctly locating the limits of the hydrostructures. The difficulties of locating the limits of hvdrostructures correctly stem from either lack of experimental proof of the geology at depth or the possibility of alternative interpretations. These limitations can be overcome through geologic-structural verification in specific zones and through experimental measurements. The well-known hydrogeological studies of the Majella Mountain considered single sources for water supply (MANFREDINI, 1989). The main studies on a regional scale are those by CELICO (1978) and BONI et alii (1986). No systematic study of the whole structure has yet been attempted, aimed at understanding its subterranean circulation and the relationships between the various outflows. Moreover, no systematic data are available on the discharges or the hydrodynamic, hydrochemical and hydrologic parameters. This work describes the hydrogeology of the Majella Mountain, the most external carbonate unit outcropping in the Central Apennines, particularly in terms of its stratigraphic and tectonic setting (CRESCENTI et alii, 1969; CATENACCI, 1974; DONZELLI, 1998; VEZZANI & GHISETTI, 1998), which significantly affect the subterranean water circulation. Studies were made of the hydrodynamics of the recharge basins, recharge modalities through the unsaturated zone, stored water volumes, discharge and temperature hydrographs in relation to rainfall and snow melting, the variability of water chemistry, and groundwater quality. Monthly measurements of discharge, temperature, electrical conductivity and the main chemical parameters were carried out on all the basal springs and on the springs of some perched aquifers. The basal springs were also monitored continuously in order to record the chemical-physical parameters. The structure of the Majella (plate 2) is hydraulically isolated on the surface on all sides, while in depth it is limited on three fronts (E, S and W). The northernmost front of the structure extends below the Mio-Pleistocene terrigenous units of the Pescara valley (fig. 3), and does not exclude its hydraulic continuity in this direction. Analysis of the lithofacies, hydrogeological balance and river discharges of the northern streams has made it possible to locate a new northwestern hydraulic limit, corresponding to a marly member of a terrigenous, mostly calcarenitic formation. Within the Majella structure the following hydrogeological complexes can be recognized (plate 1 and 2): A) a hydrogeological complex of Jurassic-Paleocene limestone characterized by high permeability due to karst and fissuring; B) an aquiclude of the Bolognano Formation consisting of marly limestone and marlstone; C) a hydrogeological complex of calcarenites of the Bolognano Formation characterized by variable permeability, decreasing northward, caused by fracturing and porosity; D) an aquiclude of terrigenous and evaporitic formations consisting of clay, marl and marly clay; E) a hydrogeological complex of highly permeable continental detritus. The recharge of the Majella hydrostucture takes place exclusively by precipitation, without any water yield from the adjacent structures, Recharge of the basal aquifer is due to melting snows and subordinately to rainfall.

The development of the karst network in a vadose context was favoured by an episode of fracturing (N-S to NW-SE fractures) that affected the Cenomanian platform carbonates of the Natih Formation. The karstic filling comprises two main types of speleothems: - laminated bioclastic calcarenites with graded bedding essentially deposited by gravity currents in a vadose regime; - crystallisation of large masses of white calcite in a saturated regime. The calcite was deposited during several episodes, and often constitutes most of the filling. The episode of uplift and emergence, accompanied by fracturing which favoured the development of the Madar karstic system, was probably induced by the swelling of the Arabian platform, in response to the initiation of the ophiolitic nappe obduction. Karstic filling probably occurred during the rise of marine level, what is suggested by mixing of vadose and marine influences (production of bioclastic calcarenites and later dolomitisation of these ones; crystallisation of white calcite of various origins as evidenced by cathodoluminescence data and carbonate isotopes). At the beginning of the Senonian, the Jabal Madar area was again submerged and incorporated in a relatively deep foreland basin where pelagic marls and turbidites were deposited (Muti Formation). The Jabal Madar (and its karstic system) and the whole of the Adam foothills were affected by folding towards the end of the Cretaceous, during the final phase of thrusting of the Omani nappes. The folding was strongly reactivated by post-obduction compressional movement which occurred during Miocene times.",,

Ferrigno'}]","Among sedimentary rocks, turbiditic sandstones are very common within orogenic belts, especially those with low relief composed mostly of sedimentary tectonic units; in this respect the Northern Apennines belt is a typical example. The mechanical behaviour of these rocks is extremely variable, depending on the degree and character of the diagenesis, which in turn depends on interactions between different factors such as the tectonic setting, the degree and rate of burial, the textural characters and composition of sediments. The relations between depositional facies, detrital composition, diagenesis, and mechanical behaviour are considered for the case of turbidite sandstones of the Ranzano Formation (Eocene-Oligocene), which crops out in the eastern Piedmont Tertiary Basin (BTP). Understanding these relationships is also important because of the extensive use of these rocks for buildings forming the cultural heritage of Northern Apennine and western Po Plain villages and towns. Samples collected from three different members (Pizzo d'Oca, Val Pessola and S. Sebastiano Curone Members) of the Ranzano Formation, having strongly contrasting petrofacies and extremely variable depositional facies grading from conglomerates to mudstones, were analysed in order to check their relations with diagenetic characters in a quite small area, having an homogeneous diagenetic regime. The data show that the relative amount of interstitial components (cements and pores), does not seem to be correlated with the framework composition (petrofacies), and also show no correlation between the occurrence of authigenic versus detrital carbonates. In contrast, there is a clear correlation of the amount of pores and cements with depositional facies. In turn, the incidence of the authigenic minerals and, in particular, their abundance relative to the volume of residual intergranular pores, seems to be fundamental in determining the resistance of the rocks to compression. As a result, depositional facies, rather than framework composition, seem to determine the diagenetic evolution of turbiditic arenites. It suggests that thin arenitic intervals interbedded with marls in thin-bedded arenaceous-pelitic facies, worked as conduits for carbonate-rich fluids expelled from the adjacent marly sediments during compaction, allowing calcitic cements to precipitate. Conversely, in thick massive sandstone beds amalgamated in tens of meter thick bodies, fluid circulation had been less intensive, with consequently reduced precipitation of authigenic carbonates.",,

In recent years, the gradual deformation approach has been developed and successfully applied to several simple (synthetic or pseudo-real) cases. This paper presents the application of the gradual deformation method for history matching to a real oil field located offshore Brazil. The oil reservoir consists of turbiditic sandstones interbedded by shales and marls. The data set includes 47 wells with lithofacies description and 15 years production history. A fine scale geostatistical lithofacies model was built using the non-stationary truncated Gaussian approach. The model is conditioned to the lithofacies data at wells and takes into account the non-stationary distribution of the lithofacies. The sensitivity of the dynamic behavior with respect to the model realizations was studied. Preliminary results of using gradual deformation method for improving history matching are presented. Introduction Constraining stochastic reservoir models to production data has been an active research domain for many years. Several methods have been developed, but they are in general too expensive to be applied in complex real cases. This paper outlines a methodology from geological modeling to history matching. This methodology has two main features: the non-stationary truncated Gaussian simulation method1,2 or building reservoir lithofacies model and the regionalized gradual deformation method3,4,5 for history matching. This methodology was applied to a complex real case of a turbiditic reservoir located offshore Brazil. The reservoir is submitted to water-flood and the heterogeneities play an important role in the fluid displacement. Our objective was to build reservoir lithofacies models constrained to water rate in the production wells. The paper is organized as follows. We begin by presenting the general information about the PBR field. This is followed by a description of the reservoir lithofacies model constructed by the non-stationary truncated Gaussian method. Before going into flow simulation and history matching, we present the procedure for the determination of the petrophysical properties of each lithifacies, the method used for upscaling and the criteria (objective functions) for history matching. The section patchwork presents the results of a first tentative to improve the history matching by the combination of different sub-models. Finally, preliminary results on further improving the patchwork model by regionalized gradual deformation method are presented. General description of the PBR field The PBR field, located offshore Brazil, has been producing since June 1979 and the water injection began in April 1984. The field has 34 oil production wells and 12 water injection wells (Figure 1). In 1987 the total oil rate reached the maximal value of about 10000 m3/day. The water breakthrough was observed in October 1985 and the field water-cut went up to 40% in 1995. The PBR field consists of massive turbiditic sandstone interbedded by clays and marls. The sandstone is very permeable and the intercalations, with very weak permeabilities, play a very important role on the fluid movement in the reservoir. Johann et al.6,7 identified 8 sedimentary facies from log information, petrophysical analysis and core description. They distinguished three stratigraphic units in the PBR field from log correlations between wells, supervised by seismic data. Limits between the units are erosion surfaces. In considering the sedimentary environment, the top of the reservoir was chosen to be the reference surface for the geostatistical modeling of the three units.

It is one of three New Zealand K-T sections with a well-delineated ""fireball"" layer containing anomalous iridium, soot particles, and fullerenes, and it contains a highly fossiliferous latest Cretaceous marl unit, not seen in other sections, immediately underlying the K-T boundary clay. The c. 50 m thick Flaxbourne section is the only New Zealand locality known with an essentially complete sequence of earliest Paleocene foraminiferal zones. These include (K-T boundary is zero datum): Guembelitria cretacea Zone (P0), 0.0-0.07 m; Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina Zone (P?), 0.07-0.24 m; P. eugubina-Subbotina triloculinoides Subzone (P1a), 0.24-0.40 m; S. triloculinoides- Globanomalina compressa/Praemurica inconstans Subzone (P1b), 0.40-0.50 m; and Globanomalina compressa/Praemurica inconstans-Praemurica uncinata Subzone (Plc), 0.50-11.5 m. Strata from 11.5 m to the highest exposed beds at c. 38 m are classified as undifferentiated Paleocene. Cretaceous planktic ""survivor taxa"" occur up to 0.40 m but are replaced rapidly above Zone P0 by Paleocene taxa. Latest Cretaceous strata are dominated by Heterohelix/ Globigerinelloides planktic foraminiferal assemblages, associated with sparse (typically <5%), mainly epifaunal benthic taxa and rare radiolarians. Commencing abruptly at the base of the boundary clay, maximum size of planktic and benthic specimens decreases sharply, while abundance of both radiolarian and benthic foraminifera increase about tenfold relative to planktics, features which typify the basal 0.4 m of Paleocene strata. Heterohelix/Hedbergella associations characterise planktic assemblages initially, but give way to Eoglobigerina /Chiloguembelina planktic assemblages. Epifaunal taxa dominate benthic faunas, but infaunal forms show minor abundance peaks. Benthic abundance remains near 45% up through c. 0.3 m but then declines sharply to c. 25% at 0.40 m (highest detailed sample). Stratigraphically higher samples were studied in less detail. From 0.5 to 11.5 m they contain poor foraminiferal assemblages similar to those described above, but these are then replaced by planktic-poor (<5% planktics) assemblages with normal-sized benthic taxa, including Gavelinella beccariiformis and Nuttallides cretatruempyi, which occur to the top of the exposed section.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/EA/14/FF/EA14FF4F6D50F6FBA137A12205CF35D7.pdf

The faunas, especially ammonites, allow increasingly precise age estimations and correlations referred to the biochronological standard for Submediterranean Europe. The faunas show a submediterranean character in open marine environments and the South Tethyan situation is attested by abundant Emileia and Oraniceras in lower Dogger as well as the lack of boreal and sub-boreal families all along Jurassic. In fact, the Jurassic of Central Tunisia corresponds to five major transgressive-regressive tectono-eustatic second order cycles, four of which are separated by three sub-marine unconformities associated with important hiatuses. The abrupt facies changes and the frequency of condensed sections and/or hiatuses resulted from the interaction between global sea level fluctuations and local to regional tectonic activities associated with Early Mesozoic Tethyan rifting. Central Tunisia (North-South Axis) corresponded during the Jurassic to an uplifted mega-block acting as a carbonate outer shelf relayed to the north and to the south by subsident basins. Due to the intense activities of deep marine currents, occurring especially during the major rises or falls of sea level, this carbonate outer shelf has acted as a sediment-starved high. This latter has been maintained far from coarse or abundant elastic influences. Sedimentation has been recorded only during aggradational-retrogradational highstand phases.",,

It is based on four stratigraphic sections: the Lompret quarry, the Frasnes railway section, the Leus quarry and southern parts of the Lion quarry. The Lompret section is here described for the first time and represents the main focus of this work. The Bieumont Member consists of a bedded sequence of argillaceous and bioclastic limestone. At Lompret, the Member is exposed with a thickness of 48 m (the basal contact is not exposed). The Member consists of 6 lithological units (in stratigraphic order): 1. argillaceous limestone with episodic intercalations of reef debris (distal reef talus), 2. an alternation of marl and argillaceous limestone (basinal background sediment), 3. thickly-bedded bioclastic limestone (channel deposits), 4. a sequence of argillaceous limestone (inter-channel deposits), 5. bioclastic limestone with sporadic occurrence of framestone (proximal fore-reef deposits) and 6. fine-grained, bioclastic limestone interbedded with prominent layers of reef debris (distal fore-reef deposits). Within unit 5, an isolated reef block transported down the paleoslope is present. Microfacies analysis revealed 16 microfacies units which together with the lithological subdivisions were used to reconstruct the dynamic sedimentary history of the Bieumont Member at Lompret. There are two orders of depositional rhythmicity. The reef growth cycle starts with the first significant influx of reef-related facies at the beginning of unit 3 and from thereon is well differentiated from the Bieumont Member stratotype which largely consists of lithologies equivalent to units 1 and 2. Progradation was directed to the South and related shallowing-upward conditions culminated during the deposition of unit 5. On a lower scale, rhythmic bedding within units 2 and 4 could be related to orbitally forced cycling. The vertical and lateral variations of facies within the Bieumont Member were used to reconstruct a depositional model for the Lompret area. In addition, the documentation of facies variation on a regional scale was enhanced by using data from the Focant borehole and geological surveys of Han-sur-Lesse and Barvaux regions.",,

Geochemical and microfossil analyses on a series of short cores provided a detailed record of human impact since European settlement. Early post-settlement sediments consisted of clastic materials rich in Mg, Al, Fe, P and associated metals. An abrupt increase in marl deposition occurred about 1940, perhaps in response to diversion of inflowing water for irrigation and/or an increase in algal productivity. Mo analyses provided a record of increasing hypolimnetic anoxia with eutrophication. Hg concentrations were highest in sediments deposited during the past decade. Microfossil analyses (chironomids, diatoms, chrysophytes) depicted the lake's progressive eutrophication, and the disappearance of the profundal bottom fauna. Water quality improvements have been reported since 1975, but benthic invertebrate communities have recovered only slightly. The diatoms may indicate a modest water quality improvement over the last 20 years. Wood Lake was formerly an oligo-mesotrophic lake with a well-developed profundal fauna. Appropriate mitigative programmes could substantially improve water quality, perhaps allowing re-establishment of the natural oligo-mesotrophic condition.",,

Reservoir production data will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different acidizing techniques and systems used to treat the Point Arguello field. Basic acidizing physics will be covered to help explain the decision making process used to develop acid systems for the Point Arguello field. Acid systems will be tied back to their delivery method; coiled tubing, bull heading, foam diversion and perf washing to determine overall effectiveness of the matrix treatment. Introduction The Point Arguello field is located north of Point Conception on the southern edge of the Santa Maria Offshore Basin (Figure 1). The Monterey Formation and its complex lithology makes up the producing horizon for the Point Arguello field. Unlike the Santa Maria Basin, which started forming inthe early Miocene, the Point Arguello anticline developed during the lateMiocene and continued to grow until the late Pliocene. The Monterey Formation contains a large amount of hydrocarbon deposits. Diatoms make up the majority of the deposits within the Monterey. Over time Diatoms have a diagenetic tendency to dissolve and to precipitate as a fine grain cementatious material. As the cementious material is reburied at deeperh otter depths it will transform to a much harder chert and porcelanite. Thebrittle chert is easily fractured, which constitutes the large horizontal andvertical fracture systems found within the Monterey. Though the Monterey can bethought of as a diatomite, diatomaceous shale/mudstone, chert (opaline silica)and dolomitic, it is comprised of many layers that are generally less than 0.5m thick, which can include marl, chalk, limestone and dolostone. Acidizing Physics There are two main types of acidizing Carbonate and Sandstone. Carbonate acidizing is used to dissolve calcite (calcium carbonate, CaCO 3)and dolomite (MgCO3). Carbonate rocks are classified by their calcite:dolomite ratio, those with a higher than 50% ratio are typically called limestone. Sandstone acidizing is used to dissolve the damage within the pore spaces of the matrix. Sandstone acidizing is descriptive to a reservoir with high quartz silica content. Along with the quartz content the formation may include alumino silicates, metal oxides, sulfates, chlorides, carbonates, and siliceous material. It is important to consider damage mechanism as well as rock type when designing a matrix treatment, as Carbonate and Sandstone treatments affect the reservoir differently. Calcium carbonate reacts with HCL to produce calcium chloride, water and carbon dioxide, while dolomite reacts with HCL to produce calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, water and carbon dioxide. The reaction rate for calcium carbonate is rapid and is transport limited, while the reaction with dolomiteis slower and is reaction rate limited and diffusion rate limited at higher temperatures (Lund 1). The reaction rate becomes important when considering the placement technique and worm holing effect. The typical reaction for calcite can be written as CaCO 3 + 2HCL? CaCl2 + H 2O + CO2 while the reaction for dolomite becomes CaMg(CO3)2 + 4HCL ? CaCl2 +MgCl 2 + 2H2O + 2CO2 Worm holing is the effect of HCL creating microscopic channels within the rock during the reaction process. It has been shown that the acid injection rate can affect the geometry of the wormholes formed, (Daccord 2). In general larger pore spaces create larger longer wormholes. As injection rate increases branching occurs and a dense network of thinner channels are formed.",,

Approximately 2,600 hectares of river banks and agricultural land were affected by tailings deposition and an additional 2,000 hectares were affected by tailings water. Apirsa closed the breach in the dam within one day and within a week commenced tailings removal. Responsibility for the clean-up was divided between Apirsa and the Spanish authorities. By the end of November 1998, Apirsa had completed the clean-up in its sector, an area containing 80% of the discharged tailings. A consultant engaged by Apirsa, Eptisa, concluded that the failure occurred as a result of a 60 metre lateral displacement along a bedding plane in a blue marl clay formation some 14 metres below the dam. Another Apirsa consultant, Principia-EQE, concluded that several deficiencies in the work carried out by the designers of the dam in 1978 and by the independent consultants who studied the stability of the dam in 1996 contributed to the failure. In responding to the accident, Apirsa positioned itself as part of the solution, taking an open and proactive posture in its dealings with the media, the general public and the Spanish authorities. Apirsa built support for its environmental assessment and remediation activities by subjecting its plans to external scientific peer review and applying principles of continuous improvement to their implementation. Apirsa's response to the accident can usefully serve as a model for others faced with adverse circumstances of the magnitude of the failure of the Aznalcollar tailings dam.",,

Haggerty'}]","Site 840 was drilled in 754.4 m of water during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 135 to provide a better understanding of the geologic history of the Tonga forearc during the Late Cenozoic and to permit investigation of the nature and age of the regional unconformity known as Horizon ""A"". The cores recovered are the only ones that have been drilled in the marine environment on the southern Tonga Platform. Detailed study of these cores, combined with interpretation of sedimentary structures from Formation MicroScanner (FMS) images indicate two tectonic events of uplift and rotation of the Tonga Platform. Sedimentologic evidence of a significant seismic reflector interpreted as Horizon ""A"" was recognized at 500 m below seafloor (mbsf) in the Site 840 cores. This corresponds to an age of 6.3 Ma for this event of uplift of the outer forearc and westward tilting of the Tonga Platform. The second tectonic event identified by this study, at 5.1 Ma, is marked by significant changes in the sedimentation rate, lithology, sedimentary structures and carbonate content of the sediments and by changes in the preservation and abundance of foraminifers. The sediments below 260 mbsf are dominated by late Miocene volcaniclastic turbidites interbedded with thin intervals of heavily bioturbated pelagic marlstones. These sediments were deposited on an east-dipping forearc slope, at or near the foraminiferal lysocline, estimated to be not less than 2000 m during the late Miocene. Significant uplift of the outer forearc and consequent northwest tilting of the southern Tonga Platform occurred at approximately 5.1 Ma. At this time, the southern Tonga Platform assumed its present configuration and shallow bathymetry. Sediments younger than 5.1 Ma accumulated on this shallow-water platform in water depths similar to those found there today. INTRODUCTION Site 840 was one of two Tonga forearc sites drilled on ODP Leg 135. It lies in 754.4 m of water and is located approximately 45 km east-northeast of 'Ata Island and about 130 km south-southwest of the islands of Tongatapu and 'Eua (Fig. 1). The site is located in a region informally known as the south central Tonga Platform that forms the crest of the Tonga Ridge south of 21°S. The Tonga Ridge is defined by the 1000-m isobath and extends for more than 1400 km. It is a broad, flat-lying, north-northeast-trending feature between the west-dipping Tonga Trench subduction zone to the east and the active Tofua Arc to the west. Site 840 was intended to provide information on the sedimentologic and tectonic history of the Tonga arc and forearc throughout the Middle and Late Cenozoic. Specifically, the recovered sediments were intended to document the uplift and subsidence history of the forearc since the Middle Cenozoic. The regional, locally angular unconformity known as Horizon ""A"" (Herzer and Exon, 1985) was a drilling objective. This feature was identified and mapped based on single and multichannel seismic surveys (Fig. 2) and was estimated to lie between 450 and 500 mbsf at Site 840 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1992). This unconformity was reasoned to reflect a tectonic event coincident with the initiation of rifting and opening of the Lau (backarc) Basin (Parson, Hawkins, Allan, et al., 1992). It was anticipated that recovery of this interval would permit an investigation of the nature and age of the tectonic event. One of the significant aspects of the drilling and logging of Site 840 was the unexpected predominance of resedimented material. Before Leg 135, it was anticipated that the rocks and sediments recovered would be shallow-water platform carbonates, possibly even reefal material, interbedded with some volcaniclastics (Parson, Hawkins, Allan, et al., 1992). However, the strata recovered are predominantly gravity flow deposits in the form of volcaniclastic turbidites and debris flows. These are interbedded with thin intervals of pelagic or hemipela1 Hawkins, J., Parson, L., Allan, J., et al, 1994. Proc. ODP, Sci. Results, 135: College Station, TX (Ocean Drilling Program). 2 Department of Geosciences, University of Tulsa, 600 South College, Tulsa, OK 74104, U.S.A. gic marlstones. No evidence of a shallow-water carbonate platform at or near Site 840 was recovered. Strata recovered at Site 840 record the evolution of the Tonga forearc since the late Miocene. In this chapter we present a description of the autochthonous and allochthonous sediments recovered from this site. Our discussion includes an interpretation of the probable depositional environment of these sediments, an evaluation of the tectonic implications of the turbidites, an estimation of the probable paleowater depth, and an assessment of the age and significance of Horizon ""A"" at this location. METHODS Forty thin-sections from various lithologies were prepared and examined. Samples from the most carbonate-rich pelagic and hemipelagic marls, particularly those containing biogenic structures, received special attention. All samples were mounted with an ultraviolet-cure epoxy so that the process could be conducted without heating the samples. This was done to preserve the natural fluorescence of the sediments, particularly the biogenic carbonate fraction. Because carbonate material is more prone to fluoresce than volcaniclastic material, ultraviolet and blue-violet epifluorescent microscopy was used in conjunction with standard petrography to resolve the presence and relative degree of preservation of biogenic carbonate grains (Dravis and Yurewica, 1985). This technique also proved helpful in revealing biogenic structures in thin-section because of the concentration of pelagic carbonate material in infilled burrows. Eighty smear slides were prepared to compare the abundance and preservation of biogenic carbonate grains (microfossils) from within infilled burrows to those within the host sediment. Because overall core recovery from Site 840 was only 40% (Table 1), Formation MicroScanner (FMS) logging data were used to complement the study of primary sedimentary and biogenic structures in the forearc deposits. These images can be used to resolve individual turbidite units because of the variation in resistivity from the base to the top of the interval (McLeod, this volume). Processed data from FMS logs acquired from Hole 840B were reformatted for use on a Sun workstation. Schlumberger FMS Image Examiner software was used to identify individual turbidites. Color",,

5f0eba0b9fced0a24b462778,Mesozoic Metamorphic evolution of the Tauern Window,,[{'name': 'V.  Hoeck'}],"The oldest rocks in the Tauern Window are found in a volcano-sedimentary sequence comprising ophiolites, island arc volcanics and associated sediments of Late Proterozoic to Paleozic age (Habach Formation). A part of this sequence underwent pre-Mesozoic metamorphism, partly migmatisation and was intruded by Variscan granitoids. The Postvariscan sequences start with Permotriassic quarzites, middle Triassic limestones and dolomites and late Triassic sandstones and shales (Keuper). The Triassic rocks are overlain by shales, marls and shaly limestones of Jurassic to early Cretaceous age (Bündnerschiefer Formation). Locally, sandstones, breccias and arcoses occur. Associated with the sediments are ophiolites and other basic intrusions and volcanics. The youngest sediments proven so far are of early Cretaceous age but by comparison with lithologically similar sediments in the Lower Engadin Window and the Penninic realm in the Western Alps the occurrence of younger sediments seems at least possible. Tectonically two nappes are generally delineated (Frisch, 1976): the lower Venediger nappe comprising most of the pre-Mesozoic rocks and relatively little Mesozoic sediments and volcanics and the higher Glockner nappe including most of the Triassic rocks, the Bündnerschiefer and the ophiolites. Both nappes were later folded, forming a huge anticline with an axis following approximately the main ridge of the Alps. Apart from the pre-Mesozoic metamorphism three episodes of metamorphic events were recognized: an eclogite event, a blueschist metamorphism, and the final greenschist to amphibolite facies metamorphism called ""Tauernkristallisation"" by SANDER (1912). The eclogitisation affects only a relatively small strip mainly at the southern escarpment of the Tauern Window, the blueschist metamorphism is more widely distributed but restricted to the ophiolites, their immediate cover and the areas tectonically below. The Tertiary greenschist to amphibolite facies metamorphism can be seen in all rocks of the Tauern Window.",,

Abstract This study has obtained estimates of the kinetics and fractional excretion factors of metabolism of DEHP and DINP to their main primary and secondary metabolites. Samples were obtained from an open-label, fixed sequence, single oral dose study in 10 male and 10 female subjects. The dosed substances were deuterated di-2-ethylhexylphthalate (D 4 -DEHP) and di-isononylphthalate (D 4 -DINP) at two dose levels. Urine samples were collected at intervals up to 48 h post-dose. LC–MS/MS was used to measure metabolite concentrations. Excreted amounts were then calculated using urine volumes. Metabolite half-lives were estimated to be 4–8 h with more than 90% of metabolites in the first 24 h of urine collections and the remainder in the 24–48 h period. The four metabolites of DEHP amounted to 47.1 ± 8.5% fractional excretion on a molar basis. For DINP the identified metabolites totalled 32.9 ± 6.4%. For both DEHP and DINP the metabolites were in the abundance order -monoester < -oxo < -carboxy < -hydroxy. These robust fractional excretion values for the main primary and secondary phthalate metabolites along with estimates of their uncertainty can be used in future surveys of human exposure to DEHP and DINP.

It is common to quantify levels of human exposure to chemicals by measuring their metabolites in urine. The EU has recognised that the DEHP risk assessment conducted under the Existing Substances Regulation (793/93/EEC) requires information from human studies on the fraction of DEHP that is excreted as the different DEHP-metabolites in urine, i.e. conversion factors for different metabolites ( EU, 1993 ). Earlier studies have only estimated these factors. Schmid and Schlatter (1985) investigated DEHP (30 mg) taken orally by two volunteers and determined 12 metabolites in urine using GC–MS. Rapid excretion of between 10% and 15% of the dose (on a w/w basis) was eliminated in urine within 24 h. Anderson et al. (2001) analysed urine from eight volunteers to determine the kinetics and conversion factors for monoesters as the primary metabolites of seven phthalates including DEHP and isomeric dioctylphthalate (DIOP) mixture. Results for DEHP and DIOP were combined because they could not be separated (as MEHP and MIOP) by the LC–MS method used and so this required some assumptions; for example on LC–MS response factors. They estimated that 13 ± 6% of the combined dose (on a molar basis) was excreted as the monoesters. Interest has since increased in the secondary metabolites of phthalates. These arise by hydrolysis of the parent diester to the monoester (the primary metabolite) followed by side-chain oxidation. For simplicity here, even sequential oxidation products of the side-chain will be referred to as secondary metabolites, unless there is a specific need to distinguish secondary from tertiary metabolites. The secondary metabolites may provide more robust exposure markers than primary metabolites ( Koch et al., 2003 ). On the question of primary and secondary metabolites, following oral exposure DEHP is hydrolysed by lipases in the small intestine and is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract ( EU, 1993 ) in the form of monoethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP). MEHP is converted to its oxidative-metabolites in the liver; namely mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (5OH-MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (5oxo-MEHP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (5cx-MEPP). Both the primary and the secondary metabolites are excreted rapidly in the urine, with excretion occurring mostly within 24 h post dose ( Schmid and Schlatter, 1985 ). Less information is available on the absorption, metabolism and excretion of DINP in humans and the chemically complex nature of the isomeric C 9 -alkyl side chain increases the number of potential oxidation products. By analogy with DEHP, the primary metabolite is mono-iso-nonylphthalate (MINP) and the main secondary metabolites are mono-(4-methyl-7-hydroxy-octyl) phthalate (7OH-MMeOP), mono-(4-methyl-7-oxo-octyl) phthalate (7oxo-MMeOP) and mono-(4-methyl-7-carboxyheptyl) phthalate (7cx-MMeHP). The research group of Koch et al. has published conversion factors for metabolites from DEHP and DINP. For DEHP ( Koch et al., 2005 ) conversion factors for MEHP, 5OH-MEHP, 5oxo-MEHP and 5cx-MEPP were based on urinary analysis from a volunteer administered deuterated DEHP in doses of 0.35, 2.15, and 48.5 mg separated by weekly intervals. Similarly, conversion factors for DINP metabolised to MINP, 7OH-MMeOP, 7oxo-MMeOP and 7cx-MMeHP were obtained from a volunteer, following a single dose of 98.5 mg deuterated DINP ( Koch and Angerer, 2007 ). Their results provided the first estimates of conversion factors for these secondary metabolites and demonstrated that secondary metabolites were present at higher levels in urine than primary metabolites. Their work also included measurement of phthalate metabolites in blood. Measurements in blood can be useful in the development of complete pharmacokinetic modelling, but taking blood samples is too invasive for general population surveys of biomarkers of exposure. So for this reason, interest here is limited to metabolites in urine. This earlier work was for a single volunteer only, however. The aim of the present study was to determine more robust kinetic estimates and fractional excretion factors for the 4 main metabolites of DEHP and of DINP in urine using deuterated phthalates given at two dose levels to 10 male and 10 female volunteers. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Labelled phthalates for dosing D 4 -DEHP and D 4 -DINP obtained from Dr. A. Haunert (BASF, Ludwigshafen, DE) were synthesised by reaction of ring-labelled phthalic acid with a 10-mol excess of the corresponding alcohol using a butyltitanate catalyst. Unreacted alcohol was removed by evaporation and the products were purified by silica gel column chromatography. The chemical and isotopic purity were assessed by BASF using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. For DEHP the isotopic purity was 98.9% and the chemical purity was >99%. For DINP the isotopic purity was 99.2% and the chemical purity was >99%. The amounts of these phthalates dosed to volunteers were corrected for chemical and isotopic purity accordingly. 2.2 Preparation of the dose materials The high dose material was D 4 -DEHP (ca. 0.12 g) and D 4 -DINP (ca. 0.36 g) dissolved in 200 mL of extra virgin olive oil. A portion (20 mL) was diluted ten-fold with olive oil to give the low dose material. The dose materials were stored refrigerated. The oil samples were analysed in triplicate by LC–MS/MS. The system was calibrated using a range of matrix-matched calibration standards prepared from both analytes at ca. 0, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 ng/mL. The calibrants used were D 4 -DEHP (Cambridge Isotopes) certified standard at a concentration of 96.5 ± 1.2 μg/mL in acetonitrile and D 4 -DINP (BASF) 201.6 μg/mL in propan-2-ol. The concentrations of the low dose oil were 61.7 ± 1.6 μg/mL D 4 -DEHP and 156.4 ± 3.9 μg/mL D 4 -DINP. The high dose oil was 620.3 ± 14.8 μg/mL D 4 -DEHP and 1617 ± 89 μg/mL D 4 -DINP. 2.3 Analytical standards The monoesters D 4 -MEHP and D 4 -MINP (>99.5% pure) were obtained from Dr. A. Haunert (BASF) and were structurally directly related to the D 4 -DEHP and D 4 -DINP doses. The phthalates were obtained by esterification of D 4 -phthalic acid (Sigma–Aldrich, Munich, DE; 99% D atom) with the corresponding alcohol; 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and Nonanol® N respectively. For D 4 -MINP this represented the deuterium analogue of the commercial product Palatinol® N (CAS No. 28553-12-0) which is of comparable composition to VESTINOL® 9 (OXENO Olefinchemie GmbH, Marl, DE). Both DINP products are referred to in the literature as DINP2 (solely consisting of branched alkyl chains) in contrast to DINP1 (CAS 68515-48-0) with C8-C10 (approx. 75% C9) branched alkyl chains ( JRC, 2003 ). The secondary metabolites for D 4 -DEHP; i.e. D 4 -5OH-MEHP, D 4 -5oxo-MEHP and D 4 -5cx-MEPP along with the secondary metabolites for D 4 -DINP; i.e. D 4 -7OH-MMeOP, D 4 -7oxo-MMeOP and D 4 -7cx-MMeHP, were synthesised by Dr. Hans-Detlev (IDM, Teltow, DE) following the procedures of Gilsing et al. (2002, 2003, 2005) . Importantly, the secondary oxidised metabolites of D 4 -DINP were derived from the side chain component, 4-methyl-1-octyl, previously shown to be the major side chain of both DINP1 and DINP2 ( Koch et al., 2007 ). All secondary metabolites had a chemical purity of >97% and the isotopic purity of all labelled standards was tested by LC–MS/MS and shown to contain no measurable unlabelled or partially labelled compound. Acetonitrile, water (HPLC grade), acetic acid (glacial, extra pure) and ammonium acetate (p.a.) were from Sigma–Aldrich (Gillingham, UK). β-Glucuronidase (from E. Coli K12, ref: 03 707 598 001) was from Roche biomedical (Mannheim, DE). 4-Methyl umbelliferone glucuronide (MUG) was from Sigma–Aldrich. 4-Methylumbelliferone (MU) and 13 C 4 -4-MU (2,3,4,methyl- 13 C 4 -MU) were from LGC Standards (Teddington, UK). Stock solutions of isotopically labelled phthalate metabolites (ca. 400 μg/mL), MU and 13 C 4 -MU, were prepared in acetonitrile and stored at −20 °C in Teflon-capped amber glass bottles. Intermediate metabolite standard mixes of 40 μg/mL were prepared in 1:9 acetonitrile: ammonium acetate (1 M, pH 6.5) with serial dilutions to give 20, 5, 0.5 and 0.25 μg/mL in ammonium acetate (1 M, pH 6.5). 2.4 Volunteers Selected volunteer demographics are summarised in Table 1 . Healthy male or female subjects without regard to ethnic origin, aged greater than 18 years, with a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 32 kg/m 2 inclusive, and with a body weight >60 kg, were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in the ethically approved protocol. The most important criteria were as follows: The subjects were all in good health. None were on any prescribed or over-the-counter systemic or topical medication within 14 days of the first dose administration or during the study itself. Exceptions were vitamin or mineral supplements (leading up to the study only) and (for female subjects) stable hormone replacement therapy and oral contraception. Subjects were only moderate drinkers, consuming no more than 28 units of alcohol per week for males and no more than 21 units for females. One unit of alcohol is 10 mL and UK advise is that consumption above 4 units per day for males or 3 units per day for females is not advisable. None of the subjects had a significant history of alcoholism or other drug/chemical abuse. Similarly, smokers of more than 15 cigarettes or the equivalent in tobacco per day were excluded. There was no alcohol consumption allowed during the study itself but volunteers were permitted their usual level of smoking. 2.5 Dose selection and experimental design Dose levels per person were 4.5 mL of the high dose olive oil and 5.0 mL of the low dose oil. This equated to 0.31 and 0.78 mg of D 4 -DEHP and D 4 -DINP respectively in the low dose and 2.8 and 7.3 mg D 4 -DEHP and D 4 -DINP respectively in the high dose. The high dose of D 4 -DEHP (0.047 mg/kg bw) was justified as very close to but not greater than the tolerable daily intake value (TDI) of 0.05 mg/kg bw for a 60 kg human (60 kg being the minimum body weight for inclusion in the study) recommended by ( EFSA, 2005a ). Similarly, the high dose of DINP (0.121 mg/kg bw) was justified as being very close to but not greater than the TDI of 0.15 mg/kg bw ( EFSA, 2005b ). The low dose level was chosen as being approximately one-tenth of the high dose and so one-tenth of the TDI values. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki ( WHO, 2000 ) and ICH GCP consolidated guideline ( ICH, 1996 ). The study was an open-label, fixed sequence, single oral dose study in 10 healthy male and 10 healthy female subjects. Each subject received a single oral dose of both D 4 -DEHP and D 4 -DINP at two different dose levels in two study periods. Screening commenced in the 3-week period prior to dosing. Subjects remained in the Covance Research Unit (CRU) from approximately 4 pm on Day-1 (the day prior to dose administration) until Day 3 (48 h post dose). Dosing occurred on Day 1 of each study period for each subject with a minimum of 7 days between doses. Intervals of 7 days between doses was considered adequate to prevent within-subject carryover of phthalate esters and their primary and secondary metabolites. 2.6 Study conduct During the study, subjects reported to the CRU at approximately 4 pm on the day before each dose administration and remained there for not less than 48 h after each dosing occasion. Standard meals were provided for all subjects whilst resident in the CRU. Subjects were fasted from approximately 10 pm on the day prior to dose administration until dosing. The dose was added to a piece of bread which the subject ate as part of a standard breakfast. The dosings were staggered in time so that each subject could be observed individually to ensure the complete dose was eaten. Fluid (200 mL) was administered to subjects at minus-2, zero (with breakfast) and then after 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36 and 39 h post-dose. This minimum quantity of drink was given to ensure that some urine was passed at the collection intervals required. In addition, subjects were allowed free access to water. Caffeine-containing foods and beverages as well as grapefruit and grapefruit juice (well known to inhibit certain metabolic processes) were not allowed from 48 h prior to each dosing and until leaving the CRU. Urine samples were collected into standard weight polyethylene containers over the time intervals; Pre dose, 0–4, 4–8, 8–12, 12–24, 24–36, and 36–48 h post dose. Urine volume (mL) produced during each interval was recorded for each subject. A 90 mL portion was stored at approximately −70 °C. When less than 90 mL urine was produced, the whole amount available was stored. Boric acid (2% w/v) was added as preservative. A total of 280 urine samples (20 volunteers, two dosing levels and 7 time points each) were generated for analysis. 2.7 Urine sample preparation Urine samples were removed from −70 °C storage and were defrosted at room temperature or in a refrigerator overnight. Samples were then swirled gently and inverted several times to ensure mixing. A portion of each sample (1 mL) was analysed along with two further portions for standard additions. To optimise the level of standard addition, samples were allocated into one of two groups. The first (high) group were expected to be at high concentrations and were all the high dose samples and the early time points of the low dose. The low concentration group were all others. Standard additions for samples with low expected levels (approx. 1–50 ng/mL) had additions of 0, 25, and 50 ng per mL. Samples with higher expected levels (approx. 50–500 ng/mL) had additions of 0, 500 and 2000 ng/mL. All additions were made in 100 μL of ammonium acetate (1 M, pH 6.5) containing metabolite standards at zero, 250, 500, 5000 and 20000 ng/mL for 0, 25, 50, 500 and 2000 ng additions respectively. Quality control (QC) samples (see Section 2.9 below) were treated in the same manner. Following standard addition, β-glucuronidase (5 μL), MUG (20 μl of 4 μg/mL) and 13 C 4 -MU (20 μL of 1 μg/mL) were added to each sample. Each sample was vortex-mixed for 5 s and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. The samples were removed from the incubator and stored at −70 °C until analysis. The samples were thawed at room temperature and vortex-mixed for approximately 5 s prior to LC–MS/MS analysis. 2.8 LC–MS analysis of urines Samples were analysed for D 4 -MEHP (primary metabolite), D 4 -5oxo-MEHP, D 4 -5OH-MEHP and D 4 -5-carboxy-MEPP (secondary metabolites). For D 4 -DINP they were D 4 -MINP (primary) and D 4 -7oxo-MMeOP, D 4 -7OH-MMeOP and D 4 -7-cx-MMeHP (secondary). Each analytical batch comprised ten samples with each sample analysed as such (S) and with two levels of standard addition (S1 and S2). Each sample set (S, S1 and S2) was followed by injection of a system blank solvent check of ammonium acetate (1 M, pH 6.5). The batch of samples was bracketed by QC samples. LC was performed using a Waters Alliance 2695 LC system. The injection volume was 500 μL for those samples expected to have lower concentrations of analytes (i.e. standard addition regime 1) and was 300 μL for samples expected to have higher concentrations (i.e. standard addition regime 2). Low and high samples were batched separately. Where high metabolite concentrations were found outside the linear range of the instrument, these were diluted with ammonium acetate buffer to fit into the linear concentration range and reanalysed. The LC–MS/MS method of Koch et al., 2007 was followed with minor modifications. The large volume injection was made onto a pre-enrichment cartridge (Phenomenex Primesphere 5 μm 30 × 4.6 mm C18–C110 Å) where the metabolites of interest were retained and unwanted material was passed to waste. The concentrated analytes were then flushed onto the analytical column (Synergi 4 μm Fusion-RP 80 Å 250 × 3.0 mm). The mobile phase was a gradient of solvent A (0.25% acetic acid in methanol:water; 10:90), solvent B (0.25% acetic acid in methanol:water; 90:10) and solvent C (methanol). The LC was coupled to a Waters Micromass Quattro Ultima MS/MS for multiple reaction monitoring in negative ion electrospray mode. The MS parameters and ions monitored are listed in Table 2 . The limits of quantification were estimated to be ca. 0.1 ng/mL for D 4 -DEHP metabolites and 0.25 ng/mL for D 4 -DINP metabolites. Concentrations of the metabolites were determined by the standard addition procedure described above and derived from the intercept of the regression line of (S, S1 and S2) with the x-axis. 2.9 Data analysis and analytical quality control The concentration in ng/mL of each metabolite determined in urine was multiplied by the total urine volume collected (mL) for that timepoint. The metabolite mass was then converted into nanomoles. The molar fraction excreted (percentage) of each metabolite excreted in the urine was calculated as 100 × (moles-found/moles-dosed). Standard addition methodology removes the requirements for determining analytical recovery as this is inherent in the technique if the recovery value is stable enough. However, to check the method integrity, in house reference materials (IHRMs) at high and low levels and solvent and urine blanks were analysed with each batch. The two IHRMs comprised the 48 h urine from two volunteers collected after doses of (0.31 mg D 4 -DEHP and 0.78 mg D 4 -DINP) and (2.8 mg D 4 -DEHP and 7.3 mg D 4 -DINP) in olive oil. Externally spiked low (10 ng/mL) and high (300 ng/mL) urine samples for recovery batch calculations were prepared weekly from fresh urine collections volunteered by a member of staff. Analytical batches consisted of either low or high IHRMs and spikes dependent on whether the batches were for the low or high concentrations anticipated. 3 Results For clarity of reading hereafter, the D 4 -prefix has been dropped. 3.1 Chromatography Fig 1 shows a chromatograph for an enzymatically deconjugated urine sample obtained from a volunteer during the 0–4 h collection after the low dose. As expected, the metabolites of DEHP ( Fig. 1 a) shown as single peaks whereas the DINP metabolites ( Fig. 1 b) comprise a number of unresolved peaks reflecting the isomeric composition of the C 9 -side chain. Each of these clusters of peaks was integrated as a single entity. 3.2 Excretion kinetics Fig. 2 a and b shows the arithmetic cumulative elimination profiles for the metabolites of DEHP from the low dose and high dose respectively. Fig. 3 a and b shows the elimination profiles for the metabolites of DINP from the low dose and high dose respectively. For clarity, the data are the average molar excretion values for all 20 subjects (10 males and 10 females for each figure) irrespective of gender. The 4 named metabolites are plotted along with the total value as their sum. As expected from the literature, uptake, metabolism and excretion were rapid with half-life values of about 4–8 h. The 4 h interval for urine collections in the study design does not allow a very precise estimation of half-lives within this 4–8 h timescale. 3.3 Between-individual variability The 280 analytical results formed 8 data sets; these being the two phthalates DEHP and DINP tested at two dose levels in two genders, each data set thereby comprising 10 volunteers. The between-individual variability was assessed by drawing box-and-whisker plots for each of the 8 groups. Figs. 4a and 4b are illustrative, for low dose DEHP females and for high dose DINP males respectively. 3.4 Test for congruence by dose and by gender The experiment used a factorial design with factors Gender (male, female) and Dose (low, high). Each subject received each dose in the order low followed by high with a wash-out period of 7 days in between doses. As the order of doses was not randomised, effects of dose are allied with order – so any interpretation of dose effects must consider the possibility that the effect is related to the order not wholly or in part to the dose received. Data were examined prior to analysis and a number of outlying high observations were apparent. Some of these were consistent for particular subjects across more than one metabolite. Where outliers were well separated from the bulk of the data, two analyses were performed on the data: first on the full data set and then excluding the outliers in order to see if this would affect the results and inferences. No such affect was observed so results given here are for all data (i.e. including outliers) and no evidence was found to invalidate an assumption of normal distribution. Analysis was by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with subject as a “blocking” factor and treatment factors Gender crossed with Dose. Following analysis of variance, residuals were checked to confirm adequacy of the statistical model, which was acceptable in all cases notwithstanding some occasional large outliers. For metabolites of DEHP, the primary metabolite MEHP was the only compound to show statistically significant effects of gender: (female 5.52, male 7.10, SED (standard error of a difference between 2 means) = 0.690; F1, 18 = 5.72, P < 0.05). For all other metabolites there were no detectable effects of gender ( P > 0.05). Metabolite 5OH-MEHP had no detectable effects of dose ( P > 0.05) from ANOVA with or without outlying values. All other 3 metabolites (and their total) had statistically significant effects of dose ( P < 0.001) and this was unchanged when analysed without the outlying values for 5oxo-MEHP and 5cx-MEPP. No statistically significant interactions between gender and dose were found in any analysis. Results in Table 3 are for the full data set including the outliers ( Table 3 ). For metabolites of DINP, statistically significant effects were detected only for the effect of dose on measured MINP (low dose 3.44, high dose 2.73 Standard Error of Difference = 0.216; F1, 18 = 10.67, P = 0.004). All other dose effects were not statistically significant ( P > 0.05); similarly there were no statistically significant effects of gender. There were no statistically significant effects ( P > 0.05) of either gender or dose on the total of all metabolites ( Table 4 ). 3.5 Tests for normality The results for all compounds were tested for the assumption that they fitted a normal distribution. An example of one of the diagnostic plots displaying normal distribution for 5oxo-MEHP is given in Fig. 5 . This plot is typical of all the other compounds examined and illustrates that the data may be assumed to be normal for the purposes of statistical analysis. 4 Discussion 4.1 Relevance of the use of deuterated substances The use of deuterium-labelled phthalates ( Anderson et al., 2001; Koch et al., 2004; Koch and Angerer, 2007 ) circumvents many of the problems that can arise from background levels of phthalate metabolites since it is virtually impossible to keep volunteers on a completely phthalate-free diet or to completely avoid phthalate contamination during sample analysis. Since both primary and secondary metabolism of DEHP and DINP occurs at the alky side-chains at least 4 bonds from the labels on the aromatic ring, it can be expected that there will be no significant secondary kinetic isotope effect and the kinetics and fractional excretion factors established here will apply directly to the unlabelled phthalates too. 4.2 Completeness of deconjugation The deconjugation of 4-methyl umbelliferone glucuronide (MUG) was used to check for the completeness of hydrolysis of the phthalate metabolites in urine. The ratio of unlabelled MU (hydrolysed from MUG) to 13 C 4 -MU (spiked into samples) was monitored by the LC–MS/MS and plotted on a control chart to check that each sample had hydrolysed completely. Silva et al. (2008) have demonstrated that MUG is an excellent indicator for the hydrolysis of phthalate glucuronides since they follow a similar pattern. They also showed that as little as 50-times less than the normal quantity of enzyme used was sufficient to ensure complete deconjugation. Since we used the same source of enzyme and the same quantity and incubation conditions as Silva et al. (2008), and since the control charts were stable (not shown), we are confident that deconjugation of the phthalate metabolites was complete. 4.3 Excretion kinetics As expected from the literature, described in Section 1 , the uptake, metabolism and excretion of both DEHP and DINP was rapid. The half-life values for each of the four metabolites monitored for each phthalate, were in the time window of ca. 4–8 h. The fixed time intervals of 4 h used for urine collection limited a more precise estimation of t 0.5 . More than 90% of each metabolite appeared in the urine collections within the first 24 h with only a minor fraction in the second day of collection, between 24 and 48 h. For DEHP, the second day of collection contained only 1.1%, 3.7%, 4.3%, 5.0% and 3.9% of the recovered MEHP, 5oxo-MEHP, 5OH-MEHP, 5-carboxy-MEPP and total metabolites, respectively. For DINP the corresponding values were 2.6%, 4.9%, 7.2%, 9.6% and 7.1% of MINP, 7oxo-MMeOP, 7OH-MMeOP, 7cx-MMeHP and total metabolites, respectively. It may be significant that the monoesters, being the primary metabolites and so the fastest to appear, were the least important in the second day of collection, at only 1.1% and 2.6%. Conversely, it may also be significant that the most extensively metabolised products, 5-carboxy-MEPP and 7-carboxy-MMeHP, had the highest excretion in the 2nd day of collection, at 5.0% and 9.6% of the dose respectively. All of the metabolites have a short half-life however and this has consequences in the design of any general population survey for exposure to phthalate ( Preau et al., 2010 ). For spot urine samples, depending on the time of day and on the times of eating occasions, the phthalate metabolites will at best reflect only the one or two most recent eating occasions – for example only breakfast and lunch if the urine sample was taken early afternoon – because earlier meals will be several half-lives away. 4.4 Grouping of data to determine means Given that the data for each metabolite are distributed normally and that dependency on dose and gender is either not statistically significant or, if significant statistically is not significant to estimating exposure, then it is justifiable to define the biomarkers of exposure as the whole data set for the 0–24 h and the 0–48 h molar fractional excretion values for each metabolite as summarised in Tables 5 and 6 . 4.5 Molar excretion factors The percentage of the administered dose for each of the 4 metabolites from DEHP and from DINP are summarised in Tables 5 and 6 for the 0–24 h and the 0–48 h urine collection periods. Values are in mole units (i.e. corrected for molecular weight) and are the average of the high and low dose for both genders. Thus, each value is the arithmetic mean for 40 individuals each giving 4 (0–24) or 6 (0–48 h) individual urine collections. Because the distribution of results was established to be normal (see above), Tables 5 and 6 also shows the standard deviation and the relative standard deviation on the means. Considering the results in Tables 5 and 6 , the primary metabolites MEHP and MINP are the least abundant at 6.3% and 3.1% of the dose. There was also an indication (described in Section 4.3 above) that the primary metabolites have a slightly shorter half-life than the secondary metabolites. Lastly, the primary metabolites also show the largest variability of the 4 metabolites with RSD values of 31% and 33%. Considering the secondary metabolites, the order of abundance is -oxo < -carboxy < -hydroxy. For DEHP the difference is not very great but for DINP the -oxo metabolite is much lower than the other two. The variability for the 3 secondary metabolites of DEHP is similar as all have RSD values of 20–25%. For the 3 secondary metabolites of DINP the RSD is in the range 26–28%. Interestingly, the variability of the total result (sum of all four metabolites) is lower at 18% and 19% for DEHP and DINP respectively, than all of the RSD values for the individuals. This is an indication that there is some compensation, where to some extent at the level of the individual person, a high excretion factor for one metabolite is counterbalanced by a low excretion factor for another. A full chemometrics analysis of the data set may reveal stronger evidence for compensation but this was outside the scope of the study. The variability values in Tables 5 and 6 describe the between-individual variability in excretion factors but they also include an element of the variability of the analytical measurements – more properly expressed as measurement uncertainty. Because of the short half-life the results for each individual are dominated by 3 urine collections, 0–4, 4–8 and 8–12 h, since these contain about 80% of the total excreted metabolites and the subsequent collections make only a relatively minor contribution to the total. This being so, the effects of method variability will be partly but not completely nullified – since being random scatter these will average-out somewhat over the 3 measurements. 4.6 Comparison with literature values Tables 5 and 6 also give the values reported by ( Koch et al., 2005, 2007 ) for the same 4 metabolites of DEHP and DINP as reported here. The literature values are similar but generally higher than the values determined here for the percentage excretion. The literature values are not given with an estimation of uncertainty (in part because they were based on a single individual) but even treated as fixed points they are mostly within about two standard deviations of the results found here. Taking the 2-day values (44 or 48 h, respectively) the results for the single Koch et al. volunteer are −0.20, 1.52, 2.62 and 1.64 standard deviations from our results for 20 volunteers for DEHP metabolites and are −0.94, 2.26, 2.46 and −0.07 standard deviations away for DiNP metabolites. The values are certainly within the span of individual values for the 20 volunteers studied in this work (e.g. Figs. 4a and 4b ). The agreement is satisfactory, especially considering that the literature values are for a single volunteer only with up to 48 mg DEHP dose and a single DINP dose of 99 mg. The consequence of the differences is that, if analysing urine samples and applying a conversion factor to the results to estimate exposure, the conversion factors (and so the estimates of exposure) will be slightly higher using our results since the conversion factor is a simple reciprocal of the fractional excretion value. Lorber et al. (2010) recently reprocessed the original Koch data and showed that the ratio of the tertiary metabolite, 5cx-MEPP, to the secondary metabolite, 5OH-MEHP, increased with time after dose to eventually get to a ratio of about 2.0. They suggested that this trend could be used to gain insight as to when the last exposure to DEHP occurred in a spot urine sample. For the results of the present study, the means and standard deviations for the two metabolites in ratio were calculated for all 20 individuals for each of the high dose groups. Individual ratios that were more than 2 standard deviations from this first raw mean were excluded and the mean and standard deviation were recalculated. For DEHP this eliminated 6 of the potential 100 data points and for DINP it eliminated 5 of the potential 100 data points, these being 20 each for the 5 time intervals reported below. The metabolite concentrations in the 36–48 h samples were too low, and often below the detection limit, to ratio accurately for DEHP and for DINP. For DEHP (high dose) the ratio of 5cx-MEPP to 5OH-MEHP increased as follows: 0.63 ± 0.28, 0.68 ± 0.25, 1.15 ± 0.39, 1.25 ± 0.56 and 1.78 ± 0.69 for 0–4, 4–8, 8–12, 12–24 and 24–36 h urine samples respectively. For the corresponding tertiary and secondary metabolites from DINP (high dose), these being 7cx-MMeHP and 7OH-MMeOP, the ratios for the 5 time intervals also increased, as follows: 0.48 ± 0.20, 0.65 ± 0.21, 1.27 ± 0.42, 1.27 ± 0.34 and 1.37 ± 0.48. Thus, in agreement with Lorber et al. (2010) , the ratio of the two metabolites does increase with time after exposure. However it should be noted that the ratio shows considerable between-individual variability and also that the ratio does not change much until late after exposure when the metabolite concentrations in urine are dwindling away. So this simple ratio may not be a very powerful tool to help limit the uncertainty inherent in taking spot urine samples and not knowing exactly when exposure took place beforehand. A more extensive statistical treatment of all the metabolite results for the 20 volunteers, is planned in a follow-up project. 4.7 Limitations and uncertainties These results and conclusions derive from 10 male and 10 female volunteers. They were all adults aged 18 years or more ( Table 1 ). The study was open to healthy male or female subjects of any ethnic origin but all the volunteers were Caucasian ( Table 1 ). Consequently results should not be applied to a consideration of children or to races other than Caucasian without an explicit statement of any assumptions made. 5 Conclusions We have analysed urine samples from a human dosing study conducted with 20 volunteers under strict clinical control. This has derived robust estimates of the kinetics and fractional excretion values for the main primary and secondary phthalate metabolites along with an estimate of their uncertainty. These values can be used in the future for surveys of exposure to DEHP and DINP via analysis of their urinary biomarkers.

It is situated in the Plock Trough, in the SW part of the Plonsk Block, and represents a synsedimentary graben originated in the Early and Middle Jurassic. It has been explored by a semi-detailed reflection seismic survey and three deep boreholes (Kamionki 1, Kamionki 2 and Kamionki IG-3). Assuming that the anticline is conventionally outlined by a contour line of the top of the Lower Jurassic, its length is about 15 km, width is about 5 kin and the area reaches approximately 75 km(2). Geological, seismic and reservoir property data allow concluding that this structure is suitable for underground carbon dioxide storage, The primary reservoir level for underground CO2 storage is represented by Barremian-middle Albian deposits of the Mogilno Formation with an average thickness of 170 metres, containing on the average 85% of sandstones, and showing porosity of about 20% and permeability above 100 mD up to 2000 mD. The scaling series is composed of Upper Cretaceous marls, limestones and chalk reaching the thickness of about 1000 metres. The secondary reservoir level is represented by upper Toarcian deposits of the Borucice Formation. The Kamionki structure is one of nine geological structures selected for underground carbon dioxide storage in Mesozoic deposits of the Plock Trough. It is located a short distance from a large CO2 emitter - PKN Orlen SA (Plock), whereas at a distance of 50-100 km there arc other large emitters (Vettenfall Heat Poland SA - Zeran, Soda Polska Ciech Sp. z o.o. - Janikowo and Inowroclaw, and Dalkia Lodz ZEC SA) that may be interested in geological disposal of carbon dioxide.",,

Tabriz is located in the northwest of Iran and has different cohesive soils including clay, silt, and different types of yellow, green, and gray marl with different settlement potential. Twenty undisturbed samples of these layers were prepared from three drilling boreholes with depth of 8 m. Geotechnical tests were performed for determining the plasticity and consolidation properties. The shear wave velocity (Vs) in the samples was also measured by using bender element test. Next, the data resulting from this study were combined with available similar data in the literature for validation of 25 existing empirical equations in order to predict Cc.

Furthermore, artificial neural network (ANN) analysis with one and two hidden layers with the Vs as the input variable of the network has been performed. The results obtained from this study indicated that in terms of both, the Spearman correlation coefficient and contribution percentage of input variables of the ANN, the Vs was an effective variable in estimation of the compression index and could be utilized for this purpose.

This contribution aims at determining rapid changes in land cover and land use and modeling of soil erosion in the study area where we have little data. Analysis of satellite data has identified six main types of land (Land severely degraded, cereal, mix cereal and tree crops, trees, and reforestation) in the watershed of Oued El Mellah north the city of Fez (Morocco). After the loss of soil have been estimated by the RUSLE module integrated into the GIS Idrisi, the results allowed the identification of sectors across the basin where interventions are needed to limit the process of land degradation. Introduction Soil erosion is a growing problem in the north of Morocco, particularly in the Pre-Rif domain. It negatively affects agricultural productivity, reduces water infiltration, underground water resources and water availability. Previous studies of erosion and soil loss quantification in the Moroccan Rif and Prerif mountains were essentially qualitative and apprehended erosion processes and the resulting landforms (Heusch et al. 1970, Benmoussa et al. 1993, Daghmoumi 1994, Ait Fora 1995, Rahhou 1999, Al Karkouri 2003, Siteri et al. 2003). The scientific quantification of erosion and soil loss in Morocco is still lacking. The model usually adopted over the world to achieve such evaluation was the universal equation of soil loss by USLE (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978). However, in the Moroccan context, the application of the model may be problematic and should be tested to apprehend its effectiveness mainly in the Rif and Prerif region. This area is mountainous, with very steep slopes, and the 1 PhD., University Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah, o_elaroussi@yahoo.fr 2 Prof. PhD., Faculty of Letters and Human Sciences Saïss, Fez-Morocco El Aroussi, Mesrar, El Garouani, Lahrach, Beaabidate, Akdim, Jabrane 6 development of gullies and even badlands is frequent. The previous applications of the model had been operated on sheet erosion, with hilly landforms and slope inclination less than 20%. The present study aims to apply this model to the Oued El Mellah watershed, in the Prerif, where conditions are most suitable (agricultural land, slopes do not exceed 20%). The mapping approach was used to apprehend the factors involved in erosion processes: the aggressiveness of rainfall, slope, slope length, the soil erodibility, vegetation cover and tillage practices. In the current study, an effort to predict potential annual soil losses has been conducted using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) adopted in a Geographical Information System framework. It is used for the prediction of sheet erosion depending on the distribution of the aggressiveness of rainfall, the erodibility of soil, topography, land use practices and crop management. GIS (ArcGis 9.3, Idrisi Andes) and remote sensing data are both used for modeling of soil erosion in the Oued El Melleh watershed. Results are illustrated in a map that allows the prioritization of the action across the watershed. 1. Study site The Oued El Malleh catchment (fig. 1) is located at the North of Fez city and extends on the Prerif domain. Its area is approximately 34 km2. It is bordered in the East and North by the Oued Sebou valley, in the West by the Oued Mekkes catchment and in the South by the Saiss plain, with altitudes varying between 250 m and 900 m (Jbel Zalagh). Fig. 1 Localization and Digital Elevation Model of the El Malleh catchment The potential annual soil loss using the revised universal soil loss equation 7 2. Physical environment 2.1. Slope. The map of the spatial distribution of topographic slope of the Basin of Oued El Malleh was generated from a Digital Elevation Model with 5m resolution. This map shows a very abrupt relief with slopes exceeding 80% along Jabal Zalagh (fig. 2). Fig. 2 Slopes of the El Malleh catchment 2.2. Geology. The study area belongs to the Pre-Rif domain where several geological formations appear at the catchment scale. We observe different sedimentary deposits of different ages (fig 3): Gypsiferous clays and salt Triasic in age at the North-West basin (Essahlaoui et al., 2001), Calcareous sandstone which is Liasic in age at the Jbel Tghat and Jbel Zalagh; Miocene marls with interbedded sandstone; Pliocene conglomerates at he Merinids site; The quaternary travertine supporting the Medina of Fez; The basin is crossed by Oued El Malleh and oriented from the West to the East. There are several springs in the basin but their discharge is low. El Aroussi, Mesrar, El Garouani, Lahrach, Beaabidate, Akdim, Jabrane 8 2.3. Soil types and textures. Four different types of soil textures are observed in the area: • the sandy texture for aerated soil, with a high nutrient content 10 and C2 units; • the silty texture, for a fairly solid ground, rich oozes, and poor physical properties 4, 15, 16 and C1 units; • the clay texture, in soils rich in clay, poorly ventilated, impervious and difficult to cultivate 17 unit; • the balanced texture corresponding to the optimal texture, with all the qualities of the previous types 3 and 19 units. Fig. 3 Geology of the El Malleh catchment Complementary analyses were made on these soils (Fig. 4) and show that: Equivalent humidity is very high for the undeveloped soil (5-11%) the lowest values are found in the calcimagnesic soil (from 2% to 4%). pH is moderately basic (between 7.89 and 9.88). CaCO3 levels vary between 37% and 68% for the undeveloped soil and 40% for calcimagnesic soils. The potential annual soil loss using the revised universal soil loss equation 9 organic matter content is very high for Vertisols (5.83), and minimum values are observed for calcimagnesic soils (between 0.67% and 1.29%). Fig. 4 Soil humidity, calcimetry, organic matter content and pH Following these results, the Oued El Malh catchment is a fragile context that favors erosion, considering its topographic, geologic and pedologic characteristics. 3. Potential soil loss estimation 3.1. Methodology and measurements. The RUSLE module was integrated in the Idrisi software. This module not only calculates soil losses for each pixel of the grid but also for groups of pixels into homogeneous polygons, based on the slope criteria, orientation and slope length which can be adjusted by the user (Wall et al., 2002; Sadiki et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2008).The model combines empirical RUSLE factors affecting the extent of erosion and is as follows (Fig. 5): A = R.K.LS.C.P where: A = estimated average soil loss in (t/h/yr), K = soil erodibility factor, LS = topographic factor integrating gradient and slope length, C = Cover-management factor, P = Support practice factor. The RUSLE factors were calculated (in the form of raster layers) for our watershed in the basis of the soil and land use map (Fig. 5). The R-factor was calculated from monthly and annual precipitation data. The K-factor was estimated El Aroussi, Mesrar, El Garouani, Lahrach, Beaabidate, Akdim, Jabrane 10 using soil maps available from the Soil Geographical Data Base of Europe at a scale of 1:25,000. The LS-factor was calculated from a 25 m digital elevation model. The C-factor was calculated using image from Google Maps and field observations (Fig. 6). The P-factor in absence of data was set to 1. Fig. 5 RUSLE schematic approach used The RUSLE factors were calculated (in the form of raster layers) for our watershed in the basis of the soil and land use map (Fig. 5). The R-factor was calculated from monthly and annual precipitation data. The K-factor was estimated using soil maps available from the Soil Geographical Data Base of Europe at a scale of 1:25,000.

The P-factor in absence of data was set to 1. 3.2. Results. More than 90% of the total basin area of Oued El Mellah is covered by cereals, olives, or a mixture of both cultures, while other land (badland, irrigated agriculture, dump, and reforestation) represents only 7% of the basin area. The potential annual soil loss using the revised universal soil loss equation 11 Given the complexity and diversity of geological facies several soil types occurs in the region. There are eight soil units (raw minerals, little change erosion, little change colluvial input, Vertisol rounded surface, Calcimagnesic, Isohumic, Complex units 2 , 3, and 4, Complex units 3 and 16). Fig. 6 Soil units and land use Fig. 7 Soil K-Factor and C-Factor The K and C factors of each soil and land use unit are reported in the Table.1. The average soil losses determined by RUSLE vary between 5.6 t / ha / yr as the minimum value measured in the urban areas and 150.7 t / ha / yr as the maximum value recorded at the badland areas, which are generally unprotected Regosols located on steep slopes. The areas occupied by annual crops also show a high susceptibility to soil erosion, with annual losses of 41.6 t / ha / year (Tab. 2).

M. FERRY'}]","The Siluro-Devonian Waits River Formation of north-east Vermont was deformed, intruded by plutons and regionally metamorphosed during the Devonian Acadian Orogeny. Five metamorphic zones were mapped based on the mineralogy of carbonate rocks. From low to high grade, these are: (1) ankerite-albite, (2) ankerite-oligoclase, (3) biotite, (4) amphibole and (5) diopside zones. Pressure was near 4.5 kbar and temperature varied from c. 450-degrees-C in the ankerite-albite zone to c. 525-degrees-C in the diopside zone. Fluid composition for all metamorphic zones was estimated from mineral equilibria. Average calculated X(CO2)[= CO2/(CO2 + H2O)] of fluid in equilibrium with the marls increases with increasing grade from 0.05 in the ankerite-oligoclase zone. to 0.25 in the biotite zone and to 0.44 in the amphibole zone. In the diopside zone, X(CO2) decreases to 0.06. Model prograde metamorphic reactions were derived from measured modes, mineral chemistry, and whole-rock chemistry. Prograde reactions involved decarbonation with an evolved volatile mixture of X(CO2) > 0.50. The X(CO2) of fluid in equilibrium with rocks from all zones, however, was generally <0.40. This difference attests to the infiltration of a reactive H2O-rich fluid during metamorphism. Metamorphosed carbonate rocks from the formation suggests that both heat flow and pervasive infiltration of a reactive H2O-rich fluid drove mineral reactions during metamorphism. Average time-integrated volume fluxes (cm3 fluid/cm2 rock), calculated from the standard equation for coupled fluid flow and reaction in porous media, are ( 1) ankerite-oligoclase zone: c. 1 X 10(4); (2) biotite zone: c. 3 x 10(4); (3) amphibole zone: c. 10 X 10(4); and diopside zone: c. 60 X 10(4). The increase in calculated flux with increasing grade is at least in part the result of internal production of volatiles from prograde reactions in pelitic schists and metacarbonate rocks within the Waits River Formation. The mapped pattern of time-integrated fluxes indicates that the Strafford-Willoughby Arch and the numerous igneous intrusions in the field area focused fluid flow during metamorphism. Many rock specimens in the diopside zone experienced extreme alkali depletion and also record low X(CO2). Metamorphic fluids in equilibrium with diopside zone rocks may therefore represent a mixture of acid, H2O-rich fluids given off by the crystallizing magmas, and CO2-H2O fluids produced by devolatilization reactions in the host marls. Higher fluxes and different fluid compositions recorded near the plutons suggest that pluton-driven hydrothermal cells were local highs in the larger regional metamorphic hydrothermal system",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/56/A8/79/56A879D1F4FC0957EB39E1D5E870947F.pdf

Two positive excursions separated by a negative one are observed. The first positive excursion covers, in the Urgonian sequence, the lower member with rudists, which is consequently considered equivalent to the Lower Bedoulian limestones of La Bedoule (Tuarkyricus and Weissi zones). The negative excursion marks the base of the overlying bioclastic member, the upper part of which records the main positive excursion, centered on the Grandis zone, at La Bedoule. The hard-ground which caps the Urgonian sequence and the overlying marls correlate with the Furcata zone. Dating of the Urgonian sequences from Provence, at ammonite zone level, has significant relevant implications on the stratigraphic interpretation of time equivalent platform successions in SE France. The good quality of the isotope calibration between platform and basinal sequences has an important bearing on forthcoming correlations of functional aspects of the corresponding ecosystems.",,

A quantitative model for estimating the amount of transfer of carbonate developed by Ricken (1986) depends on differential compaction estimates inferred from varying degrees of burrow flattening in limestones and marls. However, a review of physical property and calcium carbonate data compiled by deep-sea drilling shows that a key assumption in Ricken's model is incorrect. Pelagic sediments exhibit large variations in initial porosity that depend negatively on carbonate content. Differential compaction in lithified sections is thus expected from primary porosity variations that follow carbonate content. Furthermore, no analogue to the diagenetic unmixing process has been observed in long deep-sea sections logged for density and porosity.",,

The aim was to distinguish between the volcanic and sedimentary processes that produced these deposits, to suggest a depositional model for volcaniclastic sedimentation in a shelf environment and to discuss the use of VLs for stratigraphic correlations. Two kinds of VLs have been distinguished: single volcaniclastic layers (SVLs) and multiple volcaniclastic layers (MVLs). SVLs are single beds of well sorted vitric siltites, mainly consisting of volcanic components and minor terrigenous and intrabasinal grains; the vitric fraction mainly consists of blocky fragments. They show a very low magnetic anisotropy degree and a prominent magnetic lineation. These VLs are interbedded in outer shelf marls and are interpreted as primary pyroclastic fall deposits. MVLs, which can be up to 10 m thick, show limited lateral continuity and are made up of several-decimetre-thick graded beds, separated by erosional surfaces and consisting of vitric arenites and siltites with about 15% non-volcanic components. Two kinds of MVLs have been distinguished: (1) Type 1 MVLs, interbedded in storm-dominated glaucony-rich calcarenites and showing rough, low-angle cross-stratification (hummocky cross stratification), water escape and load structures. These deposits are characterized by a slightly foliated magnetic fabric and are interpreted as storm layers, deposited between fairweather and storm wave base. (2) Type 2 MVLs are interbedded in outer shelf marls, and are characterized by parallel lamination and by a well developed magnetic foliation. They are interpreted as storm-induced, distal shelf turbidites, triggered by storm activity acting in the more internal part of the shelf. The Monferrato VLs resulted from explosive eruptions of volcanic edifices, located outside of the basin, that produced an extensive tuff blanket that was uniformly distributed on a carbonate-dominated shelf. Above storm wave base the VLs were immediately reworked by storm activity, and the resulting deposits are type 1 MVLs. Below storm wave base, primary pyroclastic fall deposits were preserved, corresponding to SVLs. Storm-induced turbidity currents gave rise to type 2 MVLs, that were deposited below storm wave base. Preservation of VLs in a shelf environment is hampered by the high-energy conditions of the shelf. Consequently, these deposits are characterized by a restricted lateral continuity and their use as correlation tools may be misleading.",,

Tectonic evolution progressed from a Triassic-Early jurassic (Liassic) continental rifting stage on the northern edge of the African craton, through an Early jurassic (Middle Liassic)-Late Cretaceous/Eocene oceanic rifting stage and passive margin formation, to a final continental collision and active margin deformation stage in the Late Cretaceous/Eocene to Holocene. This evolution occurred in a transtensional and transpressional framework resulting from the oblique separation and convergence of the African and European plates. Extensive shallow-water carbonate platform deposits covered large parts of the Periadriatic region in the Late Triassic. Platform breakup and development of a platform-to-basin carbonate shelf morphology began in the Late Triassic and extended through the Cretaceous. On the basis of this paleogeographic evolution, the regional geology of the Periadriatic region can be expressed in terms of three main Upper Triassic-Paleogene sedimentary sequences: the platform sequence (sequence ""A""), the platform to basin sequence (sequence ""B""), and the basin sequence (sequence ""C""). These sequences developed during the initial rifting and subsequent passive-margin formation tectonic stages. Three distinct episodes of source-bed deposition can be identified. Middle-Upper Triassic to Lower Jurassic (Liassic) organic-rich, oil-prone and mature source beds generally are structurally controlled, and are closely associated with transtensional intraplatform basins formed in the early continental rifting stage. The principal Triassic source basins and most of the surface hydrocarbon indications and economically important oil fields of the Periadriatic region are associated with sequence ""B"" areas. The second episode of organic-rich rocks deposition includes both shallow and deeper water facies of Jurassic-Cretaceous age. Thin, immature, deep-water epioceanic organic-rich marls and shales are generally bathymetrically controlled. These units are related to basin-wide anoxic events in the Tethys ocean and its submerged continental margin, and are associated with sequence ""B"" areas. Middle-Upper Cretaceous shallow-water, oil-prone facies occur in isolated anoxic basins within carbonate platforms; these source sequences are generally thicker and are associated with sequence ""A"" areas. No major hydrocarbon accumulation can be directly attributed to the Jurassic-Cretaceous epioceanic and intraplatform source rock sequences. The third episode of source bed deposition characterizes the final active margin deformation stage, and is represented by Upper Tertiary organic-rich terrigenous units, mostly gas prone. These are essentially associated with turbiditic and flysch sequences of fore-deep basins, and have generated the greater part of the commercial biogenic gases of the Periadriatic region.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/93/18/40/931840E3F0AB2CC475CED6A77CFBCA81.pdf
53e9ad82b7602d97037795ab,Deep-water stromatolites andFrutexites Maslov from the early and Middle Jurassic of S-Germany and Austria,,"[{'name': 'Florian Böhm'}, {'id': '53f36a6adabfae4b349a9ce0', 'name': 'Thomas C. Brachert'}]","Summary Despite extensive discussions during the last 20 years stromatolites are still used by many geologists as unequivocal indicators of very shallow-water conditions. We investigated four stratigraphic units from the Lower and Middle Jurassic of southern Germany (Posidonien-Schiefer, Amaltheen-Ton) and of the Northern Calcareous Alps (Adneter Kalk, Klauskalk), which were formerly interpreted as shallow marine sediments by some authors due to the occurrence of stromatolites. Our interpretations of the macro-, micro- and ultrafacies of these sediments are not compatible with shallow-water settings. We therefore propose a deep-marine, aphotic origin of these stromatolites. Former interpretations of the Posidonien-Schiefer as a shallow-water deposit are mainly based on the occurrence of stromatolites. We favour the model of a temporarily stagnant, deep, aphotic basin for these planktonrich sediments. Particles resembling ooids, but lying within mudstones cannot be taken as evidence for shallow agitated water. They either formed within the mud or are allochthonous. The deep-water setting of the red limestone of the Alpine Early and Middle Jurassic is indicated by a lack of platform-typical components like coated grains and phototrophic benthos and by shells of plankton and nekton forming a major part of the sediment. Stromatolites occur on the steep slope of a drowned Rhaetian reef with an estimated relief of 50–100 m and immediately below and within radiolarian limestones, deposited below the aragonite compensation depth (ACD). The aphotic stromatolites show some morphological differences to their shallow water counterparts. In all of our sections they occurred during intervals of reduced sedimentation. They form only thin horizons and probably grew very slowly. Mineralizations by Fe−Mn oxides and phosphate are very common. The presence of a microbial film is evident from binding of sedimentary particles, but the nature of the microbes is not known. Growth habits within the very distinct environments of red limestone and black shales show some common features, but also clear differences. The microproblematicumFrutexites Maslov is a very common component in deep-water stromatolites, but may also itself form small crusts or dendrolites. It occurs in two different forms. Opaque, slender forms with indistinct outlines probably grew within the weakly lithified sediment. Thicker, transparent forms with well defined outlines are found in cavities and probably also grew on the seafloor. Well preserved specimens display an internal fabric of radially arranged fibres of Fe−Mn oxides and calcite. It is suggested that calcite or aragonite were one original mineralogy ofFrutexites, which was later replaced by Fe−Mn oxides or phosphate. It is not certain whetherFrutexites is an organic, biomineralized structure or an inorganic mineralization, but the variable mineralogy and growth forms in different environments point to an organic origin. But even if organic, the occurrence in cryptic habitats and negative phototactic growth-directions make it clear thatFrutexites was not phototrophic.",,

The analysis shows that there is a consistent inclination error for the NRM component, which is removed between 500 and 600-degrees-C, which may be caused by compaction of the sediment. Differences in inclination error throughout the composite section are related to differing carbonate content, a higher carbonate content implying less compaction and smaller inclination error. Furthermore, consistent differences are found between directions of normal and reversed polarities as well as between directions of the lower and upper part of the composite section. These differences are to a large extent related to differences in carbonate content, porosity and influence of weathering. The Caltanissetta basin shows a total clockwise rotation of 34-degrees occurring since the early Pliocene. The magnetostratigraphy of the Rossello composite section shows that from the Miocene/Pliocene boundary (5.2 Ma) up to the Gilbert/Gauss boundary (3.6 Ma) there were no tectonic rotations of the Caltanissetta basin. Further, we speculate that 10-degrees of this total clockwise rotation occurred during approximately Kaena times (ca. 3.05 Ma), and that at least 24-degrees of this clockwise rotation is younger than the Gauss/Matuyama boundary (2.6 Ma).",,

""That way, you enjoy the ride up, avoid most of the declines, and don't get chewed up by sales commissions on frequent trades,"" he explains . Setting up your own chart takes a little initial investment of time and effort, but once it is constructed, maintaining it requires only a few minutes each week . Add the Friday closes of the index you choose for the past 53 weeks (for the Dow Jones industrials the total as of last Friday was 155,557 ) and divide by 53 to get the average (2992 for the Dow) .

The magnetostratigraphy from the Monte Singa sequence ranges from below the Gauss/Matuyama boundary up to and including the lower Olduvai boundary. Normal polarities at a level corresponding to isotope stage 81 most probably represent the Reunion subchron. From the lower Olduvai boundary upward, a reliable magnetostratigraphy could not be established due to increased weathering of the marls, resulting in mainly secondary magnetizations. The magnetostratigraphy from the composite sequence of the Crotone area belongs to a large part of the Matuyama Chron and includes the Olduvai subchron. The position of the lower and upper boundaries of the Olduvai subzone could be established more precisely than from earlier results. Moreover, the upper boundary of the Olduvai subzone poses an ambiguity: a relatively long normal polarity interval representing the main Olduvai subchron and corresponding to a duration of 115 ka is followed by a short (30 ka) reversed subchron and the short (15 ka) normal Vrica subchron. Another option, and more in accordance with the duration of the Olduvai subchron in literature, would be to consider the complete N-R-N polarity succession with a total duration of 160 ka as representing the Olduvai subchron, implying that this Olduvai subchron has a short reversed interval in its upper part. Linear interpolation and extrapolation yield ages for the most important late Pliocene-early Pleistocene biostratigraphic datum levels. An age of 1.69 Ma is found for the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary, using the conventional polarity time scale dated with radiometric results. However Hilgen [1], in correlating the sapropel groups and patterns to the precession curve of the Earth's orbit, obtained significantly different ages for the polarity transitions of the present study. According to this astronomically calibrated polarity time scale, the age of the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary is 1.81 Ma.",,

The study area (72oN, 33o50’E and 72o30’N, 33o25’E) needs more concentration during Recent to Eocene time with regard to the structural changes seems to occur within different part of the region. The author tried to study the geological and geophysical results in general after the Indo-Eurasian collision during Paleogene time with stable Asia rotational wrenching that formed after the southwards lesser force vector from Tadjik Basin (east of Tibet) area controversial to northwards directed more vector forced Indian continent but especial emphasis has been made on the E-W structural trend with tight anticlines and wider synclines in the East of Kohat while even tight synclines in the western most part of Kohat Plateau. The collision also resulted in the west of Plate (the Pakistan territory), an N-S oriented series of deep seated left-lateral basement-effected faulting ranges while the east of Plate (the Indian Territory) contained E-W oriented right lateral Dauki and Haflong faulting system. A number of evidences for confirming the continued tectonics appeared during the study also with higher rate of earthquakes in the area. The author like other scientists have observed that detachments are present in Eocene formation indicates the compressional structure that gave risen to thrust faults, overturned folds. Such transpressional picture has been marked clearly in Kalabagh Fault area also. The Kohat-Potwar plateau on the southern part of Himalayan and Karakoram orogenic belt is a result of compressional tectonics after Indo-Eurasian collision. The Kohat-Potwar plateau is bounded at north by Kalachitta Hills. The Salt Range and Trans-Indus Range marks the boundary at south. The western boundary is mark by Kurram-Parachinar Range. The River Indus separates the Kohat-Potwar Plateau by the Eastern side named as Potwar area and the Western side as Kohat area. The study is based on selected five drilled-well data while Khushalgarh area maps, published literatures and field surveys and studies provided the authentic conclusion for the new structural setting. The unconformities predictions and stratigraphic chart helped to understand the geology and key to sequences and seismic stratigraphical study also. Three large scale unconformities have been marked; 1Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, 2Cretaceous-Paleocene, in Cretaceous the area emerged out of sea that was followed by erosion. The emergence was more intense south and east of the area witnessed by the absence of the Cretaceous section, and 3Eocene-Miocene unconformities, Non-orogenic movements mainly caused by various cycles of uplift affecting pre-Eocene deposition. During the late Eocene, the area emerged out completely while the seawater withdraws from the area. The geologic structural feature is difficult to tie with surrounded areas even after the seismic study. The most significant feature of the area is the correct geological division, and exact marking of the location. The geology of the area is different as compared to southern Potwar and westernmost Kohat Basin. The Kohat portion of upper Indus Basin is similar to Potwar area BUT the regional stratigraphy made difference between these two large basins. Both the basins have gone through Great Explorations – Canada and Beyond 1 similar evolutionary history. The Potwar Plateau has subdued relief compared to Kohat Plateau having down-plunge geographic extension of Kohat Plateau. The 2D seismic data interpretation is based on the seismic attributes, seismic configuration, seismic attributes and seismic pattern. The seismic data collected from both east and west part of the study area but western seismic section from western side has been shown for critical study due to importance o of rotational damages. The seismic reflection configuration is oblique-sigmoid type that indicated high-dip to moderate dip bedding pattern which in turn shows high energy to low energy depositional process. It has been marked in the seismic section that short pop-up structures have weak reflectors beyond 3 seconds. The increase of amplitudes between 2-3 seconds in the section suggests the possibilities of fractures or/and gas filled fractures and the dimming/weakening of amplitude refer has been difficult to analyze. In the central Kohat Plateau area, Tolanj anticlinorium have a flower structure. On this structure AMOCO had drilled a well in 80’s. Although the westernmost part of the Plateau have number of fractures but identification of hydrocarbons at OGDC drilled well Chanda Deep at about 5100m (5,500bbl/13.37mcf) and MOL drilled in Tal Block, both have opened up the vast terrain of Kohat Plateau as highly prospective attraction. The seismic sections in the western part of study area shown a few diffractions also. A large number of low mountain ridges have noticed in the studied area confirming the presence of Eocene detachments having continuous sequences of shale in Middle Eocene. And thus, large numbers of duplex structure also have been marked in the area. The Kohat and Kuldana Formations are the only representatives of the Middle Eocene in the Kohat Plateau. Relative to Potwar, the Salt-Range facies in Kohat area are more basin-ward and affected by the Early to Middle Eocene during the early stages of the Himalaya orogeny. The surface outcrops and subsurface conclusive interpretation study revealed the infrastructure of the area. The geological study showed that the region is Salt-effected based thinskinned and Basement-effected based, detachment formed thick-skinned with weak/broken upper ductile multi-fractured Incompetent Package (Miocene age) with detachment line and with the strong lower viscous table Competent Package (Eocene age). The upper zone above Eocene Incompetent package is more damaged as compared to the lower zone below Eocene Competent package. The north and northwestern area of Kohat have more tight and deformed structures as compared to the south and southeastern areas due to rotational activity. The whole Kohat region like Potwar is composed of imbricate wrench faults and these imbricate faults are gentle in the Potwar area while steeper in the Kohat area. The eastern part of the Kohat Plateau formed duplex structure in Kohat Formation. The western part of the area has more tectonic damages as compare to east part of Kohat region. Middle Eocene is better developed in Kohat Plateau. The northern areas of Pakistan mostly contain thin wedged shale of about 50-150 m thick deposits of Kuldana Formation from presumably Late Eocene while probably Middle Eocene age. In some northwestern of Kohat Plateau areas, this formation found as outcrop in isoclinals folded form sometime parallel to MBT (Main Boundary Thrust). The Lower Eocene (Chorgali Formation) is active but damaged more in western part of Kohat area, which also proves the rotational direction of the continent towards northwest from southeast and also the steep dips and throws of wrench faulting system in the area supports the statement. The main best source rock for the oil/gas accumulation available in the study area is Patala Formation and also Kuldana Formation. In Hazara District, the Kuldana Formation consists of multi-cored Marls, Calcareous conglomerates and red Sandstone is also common. In Kalachitta and northern Potwar, it consists of greenish grey to brown silty gypsiferious shale. In Kohat, this formation is composed principally of brownish red calcareous, silty clays with thin beds of sandstone near the top. It is exposed in the southern Hazara and northern Rawalpindi areas extending through northern Potwar and Kalachitta to Kohat area. It reaches about 150 meter (500ft) in Hazara and northern Potwar. The presence of fauna gastropods, fresh water bivalves and other fossils indicates that the formation was deposited in a transitional environment with probably more marine fresh water influence. In the Potwar, Kalachitta and Hazara areas, it overlies about 66 meter whereas in Kohat area conformably underlain by the Jatta Gypsum. In most areas, it is firmly overlain by the Middle Eocene Kohat Formation except in southern Hazara and Kalachitta where the Early Miocene Murree Formation unconformably overlies the Kuldana. Based on stratigraphical evidences the age is interpreted to range from Early Eocene to Early Middle Eocene. The Kohat formation is consisting of light grey to cream colored massive to nodular Limestone with marl and also green shale. In some areas, this formation may appear as “Reservoir Rock”. The Kohat Formation was found with three members, namely; 1Kaladhand Limestone Member: The basal member, which consists of light grey, hard, dense thinbedded limestone with thin shale beds especially in the lower part. This unit becomes more massive from east to west, 2Sadkal Shale Member: The middle unit consists of greenish grey calcareous shale and light grey limestone with Great Explorations – Canada and Beyond 2 abundant Foraminifera (Nummulites). It is mostly found in the northwestern Kohat area where shale nature is well developed and 3Habib Rahi Sandstone Member: The upper member is composed cream colored, hard, dense, thick bedded to massive limestone that is fractured and bracciated in the top few meters. The formation is restricted to Kohat, northern Potwar and Kalachitta upto180 meter (590ft) of thickness. A rather shallow marine environment due to little continental influence has been marked in the area. In the western part of area the drilled Kahi-1 well have Panoba Shale (Eocene) exposed. The well was drilled unto Jurassic formation. In the eastern of Kahi-1, Sumari-1 was drilled where thickness of Pa",,

The lower unit shows a disseminated synsedimentary or early diagenetic mineralization of sphalerite within Maastrichtian white limestones together with typical evaporitic celestite deposited in detrital beds of Upper Palaeocene to Lutetian age. This unit is interpreted as a normal sequence overturned during the Tertiary folding. The core of the Bou Khil mine anticline is well dated by lower Maastrichtian marls but not by Palaeocene, as it was previously proposed. This observation argues against an antiformal syncline interpretation. The Bou Khil overthrust can represent the tectonic superimposition of two different neighbouring halokinetic structures, possibly related to the emergence of the frontal ""Teboursouk decollement"".

The deposits on the northeastern side of this depression are preserved in the autochthonous Mesozoic cover of the Variscan Mouthoumet Massif, but also in the parautochthonous or allochthonous tectonic units that fringe to the north (Camps - Peyrepertuse slice, fig. 2) the North Pyrenean frontal thrust. From the Middle Cenomanian to the Lower Santonian included (96 to 85 Ma ago), the sedimentation in the Mouthoumet Massif indicates shallow marine carbonate or mixed (carbonate to terrigenous) conditions. The different facies depend mainly on two parameters : the variations of the accommodation space for sedimentation and the location of the numerous rudist buildups. The deposits are first organized in a homoclinal ramp until the Turonian. From the Coniacian up to the early Santonian, drowned platform patterns prevail. During the late Santonian and more precisely around 85 Ma with an other event around 84 Ma, the Mouthoumet Massif and its cover broke up under tectonic stresses. Positive and negative topographies reactivate the Variscan fault system. Platform - slope/basin morphologies substituted the preceeding ramp and drowned platform morphology. Looking to the south and in the direction N120 degrees E, the distal slope received gravitational and turbiditic sediments called the Gres de Labastide (fig. 7). The sediment supply shifted from north to south and from cast to west. To the north of this slope, the platform itself broke LIP into a mosaic of rhomboedric blocks, leading, to a graben and horst morphology. Those units are clearly different according to the character of their sedimentary facies. deltaic or reefal (Montagne des Cornes, Calcaires de Camps - Peyrepertuse). The detailed stratigraphic and sedimentologic studies of some of these systems reveal a tectono-sedimentary evolution involving two successive cycles Ss I (lower Upper Santonian) and Ss2 (Uppermost Santonian). In the western part of the Mouthoumet Massif this cyclic evolution is recorded from south to north, on the Parahou slope. the Rennes-les-Bains graben and the Bugarach horst. The lower cycle Ss1, located on the Rennes-les-Bains graben. is approximatively 85 Ma to 84 Ma in age. It starts with reworked deposits (lowstand systems tract) made up of sometimes several m elements derived from former sedimentary deposits (from TUronian up to Lower Santonian) even when the same deposits are in place on the adjacent horsts (e.g. the eastern horst of Bugarach). Those reworked deposits fill the bottom of the graben, principally in the transit zones (debris-flows of the Conglomerat de la Ferri re), or in the Parahou slope (slumps and debris-flows of the Cascade des Mathieux); then the deltaic complex of Rennes-les-Bains covers the older chaotic deposits; the blue marls and the overlying sandy facies (transgressive and highstand systems tracts) related to prodelta and deltafront deposits represent the infilling of the Rennes-les Bains graben. The upper cycle Ss2 developed probably between 84 Ma to 83,5 Ma; its geographical extension overlaps the limits of the lower cycle (e.g. the Bugarach horst), but its sedimentary organisation is still the same including: on the Parahou slope debris-flow and intrabasinal reworking (Conglomerat des Gaseous: lowstand systems tract); on the northern platform transgressive and highstand systems tracts, present in the Montague des Comes delta where the Marries bleues de Sougraigne represent the prodelta deposits, and the terrigenous and rudist buildups of the delta front deposits (fig. 7). The final infilling results from the spreading from NE to SW, of the (estuarine ? to) fluvial deposits of the Gres d'Alet Formation at around 83 Ma. In the eastern part of the Mouthoumet Massif, sedimentary development is punctuated by tectonic events. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify in some outcrops the main elements of the two tectono-sedimentary cycles. - The cycle Ss1 is partly preserved in the genetic sequence which links the Calcaires de Camps-Peyrepertuse (shelf margin wedge systems tract) and the Marnes du Pla de Sagnes (transgressive systems tract). The cycle Ss2 is only known through different facies of the Gres de Labastide Formation: reworked deposits on the slope; coarse-grained silicoclastic deposits on the transit zones. - In the cycle Ss1 differences appear between the western and the eastern parts of the Mouthoumet massif. When in the western area deltaic conditions prevailed, in the eastern area a shallow carbonate and buildup facies developed. Such differences disappear in the cycle Ss2 by the general establishment of fore slope deltaic deposits. The geodynamic reconstruction resulting from plate kinematics indicates a major change between the early Coniacian (89 Ma) and the Middle Campanian (79 Ma), when the sinistral/divergent motion of Iberia with respect to stable Europe turned to a dextral/convergent movement. The tectono-sedimentary events presented here took place during this period (85 Ma to 83 Ma). The tectono-sedimentary evolution of the subpyrenean trough and the shift of the European and Iberian plates are thought to be intimately linked. The new chronological and geodynamical data proposed herein show that the genesis and the evolution of the subpyrenean sedimentary processes related to the northern Aquitanian margin of the Subpyrenean trough allow to draw some basic conclusions: - the opening of the Subpyrenean trough occurred in two steps, the first around 85 Ma and the second around 84 Ma; - this caused a change in the sedimentary setting with platform environments replacing the earlier ramp geometry; - the Subpyrenean trough formed and evolved under transtensive tectonic conditions; - during the late Santonian two tectono-eustatic sequences marked the former stages of the eastward opening and infilling of this basin; - the diachronous infilling which began here around 83,5 Ma prograded to the western Plantaurel and Petites-Pyrenees area; - no significant northward shifting of the depositional-axis of the Senonian basins occurred; - only a gradual westward shift of the depositional centers, along the subpyrenean direction of the slope area (N110 degrees E to N130 degrees E) was noticed.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/E7/B5/F7/E7B5F7C866BCE44DB34785C3BAE09752.pdf

These concretions, which grew on heterogeneities in the sediment, are arranged as horizons parallel to the bedding, and are often associated with carbonate and phosphate nodules. Detailed sedimentological and stratigraphical observations suggest that they represent the consequence of short-term pauses in sedimentation during early diagenesis, but the most important occurrences of barite are below prominent discontinuities. This may be explained by the frequency of pauses in sedimentation caused by a progressive starvation, or an increase in the energy of bottom-water currents. The high number of barite occurrences on the basin margins is directly linked to the recurrence of sedimentary breaks. The geochemical data show that the host sediment corresponds to a pelagic setting, far from hydrothermal influences, but generally in a restricted, dysoxic to suboxic, depositional environment. The sulphur isotopic composition of the barite sulphate (+16 to +76‰ rel. CDT) supports the hypothesis of an early diagenetic origin of the barite nodules. Their genesis may be explained by the fixation of a diagenetic front corresponding to the penetration of a sulphate reduction zone from the seawater–sediment interface down in the sediment which is in contact with barium-rich porewaters expelled upwards as a consequence of compaction. The barium of biogenic origin, initially stored in the underlying black shale, was mobilized under strongly reducing conditions. Such fixation is normally induced by a pause or a stop in sedimentation due to starvation or renewed bottom-water circulation. Together with other concretions, the barite nodules mark condensed stratigraphic intervals and often represent major breaks. As such they shed light on variations in sedimentary activity and their importance in the sedimentology and stratigraphy of pelagic marly sequences cannot be ignored.",,

The sediment waves occur on the lower continental rise and display wavelengths of up to 1 km and wave heights of up to 6 m. Wave sediments consist of interbedded turbidites and pelagic/hemipelagic marls and oozes. Nannofossil-based dating of the sediments indicates a bulk sedimentation rate of 2·4 cm 1000 years-1, and the waves are migrating upslope at a rate of 0·28 m 1000 years-1. Sediment provenance studies reveal that the turbidity currents maintaining the waves are largely sourced from volcanic islands to the south. Investigation of existing models for sediment-wave formation leads to the conclusion that the Selvage sediment waves form as giant antidunes. Simple numerical modelling reveals that turbidity currents crossing the wave field have internal Froude numbers of 0·5-1·9, which is very close to the antidune existence limits. Depositional flow velocities range from <6 to 125 cm-1. There is a rapid increase in wavelength and flow thickness in the upper 10 km of the wave field, which is unexpected, as the slope angle remains relatively constant. This anomaly is possibly linked to a topographic obstacle just upslope of the sediment waves. Flows passing over the obstacle may undergo a hydraulic jump at its boundary, leading to an increase in flow thickness. In the lower 15 km of the wave field, flow thickness decreases downslope by 60%, which is comparable with results obtained for other unconfined turbidity currents undergoing flow expansion",,

Benson'}],"The Pollack Farm Site near Cheswold, Delaware, is named for a borrow pit excavated during highway construction. The excavation exposed a portion of the Cheswold sands of the lower Miocene Calvert Formation. Two sand intervals (Cheswold C-3 and C-4) yielded a diverse assemblage of land and marine vertebrate remains and more than 100 species of mollusks. An isolated occurrence of a sandy silt (the radiolarian bed) stratigraphically between the two macrofossil-bearing units yielded only siliceous microfossils—radiolarians, diatoms, and sponge spicules. Radiolarians from the radiolarian bed identify the Stichocorys wolffii Zone, which has an age estimated between 17.3 and 19.2 Ma. This is compatible with the strontium-isotope age estimate of 17.9±0.5 Ma on mollusks from the lower shelly sand bed (Cheswold C-3 sand) at the site. Both age determinations are compatible with the early Hemingfordian North American Land Mammal Age that was assigned to the land mammal fossils recovered from the C-3 sand. The lower Miocene diatom Actinoptychus heliopelta from the radiolarian bed identifies East Coast Diatom Zone (ECDZ) 1. This taxon also occurs within “Bed 3A” of the Calvert Formation, the older part of the highly diatomaceous silty clays of Bed 3 that crop out in the Coastal Plain of Maryland and Virginia. Correlation of borehole geophysical logs between Delaware and New Jersey places the vertebrate and molluscan assemblages collected from outcrops of the Shiloh marl of the lower Kirkwood Formation of New Jersey stratigraphically below those from the Pollack Farm Site. Estimates between about 19 and 20 Ma are calculated from a published Sr-isotope ratio for one mollusk shell from the Shiloh site. This indicates a possible unconformity between the Shiloh-equivalent beds (Cheswold C-2 sand, not exposed) and the ~18-Ma lower shell bed (Cheswold C-3 sand) at the Pollack Farm Site. The vertebrate assemblage from the Pollack Farm Site is of early Hemingfordian age, but vertebrates from the Shiloh site are not age-diagnostic. Both assemblages occur about 150–200 feet above the base of the Miocene section. The Farmingdale vertebrate fossils of the northeastern Coastal Plain of New Jersey occur just above the base of the Miocene section (Kirkwood Formation) with an estimated age of 20.5–22.6 Ma based on published strontium-isotope data from boreholes in the vicinity. This age is compatible with the revised interpretation of late Arikareean for the age of the Farmingdale land mammal fossils. The Popes Creek vertebrate assemblage of Maryland is from beds nearly stratigraphically equivalent to the Pollack Farm Site exposures, which agrees with the close temporal correlation of vertebrate remains from both sites. The Barstovian-age vertebrate assemblages from the Calvert Formation and basal part of the overlying Choptank Formation at the Calvert Cliffs exposures of Maryland are from units equivalent to the early middle Miocene Dorcadospyris alata Radiolarian Zone. Radiolarian criteria that are used to indicate the degree of neritic versus oceanic conditions for the Miocene of the middle Atlantic Coastal Plain show increased neritic influence for the Pollack Farm Site and nearby exposures of beds of the S. wolffii Zone in Delaware, as compared with the more oceanic influence interpreted for other occurrences of the zone to the south and west in Maryland. This is consistent with the regional deltaic influence indicated for Delaware and New Jersey during the early Miocene and with the shallow inner neritic to intertidal paleoenvironments interpreted by other contributors to this volume for the Pollack Farm Site. 1 In Benson.

Data were explored with the aim of identifying any diagnostic geochemical relationships between site EC, pH, sediment size and SAR, which might constitute typical ‘signatures’ for site materials, with some success. Data for the three sites are further used to explore the hypothesis that changes in site geochemistry through time are involved in badland stabilisation. It was found that: (1) the physico-chemical properties of the three sites can be differentiated by the functional relationship between EC and SAR, and this may represent a useful tool in characterising sites where piping predominates; (2) there is some (equivocal) evidence that sediment size distribution may play an additional role in site diagnosis and evolution; and (3) surfaces appear to lose sodium over time, the suggestion being that sodium is either progressively buffered by calcium during leaching, or exchanges with hydrogen on the cation exchange sites under a vegetation cover. Since other research suggests that smectite can also relocate down the profile on some marl sites, reducing hydraulic conductivity and suppressing pipes, we argue that the surface at Tabernas may be capable of long-term autostabilisation in which piping intensity progressively reduces. However, this possibility really applies only to fine-grained, densely structured materials, and evidence from the silty Triassic-rich unit in the Mocatan basin suggests that without a high clay content, piping may be expected to increase through time. From this standpoint, contemporary badland morphology at Mocatan does not represent an early stage of the forms seen in Vera and Tabernas.",,

GBV-C was associated with reduced hepatic fibrosis ( p = 0.005) and inflammation ( p = 0.007). The microarray analysis of the liver samples ( n = 10) showed the down-regulation of genes critical to intra-hepatic T-cell signaling associated with GBV-C. Quantitative RT-PCR of the liver samples ( n = 13) confirmed the down-regulation of lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) ( p = 0.02) and docking protein 2 (DOK2) ( p = 0.04). No differences in the expression levels of these genes were observed in PBMCs ( n = 22) according to the GBV-C status. The hepatic expression of the LCK protein, measured by immunohistochemistry ( n = 36), was decreased in CD3-positive T-cells within portal tracts associated with GBV-C ( p = 0.003). This remained significant in multivariate analysis controlling for hepatic fibrosis and inflammation ( p = 0.027). No differences were observed in plasma cytokine concentrations ( n = 25) or ex-vivo peripheral T-cell responses ( n = 13) versus GBV-C status. Conclusions GBV-C infection is associated with down-regulation of critical genes involved in intra-hepatic T-cell signaling in HCV/HIV co-infection. This may be relevant to the pathogenesis of reduced HCV-related liver disease in HIV co-infection.

It replicates in mononuclear cells, including CD4 positive T-cells [3] and is transmitted sexually and percutaneously similar to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is frequently found in populations at risk for blood-borne or sexually transmitted viruses [2] . Studies performed in HIV infected individuals have suggested that the presence of GBV-C is associated with an improved morbidity and reduced mortality with slower progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [4–6] . Liver disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients co-infected with HCV and HIV in the highly active anti-retroviral treatment (HAART) era [7] . Limited information exists on viral and host factors that affect the rate of HCV disease progression in HCV/HIV co-infection. We have previously shown that GBV-C viraemia (i.e. GBV-C RNA positive) is associated with significantly less compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, and an improvement in cirrhosis-free survival in HCV/HIV co-infected subjects [8] . This raises questions as to how GBV-C might influence HCV-related liver disease, and what role HIV infection plays in this interaction [7] . T-cells are thought to be an important mediator of liver injury in HCV mono-infection [9] while CD4 immunosuppression plays a role in liver disease progression in HCV/HIV co-infection [8,10] . Studies have suggested that GBV-C exerts a favorable influence on HIV/AIDS related outcomes by affecting T-cell function, although the exact mechanism remains obscure [2] . The aim of this study was to identify differential gene and protein expression associated with GBV-C infection which may be associated with a reduction in HCV-related liver disease in the setting of HIV co-infection. No study has yet addressed the effect of GBV-C infection on intra-hepatic gene expression. We provide evidence that GBV-C RNA is associated with significant down-regulation of a number of genes that play a critical role in intra-hepatic T-cell signaling. These findings could have significance in the pathogenesis of HCV-related liver disease in HIV co-infection. Patients and methods Study population and design The study was approved by the Ethics Committee. After obtaining informed consent patients, with HCV/HIV co-infection being evaluated for Interferon (IFN)-based therapy for HCV, were recruited from January 2000 until August 2007. Twenty-seven patients were prospectively recruited in a consecutive manner from outpatient attendance. Specimens collected included liver tissue, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and plasma. To achieve timely recruitment of sufficient numbers, a further 16 demographically matched patients with archival paraffin embedded liver tissue were retrospectively identified randomly from our earlier study group [8] . Clinical and laboratory data were collected at the time of liver biopsy or venesection. Plasma tested positive for HCV and HIV on multiple occasions, as previously outlined [8] . Exclusions included IFN-based therapies as these can clear GBV-C RNA [2] , hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (HBsAg and/or HBV DNA positive), alcohol consumption (>40 g or 4 standard drinks/day) and/or alcoholic liver disease, non alcoholic fatty liver disease, abnormal liver function due to anti-retroviral therapy or other drugs, and CD4 count <200 μl or AIDS at enrollment. Decompensated cirrhosis, coagulopathy, and significant immunosuppression were excluded due to risks in obtaining the liver tissue and likelihood of confounding factors. Cirrhosis was defined by clinical and radiological means in the absence of a liver biopsy, as described [8] . Clinical specimens, GBV-C detection and liver/PBMC RNA isolation Viral nucleic acid was extracted from plasma using the MagNA pure LC instrument and Total Nucleic Acid isolation kit (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) and the amplification was performed using SuperScript III One-Step Reverse Transcription (RT) PCR system with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA). Active GBV-C viraemia, as defined by the presence of GBV-C RNA, was detected as previously described [11] using primers for the non-structural gene NS5B . The sensitivity of the GBV-C RNA assay was estimated to be 10 5 RNA copies/ml based on comparisons to similar in-house RT-PCR assays [8] . Ultrasound guided liver biopsy was performed with two cores of tissue. One core was used for histological analysis. The second core was used for RNA isolation, placed in RNA stabilization solution RNALater (Ambion, Inc., Austin, Texas, USA), and stored at −20 °C. PBMCs were isolated using a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden), and cryopreserved in fetal calf serum (FCS) plus 10% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Prior to RNA extraction from PBMCs, DMSO was washed away with minimum essential medium (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted from the liver or PBMCs using RNAeasy MiniKit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) using a protocol for isolation of total RNA from animal cells. The RNA was stored at −70 °C until required. Microarray and pathway analysis Five to 15 μg of total liver RNA was obtained from 10 patients. RNA was labeled and hybridized to the Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA) [12] . Scanned images were examined for quality control metrics including average background, percent called present, and scaling factor. Only those samples falling within recommended ranges for metrics were used. A custom CDF file (version 8) was obtained from the microarray laboratory (University of Michigan) and used to generate probe sets for analysis [13] . As gene expression changes may be diminished in low abundance cell types, in mixed tissues samples such as the liver, a pathway analysis was used to identify molecular networks of co-regulated genes within differentially expressed probe sets (filtered on p values <0.01 and fold changes >1.2). This list was imported into the Pathway Studio (Ariadne Genomics Inc., Rockville, USA) and interactions between the genes or their protein products were examined using the October 2008 update of the ResNet database (Ariadne Genomics). Microarray data in this publication have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [14] and is accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE16593 ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE16593 ). Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) Selected microarray results were confirmed in 13 liver biopsies and PBMCs from 22 patients. The cDNA was synthesized from 0.5–1 μg of total RNA using random hexamers. TaqMan Real-time PCR was performed using the Assays-On-Demand Gene Expression Products (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Probes used with associated ABI assay numbers were: for RPLP0 (Hs99999902_m1), lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase ( LCK ) (Hs00178427_m1), docking protein 2 ( DOK2 ) (Hs00182758_m1) and CD3 delta subunit ( CD3δ of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex (Hs00174158_m1). Relative amounts of PCR product were determined using the comparative cycle threshold ( Ct ) method, where the amount of target DNA was normalized to the internal control, RPLP0 ribosomal cDNA, and expressed relative to the baseline normal control cDNA (2 −ΔΔ Ct ). The liver and PBMCs were standardized to the same GBV-C RNA negative sample. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitation of LCK density This assay was performed on 36 patients, including 16 retrospectively identified. Paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed liver was examined using the Novocastra Novolink Max Polymer system (RE7260-K) with prior antigen retrieval. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against LCK (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) at 1/100 dilution and a mouse monoclonal antibody against CD3 (Novocastra, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK) at a 1/100 dilution were the primary antibodies. LCK and CD3 staining were examined at 200× magnification using a BX51 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with images captured digitally (Spot, SciTech, Victoria, Australia). Sampling fields were artifact-free with consecutive sections used with the same field selected based on the presence of portal tracts or central veins. LCK and CD3 density in the liver were determined by measuring the proportional area of immunoreactivity in up to 10 randomly selected, non-overlapping, 80 μm × 160 μm sampling fields using imaging analysis software (Analytical Imaging Station version 6.0, Imaging Research, St. Catherines, Canada). Histological assessment was performed by one pathologist (CAM) blinded to results and GBV-C status. To correct for the density of immunoreactivity of LCK due to different numbers of parenchymal and portal tract T-cells within sections, LCK protein expression was reported as a ratio of CD3 protein expression, a common pan-T-cell marker. Cytometric bead assay (CBA) and enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) Cytokine profiling was performed on 25 plasma specimens using Cytometric Bead Array Flex Sets (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Cytokines represented Th-1, Th-2, and T-cell/macrophage responses: Interleukins (IL) 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12-p70, 13, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). HIV and HCV-specific T-cell responses in PBMCs from 13 patients using IFN-γ and IL-10 enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays (Mabtech, Sweden) were performed. T-cell responses were assessed using overlapping peptides pools (NIH AIDS Reagent Reference Program). HCV-specific T-cell responses were measured using peptides of 18 amino acids, with 10 amino acid overlap, spanning the entire HCV polyprotein. HIV-specific T-cell responses were measured using peptides of 15 amino acids, with 11 amino acid overlap comprising Gag, Polymerase 1, Polymerase 2, envelope, VIF, VPR, Nef, REV, Tat, and VPR proteins. PBMCs were cultured in duplicate wells at 2 × 10 5 /well in RPMI (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS with 1 μg/ml final concentration of peptide pool in pre-coated ELISPOT plates and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Positive control antigens were IL-2 (10 U/ml), anti-CD3 antibody (0.05 μg/ml), phytohemaglutinin (PHA) (5 μg/ml), and a peptide pool containing CMV, EBV, and influenza CD8 positive T-cell epitopes (CEF) (1 μg/ml) (Mabtech). PBMCs without antigen stimulation were used as negative controls. The number of spot forming cells (SFC) was analyzed using an ELISPOT plate reader (AID GmbH) and calculated by subtracting the mean number of spots in negative control duplicates from the mean number of spots in test duplicates, then normalized to SFC/10 6 PBMCs. The limit of detection for the assays was <25 SFC/10 6 PBMCs. Statistical analysis For microarray (hypothesis generation), robust multi-array average analysis, with default quantile normalization, was used to generate expression values [15] . Differential expression of microarray probe sets between GBV-C RNA negative and positive samples was determined using one-way ANOVA. No microarray probe sets passed a false discovery rate of 0.1, however, probe sets exhibiting differential expression with p values <0.01 and fold changes >1.2 were identified. Microarray expression analysis was performed using the software application Partek Genomics Suite software (Partek, St. Louis, MO, USA). For demographic characteristics, univariate analysis was conducted using chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests as appropriate. Univariate nonparametric analyzes of study-related outcomes were performed using the Mann–Whitney rank sum test, unless otherwise stated. Multivariate logistic regression was used to confirm differences in IHC results by GBV-C status when controlling for stage of fibrosis and grade of inflammation. For all non-microarray analyzes (hypothesis testing) a probability level of p <0.05 was used for statistical significance. This analysis was performed using SigmaStat for Windows version 3.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Results Forty-three patients, all male of Caucasian origin, were included and GBV-C RNA was detected in 16 of them (37.2%). Demographic characteristics of patients were similar ( Table 1 ). Minimum duration of known HCV or HIV infection was similar between GBV-C RNA positive and negative groups, however, the minimum duration of known HIV infection was longer than HCV infection, as reliable testing for HCV had only became widely available in Australia since 1991. HIV testing has been available since 1985. No significant HCV genotype differences between groups were seen with genotype 1 found in 28 out of 42 patients tested (66.7%) ( Table 1 ) and no significant differences were seen between groups for HCV viral load or ALT levels. Based on Scheuer classification, cirrhosis was detected in 8 out of 37 (21.6%) patients. Two out of 16 (14.4%) had cirrhosis in the GBV-C RNA positive group. There was significantly less advanced hepatic fibrosis ( p = 0.005) and inflammation ( p = 0.007) associated with the presence of GBV-C RNA. Based on a CD4 nadir, recorded at a time prior to enrollment, being greater than or less than 200/μl, no differences with regard to hepatic fibrosis ( p = 0.254) or inflammation ( p = 0.633) were seen. Furthermore, there were no differences for CD4 counts, HIV viral load, or use of HAART. Microarray expression analysis of the liver RNA comparing 4 GBV-C RNA positive patients versus 6 RNA negative patients was performed. 108 probe sets were identified as differentially regulated between the two groups with a p value less than 0.01. Twenty-five of these probe sets (each corresponding to a unique gene) had a fold change of 1.2 or greater ( Table 2 ). Pathway analysis identified interacting molecular networks between these genes. Six out of 25 (24%) of these genes: LCK , DOK2 , CD3δ, phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid microdomains 1 ( PAG ), interleukin 2 receptor gamma ( IL2Rγ ), and cyclin D3 ( CCND3 ) are highly connected to each other and the T-cell receptor complex (TCR). These genes were down-regulated in the GBV-C RNA positive group compared to the negative group and this result suggests that GBV-C negatively impacts T-cell receptor signaling in the liver. As indicated by the shaded areas ( Table 2 ), LCK , DOK2 , and CD3δ were chosen for further analysis. RT-qPCR was performed on liver RNA to confirm microarray results regarding LCK , DOK2, and CD3δ genes. Expression of LCK ( p = 0.02) ( Fig. 1 A) and DOK2 ( p = 0.04) ( Fig. 1 B) was significantly down-regulated in the GBV-C RNA positive group compared to the negative group, confirming microarray data. CD3δ p = 0.14 ( Fig. 1 C) was also down-regulated in the GBV-C RNA positive group but failed to reach statistical significance. RT-qPCR performed on PBMCs, mostly taken at the time of liver biopsy, showed no association with GBV-C RNA status ( Fig. 1 D–F). LCK protein expression within the liver was determined by IHC in a further expanded group. Significantly reduced expression level of LCK protein was observed in portal tracts from the GBV-C RNA positive group compared with the negative group ( p = 0.003) ( Fig. 2 A). Examples of LCK ( Fig. 2 B) and CD3 ( Fig. 2 C) portal tract staining are provided. The reduction in LCK protein expression in portal tracts from the GBV-C positive group remained significant in a multivariate logistic regression model controlling for stage of fibrosis and grade of inflammation ( p = 0.027). In contrast, no differences were seen between groups with respect to LCK protein expression in the liver parenchyma, on univariate ( p = 0.17) ( Fig. 2 D) and multivariate analysis ( p = 0.55). Examples of LCK ( Fig. 2 E) and CD3 ( Fig. 2 F) parenchymal staining are provided. These results confirm both the microarray and RT-qPCR data, including RT-qPCR results using PBMCs. In order to determine if GBV-C affects T-cell responses in peripheral blood, plasma cytokine, and T-cell responses to HCV and HIV peptide stimulation were assessed. No significant differences were seen in plasma levels of Th-1, Th-2, or T-cell/macrophage cytokine levels between GBV-C RNA negative or positive groups ( Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, the levels of IL-2, TNF- α, IFN-γ, and IL-10 cytokines were found to be low. T-cell responses against HCV and HIV peptide pools were measured ex-vivo in PBMCs using an IFN-γ and IL-10 ELISPOT assay ( Fig. 3 B). There were no significant differences in the magnitude or specificity of the T-cell responses against HCV or HIV peptides between the GBV-C groups. The majority of HCV-specific T-cell responses were at a low level (50 SFC/10 6 PBMCs). Discussion In this well characterized HCV/HIV patient group, we demonstrated that GBV-C RNA is associated with significant down-regulation of genes critical to intra-hepatic T-cell signaling. LCK and DOK2 mRNAs were down-regulated in GBV-C RNA positive patients compared to negative patients. Moreover, LCK protein expression in CD3 positive T-cells within hepatic portal tracts was significantly reduced in GBV-C positive patients even after controlling for hepatic fibrosis stage and grade of inflammation using multivariate logistic regression modeling. Furthermore, advanced hepatic fibrosis and inflammation were significantly reduced in association with GBV-C RNA consistent with our earlier study [8] . Other than GBV-C, various factors have been suggested as influencing HCV disease progression in HIV co-infection including CD4 immunosuppression, older age at infection, and excess alcohol intake [10] . Other than age at time of infection, these factors were controlled for in this study. LCK is a member of the SRC family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases and is critical in TCR signaling and T-cell activation, being involved in T-cell signal transduction, cytokine production, and differentiation [16] . Dysregulation of LCK has been reported in HIV, leading to increased susceptibility to apoptosis and altered T-cell signaling [17] . DOK2 is primarily expressed in hemopoietic cells and is a key negative regulator of cytokine and innate immune responses [18] . CD3δ is essential for T-cell development [19] . Differential expression of LCK , DOK2 , and CD3δ was shown by microarray and results for LCK and DOK2 RNA were confirmed by RT-qPCR. RT-qPCR results for CD3δ RNA may have approached significance with a larger population. Importantly, LCK protein expression determined by IHC was consistent with the RT-qPCR and microarray results. LCK protein expression within CD3 positive T-cells in hepatic portal tracts was significantly reduced in GBV-C positive patients. This could be significant in the pathogenesis of HCV-related liver disease, which is predominantly a portal tract inflammatory process [20] . Differential expression of these genes appears to be confined to the liver, as no association with GBV-C RNA status was seen for LCK , DOK2 , or CD3δ mRNA expression in PBMCs. These finding were also supported by no significant differences in LCK protein expression by IHC in the liver parenchyma, based on GBV-C status. The liver parenchyma has a significant population of transient PBMCs within sinusoids that may, in part, account for these findings. Furthermore, we expected that the changes observed within the liver would be also present in circulating T-cells. In contrast, these changes were not seen in circulating T-cells, maybe due to the fact that GBV-C/HIV infected T-cells are homing to hepatic portal tracts. In order to help confirm this theory, future studies will investigate the expression of tissue specific homing receptors (CD45RO+, CCR7−) in PBMCs transfected with GBV-C cDNA [3] . No differences in Th-1 and Th-2 responses were observed according to GBV-C status. This is consistent with our findings that the changes associated with GBV-C are confined to the liver but nevertheless different from what has been previously found in GBV-C/HIV infection. Nunnari et al. found that IL-2 and IL-12 levels decreased significantly and IL-4 and IL-10 levels increased significantly in the GBV-C negative group but did not change in the positive group [21] . However, there were significant differences in their study design compared to our current work. Nunnari et al. conducted a prospective longitudinal follow-up study to evaluate HIV-1 progression over 8 years in patients with a relatively short duration of HIV seropositivity at baseline (<10 months). Over 50% of patients were either HBV or HCV infected and a significant proportion had AIDS defining illnesses particularly in the GBV-C RNA negative group at follow-up. In contrast, ours was a cross-sectional study in long established HCV/HIV co-infected subjects in which AIDS, decompensated liver disease, and all known causes of viral hepatitis/liver disease other than HCV were excluded to avoid confounding factors that may further disrupt T-cell functioning. Consistent with our plasma cytokine and PBMCs mRNA expression results, our ex-vivo ELISPOT PBMCs data showed no significant differences in peripheral T-cell response versus GBV-C status. However, in all patients, HCV-specific T-cell responses were mostly low and close to the limit of detection of the assay, which is consistent with other studies in HCV/HIV [22] . To address this, further studies are needed to evaluate hepatic HCV-specific responses using intra-hepatic T-cells collected at liver biopsy, as T-cell frequencies in the liver are at least an order of magnitude higher than in blood [23,24] . Moreover, the analysis of the aspects of the innate immune response and natural killer cell function should be performed. GBV-C appears to affect the cellular immune response and in particular the T-cell function by causing alterations in the levels of various cytokines and associated pathways [2,21,25,26] . Most studies have been conducted in the GBV-C/HIV infected population. Our data is consistent with these findings with significant dysregulation of intra-hepatic T-cell signaling associated with GBV-C in HCV/HIV infection. Pathway Studio suggests that LCK phosphorylates CD3δ, DOK2, and the TCR, implicating LCK in the upstream regulation of these genes ( Fig. 4 ). We hypothesize that down-regulation of LCK, and to a lesser degree DOK2 and CD3δ, and alterations in associated T-cell signaling pathways in livers from GBV-C positive HCV/HIV patients could be a factor associated with a reduction in HCV-related liver disease. However, differences observed in the expression of these molecules may also be the result, rather than the cause, of differences in hepatic fibrosis and inflammation between GBV-C positive and negative groups. Furthermore, a recent study has suggested that the accumulation of HIV-specific T-cells in the liver during HCV/HIV co-infection may represent a bystander role for HIV in inducing faster progression of liver disease [27] . Our current study was limited by the small sample size particularly for RT-qPCR analysis of the liver and PBMCs samples for hypothesis testing. This does not alter the significance of the differences observed, but some comparisons may have been more significant with a larger study. Another limitation was the cross-sectional design which was largely a consequence of the difficulty in obtaining enough suitable clinical material. Despite these limitations, significant differences between two relatively small groups were shown using microarray analysis, and the data confirmed by RT-qPCR and IHC. To expand on this work, future studies are planned to develop an in vitro cell culture model of HCV/HIV infected liver to examine T-cell function and signaling in response to GBV-C. In conclusion, this study shows a significant down-regulation of genes critical to intra-hepatic T-cell signaling associated with GBV-C RNA in HCV/HIV co-infection. LCK protein expression was significantly reduced with localization to CD3-positive T-cells within portal tracts in livers from GBV-C positive patients, a difference which remained significant on multivariate analysis controlling for the degree of fibrosis and inflammation. These events appear to be intra-hepatic as no differences in T-cell related gene expression in PBMCs, plasma cytokine levels, or peripheral T-cell responses were noted. The findings have significance to the pathogenesis of HCV-related liver disease in HIV co-infection.

ABSTRACT: In the Bayburt area, the tuffs named as ""Bayburt tuffs"" outcropping in Eocene basin are made of two levels as bottom and upper units, interstratified with a claystone-marl interlayer. Lower layer contains two whereas upper one unit, and every unit show gradating from coarse towards fine- grained tuffs. Tuffs contain dominantly glass shards, pumice and crystal fragments (plagioclase, quartz, biotite, sanidine). Coarse and fine-grained levels are characterised by their crystal fragment/glass shard ratio. Based on modal composition, coarse-grained level can be classified as vitric-crystal tuff and fine- grained level as vitric tuff. Geochemically, tuffs are rhyodacite to dacitic in composition and exhibit medium-K calcalkaline and peraluminous characteristics. They show chemical variation trends, probably reflecting pre-eruption magmatic processes, especially crystal fractionation by volatile effect. Rare earth element patterns are spoon-like in shape, with (La/Lu)N=14-20, and pronounced Eu anomalies indicating plagioclase fractionation. The investigated tuffs differ from the rest of Eocene volcanics in the southern zone by their field characteristics and acidic composition. In the tuffs, presence of very fresh and angular glass shards and common crystal fragments, but lack of lithic fragments may indicate phreatomagmatic acidic volcanism in or very near to Eocene basin in the region. Furthermore, geochemical data indicate that these rocks derived from an intermediate magma source (andesitic parent).",,

This contribution aims at determining rapid changes in land cover and land use and modeling of soil erosion in the study area where we have little data. Analysis of satellite data has identified six main types of land (Land severely degraded, cereal, mix cereal and tree crops, trees, and reforestation) in the watershed of Oued El Mellah north the city of Fez (Morocco). After the loss of soil have been estimated by the RUSLE module integrated into the GIS Idrisi, the results allowed the identification of sectors across the basin where interventions are needed to limit the process of land degradation. Introduction Soil erosion is a growing problem in the north of Morocco, particularly in the Pre-Rif domain. It negatively affects agricultural productivity, reduces water infiltration, underground water resources and water availability. Previous studies of erosion and soil loss quantification in the Moroccan Rif and Prerif mountains were essentially qualitative and apprehended erosion processes and the resulting landforms (Heusch et al. 1970, Benmoussa et al. 1993, Daghmoumi 1994, Ait Fora 1995, Rahhou 1999, Al Karkouri 2003, Siteri et al. 2003). The scientific quantification of erosion and soil loss in Morocco is still lacking. The model usually adopted over the world to achieve such evaluation was the universal equation of soil loss by USLE (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978). However, in the Moroccan context, the application of the model may be problematic and should be tested to apprehend its effectiveness mainly in the Rif and Prerif region. This area is mountainous, with very steep slopes, and the 1 PhD., University Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah, o_elaroussi@yahoo.fr 2 Prof. PhD., Faculty of Letters and Human Sciences Saïss, Fez-Morocco El Aroussi, Mesrar, El Garouani, Lahrach, Beaabidate, Akdim, Jabrane 6 development of gullies and even badlands is frequent. The previous applications of the model had been operated on sheet erosion, with hilly landforms and slope inclination less than 20%. The present study aims to apply this model to the Oued El Mellah watershed, in the Prerif, where conditions are most suitable (agricultural land, slopes do not exceed 20%). The mapping approach was used to apprehend the factors involved in erosion processes: the aggressiveness of rainfall, slope, slope length, the soil erodibility, vegetation cover and tillage practices. In the current study, an effort to predict potential annual soil losses has been conducted using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) adopted in a Geographical Information System framework. It is used for the prediction of sheet erosion depending on the distribution of the aggressiveness of rainfall, the erodibility of soil, topography, land use practices and crop management. GIS (ArcGis 9.3, Idrisi Andes) and remote sensing data are both used for modeling of soil erosion in the Oued El Melleh watershed. Results are illustrated in a map that allows the prioritization of the action across the watershed. 1. Study site The Oued El Malleh catchment (fig. 1) is located at the North of Fez city and extends on the Prerif domain. Its area is approximately 34 km2. It is bordered in the East and North by the Oued Sebou valley, in the West by the Oued Mekkes catchment and in the South by the Saiss plain, with altitudes varying between 250 m and 900 m (Jbel Zalagh). Fig. 1 Localization and Digital Elevation Model of the El Malleh catchment The potential annual soil loss using the revised universal soil loss equation 7 2. Physical environment 2.1. Slope. The map of the spatial distribution of topographic slope of the Basin of Oued El Malleh was generated from a Digital Elevation Model with 5m resolution. This map shows a very abrupt relief with slopes exceeding 80% along Jabal Zalagh (fig. 2). Fig. 2 Slopes of the El Malleh catchment 2.2. Geology. The study area belongs to the Pre-Rif domain where several geological formations appear at the catchment scale. We observe different sedimentary deposits of different ages (fig 3): Gypsiferous clays and salt Triasic in age at the North-West basin (Essahlaoui et al., 2001), Calcareous sandstone which is Liasic in age at the Jbel Tghat and Jbel Zalagh; Miocene marls with interbedded sandstone; Pliocene conglomerates at he Merinids site; The quaternary travertine supporting the Medina of Fez; The basin is crossed by Oued El Malleh and oriented from the West to the East. There are several springs in the basin but their discharge is low. El Aroussi, Mesrar, El Garouani, Lahrach, Beaabidate, Akdim, Jabrane 8 2.3. Soil types and textures. Four different types of soil textures are observed in the area: • the sandy texture for aerated soil, with a high nutrient content 10 and C2 units; • the silty texture, for a fairly solid ground, rich oozes, and poor physical properties 4, 15, 16 and C1 units; • the clay texture, in soils rich in clay, poorly ventilated, impervious and difficult to cultivate 17 unit; • the balanced texture corresponding to the optimal texture, with all the qualities of the previous types 3 and 19 units. Fig. 3 Geology of the El Malleh catchment Complementary analyses were made on these soils (Fig. 4) and show that: Equivalent humidity is very high for the undeveloped soil (5-11%) the lowest values are found in the calcimagnesic soil (from 2% to 4%). pH is moderately basic (between 7.89 and 9.88). CaCO3 levels vary between 37% and 68% for the undeveloped soil and 40% for calcimagnesic soils. The potential annual soil loss using the revised universal soil loss equation 9 organic matter content is very high for Vertisols (5.83), and minimum values are observed for calcimagnesic soils (between 0.67% and 1.29%). Fig. 4 Soil humidity, calcimetry, organic matter content and pH Following these results, the Oued El Malh catchment is a fragile context that favors erosion, considering its topographic, geologic and pedologic characteristics. 3. Potential soil loss estimation 3.1. Methodology and measurements. The RUSLE module was integrated in the Idrisi software. This module not only calculates soil losses for each pixel of the grid but also for groups of pixels into homogeneous polygons, based on the slope criteria, orientation and slope length which can be adjusted by the user (Wall et al., 2002; Sadiki et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2008).The model combines empirical RUSLE factors affecting the extent of erosion and is as follows (Fig. 5): A = R.K.LS.C.P where: A = estimated average soil loss in (t/h/yr), K = soil erodibility factor, LS = topographic factor integrating gradient and slope length, C = Cover-management factor, P = Support practice factor. The RUSLE factors were calculated (in the form of raster layers) for our watershed in the basis of the soil and land use map (Fig. 5). The R-factor was calculated from monthly and annual precipitation data. The K-factor was estimated El Aroussi, Mesrar, El Garouani, Lahrach, Beaabidate, Akdim, Jabrane 10 using soil maps available from the Soil Geographical Data Base of Europe at a scale of 1:25,000. The LS-factor was calculated from a 25 m digital elevation model. The C-factor was calculated using image from Google Maps and field observations (Fig. 6). The P-factor in absence of data was set to 1. Fig. 5 RUSLE schematic approach used The RUSLE factors were calculated (in the form of raster layers) for our watershed in the basis of the soil and land use map (Fig. 5). The R-factor was calculated from monthly and annual precipitation data. The K-factor was estimated using soil maps available from the Soil Geographical Data Base of Europe at a scale of 1:25,000. The LS-factor was calculated from a 25 m digital elevation model. The C-factor was calculated using image from Google Maps and field observations (Fig. 6). The P-factor in absence of data was set to 1. 3.2. Results. More than 90% of the total basin area of Oued El Mellah is covered by cereals, olives, or a mixture of both cultures, while other land (badland, irrigated agriculture, dump, and reforestation) represents only 7% of the basin area. The potential annual soil loss using the revised universal soil loss equation 11 Given the complexity and diversity of geological facies several soil types occurs in the region. There are eight soil units (raw minerals, little change erosion, little change colluvial input, Vertisol rounded surface, Calcimagnesic, Isohumic, Complex units 2 , 3, and 4, Complex units 3 and 16). Fig. 6 Soil units and land use Fig. 7 Soil K-Factor and C-Factor The K and C factors of each soil and land use unit are reported in the Table.1. The average soil losses determined by RUSLE vary between 5.6 t / ha / yr as the minimum value measured in the urban areas and 150.7 t / ha / yr as the maximum value recorded at the badland areas, which are generally unprotected Regosols located on steep slopes. The areas occupied by annual crops also show a high susceptibility to soil erosion, with annual losses of 41.6 t / ha / year (Tab. 2).

In the present study two tectonically superimposed units separated by an overthrust are distinguished. The upper unit includes a large Albian submarine salt glacier within a well characterized stratigraphic succession ranging from uppermost Aptian to Turonian. The lower unit shows a disseminated synsedimentary or early diagenetic mineralization of sphalerite within Maastrichtian white limestones together with evaporitic celestite deposited in detrital beds of Upper Palaeocene to Lutetian age. This unit is interpreted as a normal sequence overturned during the Tertiary folding. The core of the Bou Khil mine anticline is well dated by lower Maastrichtian marls but not by Palaeocene, as it was previously proposed. This observation argues against an antiformal syncline interpretation. The Bou Khil overthrust can represent the tectonic superimposition of two different neighbouring halokinetic structures, possibly related to the emergence of the frontal decollement. The Teboursouk decollement separates the northern salt glaciers domain from the southern typical diapirs domain. This interpretation clearly argues against a diapiric overhanging model.",,

The sediment cores were obtained using a Kajak tube sampler. Analyses of HM, PAH and PCB were done by the AAS, ICP-AES and GC MS methods. OM, SiO2, TH, Ca, Mg, CO2, Fe, Al, Mn, TN and TP were measured. The research showed that the sediments of Lake Karczemne, into which the untreated municipal sewage was discharged, are characterized by a high content of P. It was found that the sediments accumulate toxins, OM and pollutants characteristic for various industries. Karczemne Lake which collected municipal and industrial wastewater, contained a high content of Pb, Cu and PAH in the sediments, and Domowe Małe Lake, receiving stormwater, contained high concentrations of PAH. Research has shown that one of the most important tools for selecting an appropriate method of lake restoration is the analysis of the spatial distribution of pollutants in the bottom sediments. Thanks to such an analysis of the composition of the bottom sediments and the correlation between the components of the sediments and their sorption properties, the restoration of the Karczemne Lake using the Ripl method was planned and the possibility of restoration of the Domowe Małe Lake in this way was eliminated. How we can disrupt ecosystem of urban lakes – pollutants of bottom sediment in two shallow water bodies 41 Heavy metals (e.g. Hg, Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Bi) occurring in lake ecosystem are very dangerous due to their toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation (Waisberg et al. 2003, Bocca et al. 2004). Polychlorinated biphenyls are used, for example, in the production of transformers, plastics, protective paints and lubricants. They are ionic compounds with very low solubility in water, which are easily bioaccumulated in aquatic organisms (especially in mollusks), and they have a negative effect on plant growth, inhibiting the photosynthesis process and reducing the content of chlorophyll (Lidell et al. 2001, Jeremiason et al. 2011). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are produced during the processing of fuels, mainly coal and crude oil. These are the compounds that are harmful to aquatic organisms. They can be endogenously synthesized by some bacteria and plants (Jeremiason et al. 1999, Sanders et al. 1996). In Poland and in the world, many different restoration techniques are used to restore the good condition of lakes. The bottom sediment removal (Ripl method) is a radical, but highly effective, restoration method for shallow, heavily degraded reservoirs (Ripl 1976a, 1976b, Zamparas et al. 2018). During the design of lake restoration using Ripl method the spatial distribution of nutrients and organic pollutants, toxic compounds and heavy metals should be carefully examined. Knowing the sediment composition allows to accurately determine the sediment layer to be removed to obtain a clear improvement of the environmental conditions in the lake. Moreover, it is extremely important to know the content of toxic substances, because the sediment excessively loaded with such substances must be disposed of after being extracted from the bottom of the water body. The processing, management and utilization of deposits is often the biggest logistical and economic challenge. The goal of the research was to analyze the content of mineral, organic and toxic pollutants in the bottom sediments of two urban lakes, which act as receivers for rainwater and municipal sewage. Material and methods Description of the research objects Karczemne Lake is a flow-through, hypertrophic water body located in Kartuzy town (Kashubian Lake District), and Domowe Małe Lake is located in Western Masuria, in the Pasym group, in the physical and geographic area: Mrągowo Lakeland – Masurian Lakeland Voivodeship (Kondracki 2011) (Fig. 1). The lakes are situated in the Vistula basin. An area of Karczemne Lake is 40.4 ha, and its maximum depth is 2.3 m (Table 1). In the mid-1950s Karczemne Lake was transformed into municipal, storm and industrial (dairy and slaughterhouse wastewater, brewery, furniture and paint factories and petrol stations) sewage receiver. For over 30 years of the raw municipal sewage went to Karczemne Lake through six sanitary sewers (Fig. 2). In 1982, a mechanical-biological sewage treatment plant was launched. In the 1990s almost the entire city was connected to sanitary sewerage system, and it was only in 2010 that the management of storm water began to be organized by building settling tanks and storm water separators. Until 2018, the storm water drainage network in Kartuzy covered only part of the city – 17%. This situation meant that during heavy rainfall, local flooding occurred and the excess of rainwater and snowmelt from streets that did not have a rainwater drainage system penetrated the sanitary sewerage system, overloading it. The connection of the existing storm water drainage system to the sanitary sewerage system caused the raw sewage loading into the lake. From 2018 the rainwater has been discharged into the lake by six collectors. Actually, the total catchment area of Karczemne Lake covers 5.15 km2 (57% forests and 43% urbanized Fig. 1.

Templin areas), and the direct catchment of the lake, excluding the area covered by the drainage system collecting rainwater, covers 0.45 km2 (20.7% barren lands, 79.3% forests). The Kashubian Lake District, where Karczemne Lake is located, is covered with Quaternary sediments of glacial origin (Piasecki 1960). The geological structure includes: Jurassic and Cretaceous formations from the Mesozoic group as well as Tertiary and Quaternary formations from the Cenozoic era. The lower layer consists of sediment made of gray siltstones with dark inserts. There are marls, sands and sandstones, as well as loams above. Domowe Małe Lake is a small, polymictic, flow-through urban lake. According to the latest measurements and morphometric studies (Wróbel 2012), the lake has a water table area of 11.4 ha and reaches a maximum depth of 4.9 m, with an average depth of 3.05 m (Table 1). The total catchment area of Domowe Małe Lake covers an area of approximately 5.90 km2 (Planter et al. 2005) with majority of this area being the catchment of Domowe Duże Lake located above. Nearly 85% of this area is urban, and the remaining 15% is grassland. The catchment surface of Domowe Małe Lake covers about 1.2 km2 and has been delineated taking into account the areas of the city from which rainwaters are drained. The main pollution factor in Domowe Małe Lake was rainwater discharged before the modernization of the rainwater drainage system by 15 collectors into the lake (Fig. 3). Table 1.

The following 13 trace elemenys were also spectrographically determined: Ag, B, Co, Cr, Cu, Ga, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sc, Sr, V and Zr. The chemical data are statistically treated and discussed in conjunction with the regional geologic setting. For most aerated shelf basins, Si, Al, Ti, Zr and Sc and the insoluble residue all increase together. They represent the resistate detrital fraction of the sediments which appreciablyy increases in the shallower nearshore facies of these stable shelves. Ca, Mg and Sr generally tally with the carbonate content. In the black shales, Co and to a mucch lesser extent Ni, V and Cr crudely increase with increase in total organic matter content. For all marine samples boron contents are generally below that of the ‘average shale’ of Turekian and Wedepohl (1961) and this may be related in part to the dominance of montmorillonite, mixed-layer clays and kaolinite rather than true illite in the clay mineralogy of the majority of Egyptian mudrocks and marls. The Cretaceous black shales associated with the phosphorite beds are not particularly enriched in trace metals and their content fluctuetes in response to their much varied and changing depositional environments.

The Magura Nappe is the largest and southernmost tectonic unit of the Western Outer Caipathians and differ in lithofacies development from the Middle and Marginal groups of units. The age studies of the youngest deposits of the Magura Nappe play an important role in understanding the tectogenesis of the Outer Carpathians. The aim of this work was to find the litho- and biostratigraphic correlation with the more external units. For this purpose the youngest deposits from selected sections of the Magura Nappe located east of the Skawa River, were chosen. For the lower limit of the youngest sediments, Middle/Upper Eocene variegated shales with Reticulophragmium amplectens Grzybowski were taken. The analysis of nannoplankton assemblages enable to establish the age of these deposits which varies from Middle Eocene (NP15) up to Upper Oligocene (NP25) and Lower Miocene (NN2). The Eocene/Oligocene boundary lies within the NP21 nanno-zone and was found in the Krynica Zone within the Globigerina Marls (Leluchow section), in the Raca Zone within Poprad Sandstone Mbr of the Magura Fm. and in the Siary Zone within supra-Magura (Budzow) Beds (Budzow section), Wątkowa Sandstone (Ropica and Malastow sections) and within Zembrzyce (sub-Magura) Beds (Folusz section). In the Raca and Krynica zones the youngest - Upper Oligocene deposits from the studied sections belong to the Malcov Fm., whereas in the Siary Zone they belong to the supra-Magura (Budzow) Beds. The age of the Malcov Fm. was determined as NP24 in Leluchow and as NP25 in the Nowy Sącz I borehole, whereas the Budzow Beds belong to zone NP24. The youngest deposits so far described from the Magura Nappe belong to the Zawada Fm. whose age was determined as NN2. In the Polish part of the Bystrica Zone deposits younger than NP18, have so far not been found. The analysis of autochtonous nannoplankton assemblages from the Magura Basin enable to follow the palaeoecological changes in the Magura Basin, both in regional and global sense, from Late Eocene through Oligocene. The global changes are the drop of the water temperature accompanied by the progressing eutrophication of the Magura Basin. Further events were also recorded in zone NP23. The assemblage of this zone was characterised by the presence of species which are believed to be indicative of brackish water and restricted to the Paratethys region.",,

Oriented and ethylene glycol-solvated samples produce a rational series of basal reflections, where 001 occurs at similar to 17.8 angstrom as an intense, narrow (1.1 degrees 20) and fairly symmetrical reflection. Upon solvation with glycerol, the 001 reflection shifts to similar to 18.7 angstrom. The chemical composition of this saponite is similar to stevensite. However, the structural formula of Na0.114Ca0.013K0.003(Mg2.957Al0.004Fe0.028Ti0.004)(Si3.826Al0.174)O-10(OH)(2) indicates that vacancies in the octahedral sheet do not exist. The negative layer charge arises nearly entirely from the Substitutions in the tetrahedral sheet, with the net layer charge of -0.148, smaller than for common smectites. Due to the XRD characteristics and particularly the layer-charge distribution, it was concluded that this mineral is a Mg-rich saponite with low layer charge. The saponite was formed by direct precipitation in in alkaline lake environment from Mg- and Si-rich solutions at high pH.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/79/E5/FB/79E5FB691E37827B3BA360041A516615.pdf

Palaeoenvironmental interpretation of these deposits was obtained from sedimentological and palaeontological data in earlier studies. The non-marine environments recorded are: alluvial, fluvial (channel and flood plain deposits) and lacustrine (prevailing terrigenous, organic-rich or carbonate sedimentation). Marine environments are represented by littoral and shelf deposits. In most of these palaeoenvironments, terrigenous sedimentation prevailed except in the marine shelf, where mixed sedimentation was dominant, and in the carbonate and organic-rich lakes. In general, Palaeogene freshwater lakes were perennial, open and exorheic, with carbonate waters. The Palaeogene deposits were derived from Jurassic and Early Cretaceous pelagic and hemipelagic marls. The clay mineral assemblage of these source-area rocks was mostly smectite, interstratified illite-smectite and illite. The weathering of these materials under high temperature and rainfall favoured the hydrolysis of clay minerals and the formation of kaolinite. X-ray diffraction, TEM and EDX analysis were carried out on 108 samples of palaeogene mudstones. Clay minerals identified were illite, interstratified illite-smectite, smectite, chlorite and kaolinite. The various Palaeogene environments (marine, transitional and non-marine) can be distinguished on the basis of different clay mineral assemblages. These assemblages are related to weathering and diagenetic processes as well as to the distance from the source area. Alluvial sediments contain smectite and kaolinite with subordinate amounts of illite. All these clay minerals are of detrital origin. Smectite and kaolinite are present in all environments but the proportion of kaolinite to smectite increases with the distance from the source. The K-rich interstitial waters derived from illite hydrolysis in the source area favoured the formation of mixed-layer illite-smectite in the alluvial flood plain where the stagnation of waters during dry periods allowed the concentration of dissolved ions. Fluvial deposits contain interstratified illite-smectite, smectite, kaolinite, illite and chlorite in variable amounts. Variations in the proportion of illite and the occasional occurrence of chlorite was attributed to compositional differences in the source area and variations in the sediment supply input. The terrigenous and carbonate lakes preserved the detrital clay mineral assemblage carried by the rivers. Organic-rich lakes contain mainly kaolinite and smectite with less illite. Littoral deposits contain kaolinite and illite with minor amounts of smectite and interstratified smectite-illite. Shelf deposits are mostly formed by illite and kaolinite.",,

The purpose of the present study is to fill this gap using mineralogical, geochemical and isotopic characterization of cyclic sedimentation within Neogene sedimentary units. Early Miocene alluvial-fan to cyclic shallow-lacustrine sediments of the Aktoprak Basin consist of conglomerate, sandstone, mudstone, marl, limestone and palaeosol. The increasingly fine upward grain size and bed thicknesses suggest that the alluvial fan was fed by an ephemeral braided river. The cyclic sandflat mudflat shallow-lake succession is predominantly composed of small-scale sandstone-mudstone beds. Sandstone intervals in the sedimentary cycles are interpreted to be a result of sedimentation from shallow, ephemeral braided-river channels, the deposits having evolved under water-saturated conditions in response to climate changes. The mudstone intervals are interpreted as having been laid down via sedimentation during distal sheet floods which developed either under sub-aerial exposure or in a water-saturated environment. Palaeocurrent measurements indicate that the general transport direction in the Early Miocene was from east to west. The lacustrine sediments of the Aktoprak Basin consist of calcite + quartz + feldspar + serpentine coexisting mainly with smectite palygorskite illite chlorite. Illite and chlorite are either detrital, having originated from basement units, or the illite formed authigenically from smectite. Calcite and clay appear as cement-building conglomerate, sandstone and mudstone. The clay content decreases with increasing calcite and the presence of an inverse relationship between CaO and other oxides may correspond to an inverse relationship between calcite and other minerals. Furthermore, Al2O3, Fe2O3, TiO2, MgO, Ni, Co, Cu, Sr, Ba and Zr values in the smectite-bearing mudstone and sandstone are consistent with the chemical compositions of rocks in the surrounding area, mainly ophiolitic and volcanogenic associations. Micromorphologically, the development of smectite as a cement on leached feldspar, the occurrence of palygorskite fibres as bridges between crystals and rock fragments, as well as the presence of 'edging' smectite flakes suggest an authigenic origin. Field observations, mineralogy, geochemistiy and the results of delta O-18 and delta C-13 isotopic determinations reveal that periodic palaeoclimatic changes were controlled by alternating wet and dry periods that resulted in a relative upward decrease in precipitation of authigenic smectite +/- palygorskite within the sections, under the influence of geochemical and pH fluctuations in meteoric water within the shallow-lake environment.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/74/38/9C/74389C852B47E9A34D09AF0E894AF33B.pdf

Even though palynomorphs have been found at several levels, the fossil assemblages generally consist of many different benthic groups representing shallow marine environments. Brachiopods are the dominant group in these assemblages, which also include sponges, molluscs and crinoid remains. Foraminifers and ostracodes are the most abundant microfossils. Conodonts are very scarce. These palaeontological data allow us to correlate the Demues strata with other successions in the Picos de Europa Unit, as well as to date it in terms of both the West European and the Russian stratigraphic scales. The succession at Demues ranges in age from uppermost Moscovian or basal Kasimovian to the middle part of the Kasimovian (upper Khamovnicheskian) in the Russian stratigraphic scale, and probably from Cantabrian (lower?) to a level near the Barruelian /Estefanian B in the West European stratigraphic scale.

Results show that at least four distinct fluid systems influenced the basin margin, and demonstrate the sensitivity of reef rocks as paleohydrological archives in siliciclastic environments, The earliest calcite cements precipitated from meteoric waters at shallow burial depths, and mineralogical stabilization of reef carbonate was mostly completed during this episode. Textural and isotope trends typical of paleoexposure surfaces are lacking, and trace element results suggest that meteoric waters were transmitted laterally and/or upward into the reef via delta-lobe sandstone paleoaquifers. The distribution of late cements is highly variable and fracture-fed, demonstrating the importance of deformation in controlling fluid flow subsequent to reef lithification. Isotopic and elemental compositions of burial calcites, plus their paragenetic association with barite and dolomite, show that fluids of marine parentage were expelled from compacting basinal marls into the basin margin paleoaquifers. The Calders reef also records an episode of extrabasinal fluid circulation, probably associated with faulting of the basin margin. Ferroan saddle dolomite contains fluid inclusions with elevated homogenization temperatures, indicating thermal disequilibrium with the surrounding strata.

The Karak and the Hammamat Formations are entirely fluvial and composed mainly of sandstone with minor amounts of conglomerates and silt-mudstones. Violet to red color mottling in a gray colored siltstone, and well developed fining upward sequences distinguish the Hammamat from the Karak Formation. The depositing river system was braided during the time of the Karak Formation and evolved into a meandering one of intermediate sinuosity during the Hammamat Formation time. The Bir Fa'as Formation consists of alternating beds of arenaceous-argillaceous dolostone, mudstone-marl, and fine-grained sandstone. It was deposited in an environment that fluctuated between shallow intertidal flats and a deeper subtidal to inner shelf region of the Tethys. In northern Jordan, the KG is also subdivided into three formations which are Ramel, Jarsah and Bir Fa'as from base to top. The Ramel Formation consists of fluvial siliciclastic deposited by a braided river system, and an intercalated arenaceous dolomitic unit deposited by a minor incursion of the Tethys Seaway. The Jarash Formation is composed mainly of bedded mixed siliciclastic-carbonate facies deposited in a tidal flat of the Tethys with a few interbeds of dolostone and black shale that were deposited in a deeper open shelf environment and in a tidal marsh or a coastal swamp, respectively. The formation is terminated by a meandering river siliciclastic sequence deposited during a regression of the sea. The Bir Fa'as Formation of northern Jordan is similar to that of central and southern Jordan but of a greater thickness and a lower elastic content. At the early time of the KG the Kurnub River was flowing northwestward from the south-located Arabian-Nubian Shield towards the Tethys. It shifted its course towards the north during the time of the KG as it approached the north- and northwest-located Tethys Seaway.",,
6229bf595aee126c0fa1176b,Marea 2001 : Note on the Pottery,,[{'name': 'Grzegorz Majcherek'}],"This season's pottery finds come either from the topsoil layer or from fill deposits and, consequently, cannot be safely attributed to any undisturbed contexts.1) Although some rebuilding and changes of the bath plan are easily identified, so far none of the deposits could be associated with these alterations. Some of the finds, therefore, can be either residual or postdating the destruction of the building. Due to the usual shortcomings of such material, all the observations should be regarded as largely provisional. The spectrum of pottery forms appears to be broadly similar to that briefly discussed in the previous report.2) Commonwares apparently prevail in the collected material. All the type-forms are a representative cross-section of the 7th8th century repertoire. Beside bowls, jugs and basins, recorded forms include also some cooking pots, casseroles, pans and lids that can be readily paralleled in material found on other Egyptian sites. Some of the kitchen vessels were imported from the Nile Valley proper, as evidenced by their conspicuous dark red Nile silt fabric, very often with a black core. Most of the recorded commonware fragments, however, appear to be of local Mareotic production, made either on the site itself or in the surrounding region. Unfortunately, the similarity of regional raw materials excludes specific attribution. The fabric is invariably made of local calcareous marl clay with considerable quantities of calcite inclusions frequently erupting on the surface, and fine sand temper. Very few mica specks are visible occasionally. Color ranges from reddishyellow (7,5 YR 7/4) through olive gray (5/6 Y 6/2) to yellow (2,5 Y 8/4), and is most likely due to varied firing conditions.3) The surface is usually unslipped, although very often coated with a light cream self-slip, resulting from salt precipitation during drying. The most numerous regionally produced pottery group consists of deep, footed, carinated bowls, with everted or knobbed rims, displaying a great variety of contours (Fig. 1). Some of the examples were painted with faint dark red decoration representing wavy lines or simplified festoons (cf. Fig. 1:2), typical of Coptic-period pottery.4) Of greater interest are several fragments of Mareotic incised ware (cf. Fig. 3:3).

Natural cementitious environments at two sites, Maqarin and Daba, in Jordan offer evidence that extensive carbonation can occur at field scales under both unsaturated and saturated conditions. Here, in situ spontaneous combustion of bituminous marl in the past has led to calcination and formation of calcium/silica/alumina-oxides typical of portland cement clinker. Retrograde alteration within these metamorphic zones began with hydration and precipitation of portlandite as a rock forming mineral along with ettringite, thaumasite, and other calcium-silica-hydrate-like phases.Metamorphism was a relatively recent event at the Maqarin site. Here hyperalkaline groundwater discharge from the alteration zones with two distinct geochemical facies: (a) higher TDS Ca-K-Na-OH-SO4 groundwaters (pH > 12.5) apparently represent the earliest discharge following hydration, and (b) lower TDS Ca-OH groundwaters (pH 12.0 to 12.4) which appear to be later-stage leachates from the alteration zone. Subsequent carbonation has precipitated secondary calcite observed in the Eastern alteration zone. In central Jordan, travertines associated with the Daba marble record a third phase of porewater discharge where silica has been remobilized during carbonation of CSH-like phases.The unique geochemical features of the Maqarin site were examined to evaluate the validity of using it as a potential natural analogue for cement grout carbonation reactions studied under laboratory conditions.",,

This succession has been divided in four stratigraphic intervals on the basis of their sedimentological and palaeoecological features. The fi rst interval (middle to upper Campanian, Globotruncana ventricosa, Globotruncanita calcarata, and Globotruncana falsostuarti biozones) consists in rhythmically bedded limestones formed by a slow and relatively steady fallout of biogenic debris in an upper bathyal setting. The second interval (latest Campanian to lower Maastrichtian, lower to middle part of the Gansserina gansseri biozone) is defi ned by the presence of fi ne-grained calcarenites deposited under the influence of bottom currents. The onset of that infl uence was probably related with the beginning of the convergence between Iberia and Africa that led to a narrowing of the passage between them, and thus to an intensifi cation and a deepening of the oceanic currents in the area. The third interval (upper Maastrichtian, upper part of the G. gansseri biozone and the Abathomphalus
mayaroensis biozone) is formed by marls deposited in a mixed hemipelagic environment, deeper than that of the previous unit, and with high fi ne terrigenous input. Towards the end of this interval, this environment began to receive sporadic turbiditic deposits. During the fourth interval (Palaeocene, Parasubbotina pseudobulloides, Praemurica trinidadensis, Praemurica uncinata, Morozovella angulata, Igorina pusilla, and Globanomalina pseudomenardii biozones) the same type of sedimentation, including turbidite input, prevailed.
The four intervals are bounded by episodes of rapid environmental change, refl ected in the stratigraphic succession by abrupt transitions in facies. These episodes, latest Campanian, “middle” Maastrichtian and latest Maastrichtian to earliest Palaeocene in age, can be correlated with regional stratigraphic unconformities in the more proximal and shallower sections of the Prebetic domain, and be interpreted as regional events. The origin of these events, according to their regional features, is mainly tectonic, probably related to the onset of the alpine convergence in that continental margin.

En este trabajo se presenta un estudio sedimentologico y bioestratigrafi co integrado de la sucesion de edad Campaniense a Paleoceno de Caravaca de la Cruz (SE de Espana), el cual permite reconstruir la evolucion ambiental para ese periodo en este sector de los dominios pelagicos a hemipelagicos de la antigua margen continental sur de Iberia. Atendiendo a sus caracteristicas sedimentologicas y paleoecologicas, estos depositos se han dividido en cuatro unidades estratigrafi cas. La primera unidad (Campaniense
medio a superior, biozonas de Globotruncana ventricosa, Globotruncanita calcarata y Globotruncana falsostuarti) esta constituida por calizas de aspecto ritmico, formadas a partir de la decantacion de fi no material biogenico en un ambiente marino abierto a profundidades batiales superiores. La segunda unidad (Campaniense terminal a Maastrichtiense inferior, parte inferior a media de la
biozona de Gansserina gansseri) se caracteriza por la presencia de depositos calcareniticos de grano fi no producidos por la accion de corrientes de fondo. El inicio de la actividad de estas corrientes sobre el fondo marino estuvo probablemente relacionado con el comienzo de la convergencia entre Iberia y Africa, que pudo originar un estrechamiento en la zona de paso entre ambas zonas
emergidas y, por consiguiente, una intensifi cacion y profundizacion de las corrientes oceanicas. La tercera unidad (Maastrichtiense superior, parte superior de la biozona de Gansserina gansseri y biozona de Abathomphalus mayaroensis) esta formada por margas depositadas en un ambiente hemipelagico mixto, probablemente algo mas profundo que el desarrollado durante la etapa anterior y
que recibia mayores aportes de terrigenos de grano fi no. Hacia el fi nal de este intervalo, este medio comenzo a recibir esporadicos aportes turbiditicos.

 the Mut (Içel) town. Mut (Içel) and nearby areas are geologically known as Mut Basin situated in the Central Taurides. In
 the Mut Basin, Middle Miocene time is represented by Mut and Köselerli formations. The Mut Formation comprises reef limestone
 and interfingers with the Köselerli Formation consisting of claystone, argillaceous limestone and marl.
 
 Dagpazari patch reef has a gentle and elongated dome shape. Its elongation extends in NW-SE direction. In the Dagpazari patch
 reef and its surrounding, five lithofacies and several subfacies have been delineated based mainly on reef geometry and also
 macro and micro facies features. This patch reef is approximately 15 m thick, 500 m in length and 200 m in width. These are;
 1) Base facies (red algal wackestone-packstone, Dunham 1962; biomicrite, Folk 1962); 2) Reef core facies (coral-red algal
 framestone-bindstone, Embry and Klovan 1971; biolithite, Folk 1962); gastropodpelecypod wackestone-packstone, biomicrite;
 grainstone, biosparite); 3) Fore reef-flank facies (planktonic foraminiferal-red algal wackestone, biomicrite); 4) Back reef-flank
 facies (wackestone, biomicrite; local framestone-bindstone, biolithite); 5) Sealing facies (echinoid-intraclast packstone-grainstone,
 biointramicrite, biointrasparite).
 
 
 
 Reef core facies is easily separated from other reef facies by: i) presence of frame-building organisms (coral); ii) presence
 of binding organisms (red algae, bryozoa); and iii) diverse fauna. Reef-flank facies are separated from reef core facies due
 to their well-bedded appearance. The sealing facies truncates the other reef units with an erosional surface.
 
 
 
 Facies and frame-building organisms were highly affected by sea-level fluctuation during the Langhian. Grainstone (Dunham
 1962) occurred where the environment is close to wave base; planktonic foraminiferal wackestone (Dunham 1962) deposited where
 the environment was relatively deep. In overall, the Dagpazari patch reef was deposited in shallow environment.",,

Mortimore'}]","The Chalk of England is not renowned for producing karst landforms. This paper introduces a previously undescribed karst phenomenon, termed here dissolution tubules, from the Chalk of Sussex. The internal structure of these features was investigated by developing a novel method of resin impregnation and acid digestion. This revealed tubules to be a truly dendritic landform. Their relationships with chalk macrotextures were investigated using the Bushinski oil technique (BROMLEY 1981) and revealed an association with trace fossil burrows. Detailed electron microscopic examination of chalk adjacent to the karst surface, employing the textural analysis methods of MORTIMORE & FIELDING (1990), revealed dissolutional textural modification of the chalk to a depth of approximately 15 mm beneath the dissolution surface and a possible spatial association of dissolution tubules with microfractures. Dissolution tubules in the field were found overlying major discontinuities such as subhorizontal sheet flints, marl seams, hardgrounds, major fractures and caves. Evidence gathered suggests mixing corrosion (BOGLI 1964) as the process responsible for their formation.",,

Both successions are characterized by alternation of carbonates and siliciclastics (Poire, 1987; Gaucher, 2000), as well as a geotectonic setting corresponding to a passive continental margin. The Yerbal, Polanco and Cerro Espuelitas Formations (ASG) are correlated lithostratigraphically to the Cerro Largo, Loma Negra and Cerro Negro Formations of Tandilia. Whereas the ASG is up to 5 km thick, the SBG-CNFm represents a strongly condensed section showing numerous erosive surfaces and only 350 m in thickness. This difference may be explained by the shallower, epicontinental sedimentary environment of the SBG-CNFm. The predominantly siliciclastic Yerbal and Cerro Largo Formations represent the transgression of the Vendian (Ediacaran) sea onto the Rio de la Plata Craton. The overlying Polanco and Loma Negra Formations are characterized by thick and pure carbonate (especially limestone) deposits currently mined in both countries for use in the cement, lime and fertilizer industries. An expressive palaeokarst is developed on top of these carbonates, indicating sea-level drop and platform exposure (Barrio et al., 1991; Gaucher et al., 2004b). The lower Cerro Espuelitas Formation and the Cerro Negro Formation are made up of marls at the base, passing into shales and heterolithic facies up section.
We report for the first time the occurrence of Cloudina cf. C. riemkeae Germs (1972) in micritic limestones of the Loma Negra Formation. This supports the correlation of this unit with the lower Polanco Formation, where these shelly fossils also occur (Gaucher y Sprechmann, 1999; Gaucher et al., 2003b). Moreover, Cloudina is currently regarded as an index fossil of the late Ediacaran (Grant, 1990; Amthor et al., 2003). Low diversity acritarch assemblages occur both in the ASG and SBG-CNFm. In the former, two assemblages were distinguished: a Bavlinella faveolata- Soldadophycus assemblage occurring mainly in the siliciclastic units, and a slightly more diverse Leiosphaeridia-Lophosphaeridium assemblage characteristic of the Polanco Formation (Gaucher, 2000). In the SBG-CNFm, the acritarch asemblage is sphaeromorph-dominated (mainly Leiosphaeridia), and similar to the Leiosphaeridia-Lophosphaeridium microflora of the ASG. For the first time we report acritarchs occurring in greenish pelites of the Villa Monica Formation, assigned here to Leiosphaeridia minutissima, L. tenuissima and Synsphaeridium sp. These represent the oldest fossils so far reported from Argentina. Pothe de Baldis (1983) described Chuaria olavarriensis, Leiosphaeridia sp. and Paleorivularia ontarica from the upper Cerro Largo Formation. The former two taxa can be reassigned to Chuaria circularis and Leiosphaeridia minutissima, respectively. Palynological macerations of shales of the Cerro Largo Formation carried out in the present study yielded Leiosphaeridia tenuissima as dominant species, and a single vesicle assigned to Leiosphaeridia minutissima. A detailed micropalaeontological study is due to Cingolani et al. (1991), which describe the following acritarch species from the Cerro Negro Formation: Leiosphaeridia sp., Trachysphaeridium sp., Synsphaeridium sp. and granular sphaeromorphs grouped by the authors under «type A» acritarchs. The application of the currently accepted taxonomic criteria to these acritarchs allows assigning them to Leiosphaeridia jacutica, L. minutissima, L. tenuissima, Lophosphaeridium sp. and Synsphaeridium sp. In the present study, acritarchs assigned to Leiosphaeridia tenuissima were isolated from shales of the Cerro Negro Formation. Throughout the SBG-CNFm, a tendency towards smaller sphaeromorphs from base to top is observed: from 450 µm for Villa Monica Formation to 380 µm for the Cerro Largo Formation and finally 200 µm for the Cerro Negro Formation. This trend has been reported for other shallow-water, marine Ediacaran successions elsewhere (Butterfield, 1997). On the basis of low diversity and dominance of sphaeromorphs, the acritarch assemblage of the SBG-CNFm can be assigned either to the Simple Leiosphere Palynoflora of Grey et al. (2003) or the younger Kotlin-Rovno assemblage of Vidal y Moczydlowska (1997). The palynoflora occurring in the lower and middle ASG has been correlated to the Kotlin-Rovno assemblage (Gaucher, 2000), supporting the lithostratigraphic correlation depicted above. Available chemostratigraphic data for the ASG and SBG-CNFm also suggest that the Loma Negra Formation correlates with the Polanco Formation. Whereas 87Sr/86Sr values for limestones of the Loma Negra Formation range between 0.7069 and 0.7087 (Kawashita et al., 1999b), limestones of the Polanco Formation yielded ratios between 0.7072 and 0.7085 (Kawashita et al., 1999a; Gaucher et al., 2004c). The Loma Negra Formation is further characterized by d13C values around +4 ‰ PDB (Gomez Peral et al., in press), which are similar to d13C relationships between +5.5 and 0 ‰ PDB reported for the lower Polanco Formation (Unit A of Gaucher et al., 2004b). Regarding the Villa Monica Formation, available data are ambiguous regarding its age assignment and correlatios. On the one hand, stromatolite assemblages described from the unit (Poire, 1987, 1993) suggest an upper Riphean age (Tonian or Cryogenian). On the other hand, the similarity of acritarch assemblages preserved throughout the SBGCNFm suggests that there is not a large time hyatus between the Villa Monica and Cerro Largo Formations, raising the possibility of the Villa Monica Formation being of Ediacaran age. The correlations here suggested imply that an extensive marine shelf developed on a large area of the Rio de la Plata Craton in the late Ediacaran, possibly under tropical climate. According to Gaucher et al. (2003b), this shelf also included the Corumba Group (Mato Grosso, Brazil), being thus at least 2500 km long.",,

The main energetic arrivals of the seismograms arrive at the array with a definite range of azimuths that is not correlated with the event back-azimuth.

These builtups are contained in quartzo-feldspathic sands, bioclastic sands, micritic muds, marls with root traces. All the sediments are calcitic; dolomite, in the form of isolated rhombs, is excessively rare. From a palaeoalgological point of view, we recognize 11 morphospecies belonging to 7 morphogenus, associated with thin layers of micrite supposed to be bacterial in origin. The algal encrustations were initially entirely micritic; in two species (Broutinella arvernensis and B. ramulosa) a more or less strong recrystallization in sparite of radial palissadic type occurs. Each species can construct a monospecific layer (lamination), but often a single lamination contains two species, and a single builtup exhibits several species. The small, movable builtups (oolites, spherulites, encrusted ostracod shells) present all the microscopical aspects of the laminations of Broutinella arvernensis. They are interpreted as resulting from biological activity, and not from a purely physico-chimical precipitation. The oncolites and the unmovable builtups are of a great internal complexity. We can schematically distinguish: the filament masses of Cladophorites incrustata, with individual filaments encrusted by Broutinella arvernensis and/or ‘bacterial’ micrite, and with a peripheral encrustation of the masses of filaments; the homogeneous stromatolites, proceeding from the growth of algal biocoenosis making floors, hemispheres and small columns, the shape of which is only linked with the algal development; the heterogeneous stromatolites, whose the initial shape is that of the encrusted substrate (accumulation of larval tubes of phrygans assembled on a vegetal tuft before hatching). On the microscopic scale, we can oppose the monobiocoenotic stromatolites, made of identical doublets (= couplets, one light lamination plus one dark lamination), and the polybiocoenotic stromatolites, made up of the superimposition of sets of doublets resulting from the activity of different biocoenosis. From a palaeoecological point of view, the climatic oscillations recognized during the epoch (warmer/cooler, drier/more humid) do not seem to have influenced the growth of the algae nor the shape or distribution of the builtups. The faunas of the associated sediments are rich in individuals and poor in species (larvae of phrygans, Cypris, hydrobiids; aerial helicids), which indicates a low salinity, but sufficient to exclude the forms of purely fresh water. Incidentally, the first indication of “concretionned limestones made of concentric scales” was reported by Omalius d'Halloy in 1812, and therefore prior to the observations of Steele [75]. So, the latter is not the discoverer of the future stromatolites of Kalkowsky.",,

The market ran hard and high for six weeks. And there isn't any reason to think there aren't more gains ahead this year and maybe next year, many analysts say . But just as you don't keeping tooling down the highway in your car without occasionally checking the gas gauge, some investment experts suggest similar occasional checks of the stock market . If there's gas left, relax and enjoy the ride . Experts can spout enough jargon to make the stock market seem complicated and esoteric to the average investor . Yet if you're not trying to play the daily and weekly shifts in the market-and most individual investors shouldn't be doing thatmuch of the sound and fury isn't neces, sary . For example, Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp ., says one reason investors can relax is that as bull markets go, this one is still young and vigorous . 'The average bull market lasts 43 months and results in a 93 .1""'c gain in stock prices,"" he says . So far, this bull market, which Mr . Johnson says began in October 1990 . is only 15 months old and has provided only a 36`""< rise . In using this history to gauge what the future may hold, Mr . Johnson conservatively eliminates tine raging bull market of 1992-1990, which lifted the Dow industrials 2S6Tc . On that basis, he says . 'If this bull market is just an average bull market, it would end in August of 1993 with the Dow industrials at 400 .' He cautions that long-term investors shouldn't try to time the inevitable temporary declines that occur in bull markets . ""It's extraordinarily difficult to call shortterm swings in the market,"" he says . ""What you want to he able to do is to catch most of the rise in a bull market and avoid most of the losses in a bear market ."" The tool that works best for that, lie says, is a simple chart comparing where the market ends each week with the average performance of the marl(et during the preceding 53 weeks . Mr. Johnson says technical analysts have determined that as long as the market finishes every Friday at a level above the 53-week moving average owning stocks is fine. When it falls beowthe moving average, it's time to sell . ""That way, you enjoy the ride up, avoid most of the declines, and don't get chewed up by sales commissions on frequent trades,"" he explains . Setting up your own chart takes a little initial investment of time and effort, but once it is constructed, maintaining it requires only a few minutes each week . Add the Friday closes of the index you choose for the past 53 weeks (for the Dow Jones industrials the total as of last Friday was 155,557 ) and divide by 53 to get the average (2992 for the Dow) . Behold : Friday's decline to 3225 .40 didn't come close to pushing the Dow below the 53-week moving average . (To keep a moving average, you must each week drop the oldest Friday close and add the latest, again dividing by 53 . ) But other analysts contend that it's even easier for typical investors to figure out whether the stock market is the place to be .

Stratigraphic variation in these properties is related to rhythmic sedimentation (climatic control) and phases of tectonic activity which enhance the effects of sea-level fluctuations. Geographic variation relates to tectonic setting either on a basin margin platform or to tectonic lines within a basin. Both chalk material properties and the presence of other materials, such as flint and marl seams which affect engineering success in chalk deposits, are related to similar geological controls. Primary mass properties of bedding, fracturing and pore-fluid escape structures also result from similar geological controls, especially intra-chalk periclinal uplift (tectonic phases).",,

Pasci', 'org': 'University of Cagliari', 'orgs': ['University of Cagliari']}]","This note details geological mapping of a broad area situated in northern Sardinia which encompasses the historic regions of Logudoro and Mejlogu. The whole area lies within a well characterized Miocene tectonic depression, hereafter called Logudoro basin. The Logudoro basin first developed as a NNW-trending half-graben in which the Upper Burdigalian transgression led to a shallow-water sequence that onlaps the volcanic substratum and is erosionally truncated at its upper boundary. Serravallian sandstones generally overlie the shallow-water sequence, and represent the base of a second sequence that includes deposits as young as Tortonian-Messinian. These two main sequences, first identified around Florinas (Mazzei & Oggiano, 1990), have now been documented all over northern Sardinia. The older sequence consists of shallow water limestones and sandstones at its base, followed by marls of a deep marine environment. The younger sequence consists of basal fluviatile-marine sandstones followed by inner-shelf, calcareous algae-bearing, limestones. Tectonic movements have been demonstrated between the two sequences. Tectonism generated differential uplift and, in places, led both to erosion of sediments of the first sequence and to deposition of continental to transitional siliciclastic sediments. The Logudoro basin appears essentially codirectional with respect to the more northerly Porto Torres basin (Thomas & Gennesseaux, 1986), to which it is linked, by a complex transfer zone. The structural development of the Logudoro basin, and more generally of the NNW-trending, fault-bounded troughs of northern Sardinia, is subsequent to and independent of tectonic activity that generated ENE-trending transtensive troughs with Oligocene-Aquitanian fill, such as the coastal Anglona, Ottana and Chilivani-Berchidda basins (Oggiano et alii, 1995). This independence concerns both structural directions and the whole tectono-sedimentary history. Hence the structural and stratigraphic evidences derived from our mapping of the Logudoro area indicate a Cenozoic tectono-sedimentary evolution typical of an intracratonic basin. Spatial and chronological relationships among the Logudoro basin and adjacent Oligocene-Aquitanian basins lead us to reject attribution of the volcanic and sedimentary infilling of these basins to a unique Oligo-Miocene rifting phase previously thought to have generated a N-S trending trough (Sardinian Rift Auct.)",,

 on loamy marl using pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS). For whole soils, the Py-FI mass spectra indicated
 clear changes in the molecular-chemical composition during SOM formation from grass residues. In particular, the enrichment
 of heterocyclic N-containing compounds with time was remarkable.
 
 For organomineral size fractions, even larger differences in the composition of SOM were found. The changes between the 13th
 and 34th experimental year are partly explained by a net transfer of phenols, lignin monomers and lignin dimers from medium
 silt to fine silt. Moreover, it is demonstrated that temperature-resolved Py-FIMS enables the determination of the thermal
 energy required for the evolution of individual compound classes which is a measure of the strength of humic- and organomineral
 bonds. At lower temperatures (< 400 °C), the enrichment of thermally less stable and/or loosely bound organic matter with
 cultivation time in clay and fine silt is due to carbohydrates, N-containing compounds, phenols and lignin monomers. Shifts
 of evolution maxima toward a higher pyrolysis temperature (> 400 °C) in clay, fine silt and medium silt are explained by a
 higher thermal stability of humic and/or organomineral bonds of lignin dimers, alkylaromatics and lipids, that developed during

The high B contents have been detected in this area, not only near the shoreline, where seawater intrusion occurs, but also in the inland part of the basin. Multi isotope ( 2 H, 18 O, 34 S, 18 O (SO4) , 11 B, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) data from borehole and thermal water springs allow identification of the possible B sources. The B dissolved in groundwater in the Chalkidiki area is mainly geogenic. The low δ 11 B values, 0–1‰, similar to those of thermal fluids from continental geothermal fields, and the low Cl/B ratio compared to seawater both indicate a geothermal origin for B and reflect deep circulation and interaction with igneous rocks. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio also indicates that the deep-aquifer granodiorite is the predominant rock source of Sr, while the shallow limestone unit has negligible effects on the dissolved Sr budget in these thermal karst waters which O and H isotopes show to be of meteoric origin. The main source of high B in borehole water is mainly mixing with B-rich geothermal water. The mixing between geothermal water and water from the Neogene aquifer is also reflected by isotopic contents of SO 4 . 1 Introduction Oxygen, H and S isotopic studies have been widely applied to define the origin of water and solutes in groundwater and geothermal fluids, Sr and B isotopic studies have not been as extensively utilized. So, B and Sr isotopes are the most recent geochemical tools used in hydrogeochemical investigations. In general, B and Sr are relatively easily mobilized into aqueous fluids during water–rock reactions. However B is not conservative in groundwater: B contents change as a consequence of water–rock interaction, mixing with waters of different origin and addition of contaminants. Boron has two stable isotopes, 10 B and 11 B and B isotope fractionation is controlled by the pH-dependent partition between the trigonal B species, undissociated boric acid B(OH) 3 and the tetrahedral anions, B ( OH ) 4 - . At equilibrium, the 11 B/ 10 B ratio is about 20‰ higher in B(OH) 3 than B ( OH ) 4 - ( Kakihana et al., 1977; Zeebe, 2005 ). Recent studies have shown that this fractionation can be as high as 27–30‰ ( Liu and Tossel, 2005; Zeebe, 2005 ). The large isotopic variation (90‰) ( Coplen et al., 2002 ) of B, which is recognized in natural reservoirs makes δ 11 B a potential tool for tracing the origin of dissolved salts in groundwater. Boron concentration in most groundwater is less than 1 mg L −1 ; higher concentrations in natural waters are attributed to hydrothermal action ( Hem, 1985 ), evaporative concentration, intrusion of seawater, residual seawater, dissolution of evaporites ( Hem, 1985 ), mineral weathering ( McArthur et al., 2001 ), human pollution ( Barth, 1998; Vengosh et al., 1998 ) and the process of sorption and de-sorption of B to mineral surfaces ( Ravenscroft and McArthur, 2004 ). Variations of Sr isotope ratios are also a powerful geochemical tracer and used here to support the B isotope studies. In general, weathering causes rocks to release Sr into natural waters. Since no processes fractionate the Sr isotopes, variations in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios reflect the mixing of Sr from different sources with various isotopic compositions ( Negrel, 1999; Negrel et al., 2001; Barbieri and Morotti, 2003 ). In fresh surface water, precipitation, pollution and the weathering of rocks are the major sources ( Sharp et al., 2002; Soler et al., 2002; Jiang et al., 2009 ). In groundwater, water–rock interaction is an important agent for controlling the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio ( Negrel, 1999; Negrel et al., 2001 ). Also the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr has been used recently as an important tool for hydrogeochemical studies of karst-water systems ( Dogramaci and Herczeg, 2002; Katz and Bullen, 1996; Wang et al., 2006 ). The study area is located in the western part of Chalkidiki province, 50 km SE of Thessaloniki, stretching S-SE from Katsika Mountain to the coastal area ( Fig. 1 ). Katsika Mountain and the area of Petralona are karstic regions of high relief, in contrast to the coastal area of Nea Moudania-Flogita-Nea Plagia, which is flat. This area of Chalkidiki is characterized by the presence of thermal water springs. This study is focused on the municipality of Nea Triglia and covers a total area of 102 km 2 , with 5500 inhabitants. The thermal waters and other mineral waters have high B and As contents. The World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline value for B is 0.5 mg/L. The drinking-water standard of the European Community ( EC Directive, 1983 ) is twice the recommended value by WHO but still, in many water resources, B concentrations in ground- and surface water exceed this value, rendering such water unacceptable according to the European standards ( Dotsika et al., 2002, 2006; Katirtzoglou, 1999 ). In this area, 2–3 million m 3 of groundwater/a are rendered unusable due to the high B content. The need for significant quantities of high quality water is an important issue due to rapid urbanization and increasing touristic development of the area, making the investigation of the spatial distribution and possible source of elevated B a priority. In this study, δ 11 B and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr were used, together with the stable isotopes of water ( δ 2 H, δ 18 O) and SO 4 ( δ 34 S, δ 18 O) and major ion hydrochemistry to identify the multiple potential natural and anthropogenic sources of B in a coastal catchment dominated by karstified limestones on a crystalline basement. 2 Geological and hydrogeological overview The study area belongs geologically to the Peonia Unit ( Kockel et al., 1977; Lalechos, 1986; Syridis, 1990 ). Mesozoic limestone is the main rock type in this region, along with granites–granodiorites, which are located in the north-western part ( Monod, 1965; Ricou, 1965 ). The karst system Katsika – Petralona ( Fig. 1 ) consists of extensively fissured and karstified Jurassic limestone under thin sandstone layers. Several bauxite horizons, slightly metamorphosed, are also intercalated. This karst system developed in the sedimentary cover on top of a granitic bedrock. A discontinuity exists in the north, where the limestone overlies the granites. The bedrock formations include recrystallized limestone (100–700 m in thickness) and granodiorite–Sithonia type (zoned plagioclase anorthite 18–27%) of Mesozoic age ( Monod, 1965; Ricou, 1965 ), while the younger sediments (Tertiary to Quaternary age) have a total stratigraphic thickness of more than 2000 m. There is also diorite (zoned plagioclase anorthite 30–55%) and gabbro (zoned plagioclase anorthite 55–80%) of Mesozoic age ( Monod, 1965; Ricou, 1965 ). The southern and western boundaries are fault bounded. The limestone found in these areas dips beneath Neogene sediments, and reaches a thickness of 1500 m near the coast. The Neogene sediments include ventricular intercalations of sands, marls, grits, travertine, limestone and conglomerates ( Psilovikos et al., 1988 ). Near the Eleochoria area, there is travertine limestone of very limited extent and thickness. Previous hydrogeological investigations carried out in the Petralona-Eleochoria-Nea Tenedos area revealed that there is homogeneity of the Karst-type aquifer although many faults exist ( Papageorgakis and Koumantakis, 1978 ). The thermal (31–42 °C) karstic water flows with high pressure into the surrounding Neogene sediments due to the artesian conditions. Karstified limestone and unconsolidated sediments of the coastal basin are hydrogeologically the most interesting rocks. The groundwater flow of the karst aquifer is towards the SSE. Currently about 3.75 × 10 6 m 3 /a are discharging through the artesian borehole of Nea Tenedos to the drainage system of the unconsolidated sediments and about 1.21 × 10 6 m 3 /a are percolating underground to the aquifers of the coastal basin ( Papakonstantinou, 1987, 1993 ). 3 Sampling and analyses Groundwater samples were collected, starting in June 2001, from 32 boreholes, three springs and seawater. The criterion of sampling was the geographical distribution of wells in order to cover the main aquifer systems, the karst type groundwater (hot water, samples 8 and 14), and the porous aquifers of Neogene adjacent to the karst and the coastal aquifer. At each point, sampling took place three times at different periods of the year, in order to investigate any change in B concentration, which could be due to seawater intrusion (during summer, when over pumping occurs due to increased water need) or to agricultural inputs (fertilizers in the aquifer). The analytical scheme included field measurements of temperature, conductivity and pH. Filtered (0.45 μm), acidified (with HNO 3 1:1) water samples were collected for determination of cations and SiO 2 . Major ions (Cl − , NO 3 - , SO 4 2 - , Na + ) and Br − , B and As were determined according to standard analytical methods ( APHA, 1985 ). Samples (not acidified) were also subjected to isotopic analysis of δ 11 B, δ 18 O, δ 2 H, δ 34 S, δ 18 O ( SO 4 2 - ) and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr. The δ 18 O compositions of water in the samples were determined from CO 2 equilibrated with the water ( Epstein and Mayeda, 1953 ). The δ 2 H compositions of water were determined from the H 2 generated by the Zn-reduction method ( Coleman et al., 1982 ). The dissolved SO 4 2 - in the water samples was precipitated as BaSO 4 for the analysis of S and O isotopic compositions ( Rafter, 1957; Longinelli and Craig, 1967 ). Measurements of the isotopes in water ( δ 18 O and δ 2 H) were made at the Stable Isotope Unit, National Centre for Scientific Research “Demokritos”, Athens, Greece on a Thermo Scientific Delta V Plus mass spectrometer and at the laboratory of Isotope Hydrology and Geochemistry, University of Paris, Orsay, France. Analyses of the isotopes in dissolved SO 4 were performed at the laboratory of Isotope Hydrology and Geochemistry, University of Paris in Orsay, France. The results for δ 18 O, δ 2 H, δ 34 S, δ 18 O ( SO 4 2 - ) are expressed in the conventional notation: as δ ‰ differences from Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW) for 18 O and for 2 H; and from Canyon Diablo (CD) for 34 S. The error for δ 18 O and δ 2 H is 0.2‰, and 2‰ respectively, while for δ 34 S and δ 18 O in SO 4 it is 1‰ and 0.1‰ respectively. The δ 11 B was determined by positive ion thermal ionization mass spectrometry ( Spivack and Edmond, 1986 ) on a Finnigan MAT 261 single collector solid source mass spectrometer. Boron isolation was performed by using the Amberlite IRA-743 boron selective resin according to a method adapted from Gaillardet and Allègre (1995) . The sample was then loaded onto a Ta single filament with Cs and mannitol, and run as the Cs 2 BO 2+ ion. Values are reported on the δ scale relative to NBS951 boric acid standard where δ 11 B (in ‰) is defined as [{( 11 B/ 10 B) sample/( 11 B/ 10 B) standard} − 1] × 10 3 . The 11 B/ 10 B value obtained for the NBS951 boric acid standard after O correction was 4.04491 ± 0.00136 (2 σ , number of determinations = 13). The long-term external reproducibility based on replicate analysis is ±0.34‰. The internal error is often better than 0.2‰. For 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, chemical purification of Sr was performed using an ion-exchange column (Sr-Spec), with a total blank <0.3 ng for the entire chemical procedure. After chemical separation, around 150 ng of Sr was loaded onto a W filament and determined with a Finnigan MAT 262 multiple collector mass spectrometer. The measured 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios were normalised to an 88 Sr/ 86 Sr of 0.1194 and then adjusted to the NBS 987 standard value of 0.710240. An average internal precision of ±10.10–6 (2 σ ) was obtained during this study; reproducibility of the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio measurements was tested through duplicate analyses of the NBS 987 standard and the mean value was 0.710245 ± 0.000018 (2 σ ; n = 9). The δ 11 B and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr analyses were carried out at the BRGM laboratories Orleans, France. 4 Groundwater types and processes controlling their chemical composition (seawater intrusion, mixing with thermal waters, water–rock interaction) The waters sampled are classified into two water types: HCO 3 and Cl groundwaters. 4.1 HCO 3 -group Thermal spring waters (Ca–HCO 3 type), semi thermal waters (Mg–Na–HCO 3 ), fresh spring waters (Ca–HCO 3 and Mg–HCO 3 type) and almost all sampled borehole waters (Mg–Ca–HCO 3 type) are included in the HCO 3 -group. The physical and chemical characteristics of the hot spring waters are related to the geothermal activity observed especially in the area of Eleochoria (sample 8) and Nea Tenedos (sample 14). The water temperature, in these thermal fluids, ranges from 31.5 to 34 °C and from 38.3 to 42 °C, respectively. The pH of the hot water, from the karstic mountain, ranges from 6.0 to 6.4. These thermal waters drain karst terrains and emerge mainly from limestone and sandstone. The dominance of Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ together with HCO 3 - (1000 mg/L) and low contents of K + and Na + can be considered as the typical characteristics of the waters in karst areas. The semi thermal waters (Mg–Na–HCO 3 -type; samples 10A, 11, 12, 13 and 28) are located in the sector of the thermal springs. The water temperature in these waters ranges from 20.5 to 24 °C and their pH is between 6 and 7.67. These groundwaters were found within the Neogene sediments, which include ventricular intercalations of sands, marls, grits, travertine, limestone and conglomerates ( Psilovikos et al., 1988 ). Probably these Mg–Na–HCO 3 waters evolve from Mg–Ca–HCO 3 groundwater after undergoing normal ion exchange, probably with the silicate minerals. The fresh spring waters (Ca–HCO 3 and Mg–HCO 3 type) [samples 9, 15A, 17, 18 (cave water) and 19], have a temperature that ranges from 23.5 to 20 °C and pH from 6.34 to 8.10. The B concentration in these waters is lower than the European drinking-water limit of 1 mg/L. All these spring waters are located north of the thermal springs. It is striking that almost all sampled waters from boreholes (Mg–Ca–HCO 3 type) in the coastal basin adjacent to the karst are also included in the group defined by the thermal spring waters. The TDS values of the HCO 3 type borehole waters are lower than 1.3 g/L and Cl − concentrations are lower than 300 mg/L, with one exception. The temperature of these borehole waters ranges from 18 to 23 °C and their pH from 5.8 to 8.3. These groundwaters are pumped from boreholes in Neogene and Quaternary alluvial sediments. The mean temperature of these borehole waters is significantly higher than the average annual air temperature (16 °C). The water temperature measurements in this coastal basin, that is adjacent to the karst, show a positive geothermal anomaly with a thermal gradient of 65–70 °C/km, twice as high as the global average (30 °C/km) ( Jackelen et al., 1986 ). This fact confirms the hydraulic connection between the two-aquifer systems, karstic and coastal. Thermal water enters the sedimentary aquifers through groundwater horizons with high permeability. The flow of the groundwater also permits the fast transmission of the temperature. 4.2 Cl-group Samples 15 (Nea Plagia) and 24 are included in the Cl-group. The TDS concentrations of Nea Plagia water (Mg–Cl type) are >2 g/L, Cl − concentrations >1000 mg/L and temperature ranges from 17 to 19 °C. This groundwater (sample 15) is pumped from a borehole in Quaternary alluvial sediments in the coastal aquifer. Sample 24 (Na–Cl type) and sample 15 have the highest Cl − contents (305 mg/L) of all waters sampled. In Fig. 2 , where the relationship of Cl − versus Na + and K + is shown, the chemical signature of all waters is characterized mainly by mixing between hydrothermal water and fresh spring water (fresh waters plot close to the intersection of the axes’). The only water sample that (for Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ Na + , K + ) does not follow this trend is sample 15. This water has a Cl − /Br − ratio similar to that of seawater suggesting partial supply of Cl − , Na + and K + ions by seawater intrusion. Also this water is “rich” in NO 3 - (approx. 160 mg/L) indicating that part of its chemical composition is controlled by human activities. In order to understand the influence of human activities on the water chemistry of sample 15, the NO 3 - contents were related to the TDS, because the marine component can be represented clearly by TDS values while, in contrast, the fresh shallow water provides NO 3 - ( Fig. 3 ). In continental areas, NO 3 - , K + and Cl − ions are mostly derived from agricultural fertilizers, animal waste and municipal and industrial sewage. A positive relationship between TDS and NO 3 - exists for the same water sample (sample 15). This water also has high B values, which are related to NO 3 - , indicating that part of the chemical composition of this water is controlled by anthropogenic impact. The products of human activities are added into this borehole water by agricultural activities. In fact, during winter the Nea Plagia water (sample 15) shows enrichment in NO 3 - contents. This fact suggests that these contents are controlled not only by seawater intrusion, due to aquifer over pumping, but also by pollutants. Fig. 2 shows that the hot springs have the highest concentration of Ca 2+ but low Mg 2+ compared to the Mg 2+ content of almost all waters sampled, indicating that the chemical composition of geothermal water has been modified by water–rock interaction at high temperature and pCO 2 ( White, 1970 ), as indicated by the high content of HCO ) 3 - . These thermal waters circulate in carbonate rocks and the enrichment in Ca 2+ is attributed to dissolution of carbonates. However, the karst system is built up on bedrock, which in this area consists by granodiorite–Sithonia type (zoned plagioclase anorthite 18–27%), diorite (zoned plagioclase anorthite 30–55%) and by gabbro (zoned plagioclase anorthite 55–80%) of Mesozoic age ( Monod, 1965; Ricou, 1965 ). Therefore, it is possible that part of Ca 2+ may come from the dissolution of detrital Ca-bearing plagioclase, which is located in the aquifer matrix. Petrographic observations prove that a part of Ca 2+ has been mobilized by plagioclase dissolution ( Milliken et al., 1989 ). Further support for the role of plagioclase dissolution in the Ca 2+ concentration in thermal waters is possibly provided by the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (see Section 7.3 ). In Fig. 4a , the co-variation of (Na + + K + )/HCO 3 versus (Ca 2+ + Mg 2+ )/HCO 3 is shown. All waters sampled plot around the (Ca 2+ + Mg 2+ )/HCO 3 line [(Ca 2+ + Mg 2+ )/HCO 3 = 1] indicating that carbonate dissolution contributes to the water chemistry. Also the position of all samples above the cross point of the two lines [(Ca 2+ + Mg 2+ )/HCO 3 = 1 and (Na + + K + )/HCO 3 = 0.01 respectively] indicates that the weathering of silicate minerals contributes less (fresh spring water) or more (thermal waters) to the water chemistry. Moreover, in thermal waters, with enrichment of the (Na + + K + )/HCO 3 ratio, B reaches values up to 5 mg/L and this high B content plus the positive correlation observed with K + , Ca 2+ and Na + implies the occurrence of cation exchange processes with rocks. This suggests that weathering of silicate minerals contributes to the thermal water chemistry. Sample 15 shows excess of both (Ca 2+ + Mg 2+ ) and (Na + + K + ) over HCO 3, which may not be ascribed to weathering of silicate or carbonate minerals. As described above, seawater intrusion and anthropogenic inputs may well have contributed to the excess of cations in this water. In order to associate the water circulation with limestone, dolomite and silicate rocks, the co-variation of Mg/Ca and Na/Ca molar ratios of the waters are illustrated in Fig. 4b . In all waters sampled, Mg/Ca ratios vary from 0.1 to 5, while Na/Ca ratios vary from 0.5 to 9. The fresh spring waters (samples 9, 15A, 17 and 19) which have B concentration lower than the European drinking-water limit of 1 mg/L, delimit the two poles of waters that circulate in limestone and dolomite. The thermal waters show excess Na/Ca ratio, confirming that these waters contact crystalline rocks and the weathering of silicate minerals control their water chemistry too. All the other waters are found between the three poles: limestone, dolomite and silicate rocks. It is also noticeable that the Mg/Ca ratios of the hot spring waters, from the karst aquifer, are below the line Mg/Ca = 0.8 ( Appelo and Postma, 1993 ). This is probably due to simultaneous equilibration of the spring waters with the calcite and dolomite, because the water equilibrates with calcite and dolomite under room temperature, giving an ideal molar Mg/Ca ratio of about 0.8. The saturation index of thermal waters shows an equilibration of the hot spring waters with calcite and dolomite. Further, the temperature of these hot springs ranges from 31 to 42 °C and this probably also explains the low Mg/Ca ratio because in thermal water the “impoverishment” of Mg 2+ probably is due to the fact that Mg 2+ moves from the liquid phase to the solid phase ( White, 1970 ) in the geothermal field. In fact, the temperature of deep hot karstic waters, Eleochoria and Nea Tenedos (samples 8 and 14), shows a probable reservoir temperature around 100 °C, estimated according to various chemical and isotopic geothermometers ( Dotsika et al., 2002 ). Based on the co-variation of Mg/Ca and Na/Ca ratios, it seems that almost all waters show that circulation in limestone, dolomite and silicate rocks affects their chemical composition. 5 Isotopic composition of water The diagram of δ 18 Ο versus δ 2 Η values is shown in Fig. 5 . In the same diagram, the global meteoric water line (GMWL) ( Craig, 1961 ) is marked. In general the isotopic values of all waters sampled are very uniform and are typical of precipitation in North Greece ( Leontiadis et al., 1984, 1996; Dotsika et al., 2009 ). The corresponding least square regression equation for these waters is: (1) δ 2 H = 6.7 δ 18 O + 0.5 Eq. (1) indicates an average slope of 6.7. Generally, an isotope relationship between δ 2 H and δ 18 O with a slope of about 6–8 is normal for fresh precipitation of all types ( Craig, 1961 ), as well as for surface water not subjected to excessive evaporation relative to input. The stable isotope contents of all sampled waters show variations of δ 18 O ranging from −9.31‰ to −5.9‰ and δ 2 H from −61.5‰ to −42.1‰. The maximum value is observed for sample 15 (Nea Plagia) and sample 24, due to seawater participation. The most negative value was measured in water sample 10A. The thermal waters (samples 8 and 14) have approximately the same isotopic signature as the fresh spring waters (samples 9, 15A, 17 and 19), indicating their purely meteoric origin. Also, these thermal waters are not more enriched in δ 18 O with respect to fresh waters, suggesting that δ 18 Ο is not modified by the exchange with rocks, and therefore that the reservoir temperature is not very high. The δ 18 Ο and δ 2 Η values of the rest of waters ( Table 1 ), range between the saline samples, 15 and 24, and sample 10A, that circulates only in the Neogene sediments and as it seems, does not receive hot water from the karstic limestone aquifer. Therefore, if samples 15 and 24 are excluded, the position of all samples in this diagram confirms their meteoric origin. However some groundwater samples from the Neogene aquifer are depleted in 18 Ο and 2 Η compared to thermal water (maximum 2‰ in δ 18 O and 13‰ in δ 2 H), differences that could reflect different recharge altitudes. According to typical isotopic gradients (about 0.3‰ in 18 Ο and 2.4‰ in 2 Η per 100 m), recharge altitude would vary by about 600 m. This is possible, considering the mountainous nature of the Chalkidiki area, which reaches an altitude of 800 m in the Holomontas massif, about 20 km NNE of Katsika mountain. Particularly, sample 10A with the most negative value of δ 18 O is the one with a low concentration of B, despite the fact that it is located between Nea Tenedos and Eleochoria. This fact probably reflects recharge at higher altitudes in the north. The Cl-type water (N° 15, 24) in the coastal areas is enriched in 18 O and 2 H as a result of seawater intrusion in agreement with the chemical data. Based on the stable isotopes–Cl relationships, balance equations can be used to determine the marine contribution for sample 15, which is the most saline water in the area. The same type of balance equation can also be performed using only the Cl − contents, with the assumption that Cl − is provided only by the marine component. These three balances give very similar results: 18 O–Cl − = 0.8%, 2 H–Cl − = 0.8% and Cl − balance = 0.9%. 6 Geochemical characterization of the potential boron and saline sources: the relationship of Cl/Br and B/Cl ratios The origin of B in the karstic and coastal aquifers in the West Chalkidiki area is yet unresolved. The potential sources of salinity and B in the aquifers of the study area could be the following: seawater intrusion, hydrothermal waters, anthropogenic sources and a combination of the above. Among them, the anthropogenic input is considered less important as in the study area, the population is low (<5000), and the main occupation is cattle-raising, with no intensive crop growing activity. Also, the main use of B compounds is in cleaning agents, (thus B is present at high concentrations in wastewater), that may cause local pollution but have minimal widespread impact on B concentrations ( Ravenscroft and McArthur, 2004 ). In the study area, the high B concentration is observed near the geothermal site of Eleochoria and Nea Tenedos, where there are no inhabitants. Also (except for sample 15) very low NO 3 - is present in thermal waters and in general (in all samples) there is no correlation between B and NO 3 , indicating that human influence is insignificant. In order to evaluate the origin of dissolved B in thermal and fresh water and its saline source, the soluble ions (Cl, Br), the rock-forming elements (B, Sr) in combination with the B, Sr and S isotopes were used. The distinction between soluble ions and rock-forming elements is used in order to evaluate the origin of the thermal karst water. The Cl/Br ratio of these thermal waters can also be used to distinguish marine and non-marine sources because Cl − and Br − are considered as conservative ions, even in geothermal environments. The Cl/Br ratio ( Fig. 6 , Table in on-line appendix ) of the samples is homogeneous and for some of them (2, 7, 9, 10, 10A, 11, 12, 15, 24) close to mean seawater (molar Cl/Br ratio of local seawater is 310), indicating that Cl − and Br − derive mainly from seawater. However, given the low salinity of most of the samples (ex. 2, 7, 9, 10, 10A, 11, 12) it is difficult to distinguish whether this characteristic is due to seawater intrusion or to the contribution of marine aerosols to meteoric water recharging the system. Seawater intrusion is evident only for the water from Nea Plagia (sample 15) which is characterized by a Cl/Br ratio (328–338) similar to that of seawater and by Cl concentrations four times higher than in the rest of the coastal aquifer. The Cl/Br ratio of geothermal waters (samples 8 and 14) is different from the Cl/Br ratio of seawater. Regarding the rest of the waters, Fig. 6 (Cl − versus Br − ) shows that the chemical signature of almost all borehole groundwater is characterized mainly by mixing with hydrothermal water. The binary plot of Cl − and B ( Fig. 7a ) indicates a mixing between a member with high temperature and B contents (thermal springs) and a low-salinity bicarbonate component with low B content. The low-salinity component comprises waters with a B concentration lower than the European drinking-water limit of 1 mg/L, both borehole waters, cave waters and fresh spring waters. The fresh water samples 9, 15A and 19 represent the very low salinity HCO 3 component with low B (<0.2 mg/L) and very low Cl − (<30 mg/L) contents. All fresh spring waters (9, 15A, 17, 18 and 19) are located west and east of Katsika Mountain and north of the thermal springs, whereas the drainage of the thermal springs takes place towards the south, into the Neogene sediments. Among the waters that represent the low salinity HCO 3 component with low B content, samples 10A, 11, 12 and 13 are semi thermal waters that have low B concentrations compared to the average of thermal waters. These samples circulate only in the Neogene sediments (sediments of great thickness due to horsts, Xanthopoulos, 1992 ) which include ventricular intercalations of sands, marls, grits, travertine, limestone and conglomerates ( Psilovikos et al., 1988 ) and probably do not receive hot waters from the karstic limestone. Almost all the other waters are located between these two poles: thermal and fresh water. In fact, a strong influence of B in hot karstic waters (samples 8 and 14) is also shown for many samples ( Fig. 7a ). Specifically, starting from a value around 0.04 mg/L, two divergent trends appear: one is that of the thermal water and the other is that of samples 15 and 24. In the first trend the B concentration of the groundwater increases up to 0.5 mmol/L, while in the case of samples 15 and 24 the B concentration reaches 0.3 mmol/L. All the deep borehole waters are located on the first trend (left trend in Fig. 7a ), together with the hot spring waters, which are on the top of this trend, suggesting the influence of geothermal Β in deep borehole waters. The second trend (right trend in Fig. 7a ) with a lower slope, which is determined by brackish waters (mainly sample 15), seems to have been moved parallel to the x -axis due to the increase of Cl − . This fact suggests seawater admixture, however an additional B source is necessary to explain the B excess with respect to conservative mixing. Also, all the waters show Cl/B ratios lower than the measured seawater value of 4350, suggesting a different, non-marine, origin for both elements. In fact in the geothermal waters the distribution of Cl − and B can be explained by water–rock interaction and soil. When the fresh parent water (in fresh waters Cl/B ratios are similar to those of seawater or somewhat lower) in the geothermal fluid reacts with the rock and gains heat through deep convection, it dissolves Cl − and B from the rock and its Cl/B ratio becomes lower because the rock is characterized by a lower Cl/B ratio (basalts and granites have a ratio of 50–150, Arnorsson et al., 1995 ) than seawater. Consequently, the Cl/B ratio in thermal water gradually becomes similar to the rock, due to rock weathering. In fact, in the diagram Cl versus Cl/B ( Fig. 7b ), where the B addition from rocks and seawater is actually shown, the two members are distinguished: fresh water and thermal water. As expected, the lowest of Cl/B ratios are encountered in semi thermal and thermal waters. The B excess with respect to Cl − can be explained by water–rock interaction with B-bearing mineral phases (mainly encountered in crystalline rocks and only minor in carbonates) and subsequent mixing either with seawater ( Fig. 4b inset), giving the water of sample 15 or with meteoric waters (15A, 19, 18) (expected to have a Cl/B ratio close to seawater) giving the other water samples. Thus, from the data so far, the potential source of B in the study area is related mainly to the supply of meteoric water and to the interaction of thermal water with the aquifer matrix. Seawater intrusion and pollution represent only minor localized contributions of B. 7 B, S and Sr isotopes 7.1 Isotopic composition of dissolved boron In order to facilitate the discussion of δ 11 B variations, literature values for typical ranges of B isotopes in different environments are illustrated in Fig. 8 a. Each of these sources has distinctive B isotopic compositions: granites, fresh oceanic basalts and non-desorbable (fixed) B in clay minerals have a δ 11 B value of 0‰ (−5‰ to 5‰), altered oceanic basalts have a δ 11 B value of 0–9‰ and desorbable B, leached from marine clay minerals, has a δ 11 B of 13.9–15.8‰ ( Spivack et al., 1987; Ishikawa and Nakamura, 1993; Vengosh et al., 1994 ). Modern marine carbonate sediments have a δ 11 B of 14.2–32.2‰ ( Vengosh et al., 1994 ). Boron isotopic compositions of fluids also have different values. The isotopic value of B in the ocean is 39‰ ( Spivack and Edmond, 1987; Vengosh et al., 1992 ), while the δ 11 B of volcanic gases ( Fig. 8 a) ranges between 1.5‰ and 6.5‰ ( Kanzaki et al., 1979 ). Representative studies of δ 11 B in rain (0.8–35‰) became available only recently after some early studies ( Spivack, 1986 ), estimated a wide range of values. Chetelat et al. (2005) found a range of 33.9–44.8‰ for coastal rains in French Guiana with a weighted mean of 41 ± 3.5‰ and concluded a marine origin of B and a slight enrichment in 11 B due to kinetic fractionation during evaporation. Mather and Porteous (2001) measured comparable values (38–42‰) in Southern England (Guildford) but a much larger range for rains on the Isle of Wight (−13‰ to 24‰). Rose-Koga et al. (2006) measured two coastal rain samples from California (19.8‰ and 26‰) and continental rains and snows (−10‰ to +34‰). Rainwater from Germany was measured to have a δ 11 B equal to 13‰ ( Eisenhut and Heuman, 1997 ). In hydrothermal fluids the δ 11 B is close to 0‰ (−10‰ to 10‰) ( Palmer and Sturchio, 1990; Musashi et al., 1988 ). In continental waters, the upper limit of δ 11 B is 59‰, observed in Australian lakes ( Vengosh et al., 1991 ) and the lower limit of −27‰ observed in the Cecina River, Italy ( Pennisi et al., 2006 ). The δ 11 B of fresh groundwater is determined by a mixture of weathering B derived from aquifer rock (low δ 11 B) and B provided from marine aerosols (high δ 11 B). Subsurface brine has a large range of δ 11 B values according to the origin of the brine and interaction with sediments ( Vengosh et al., 1994 ). In general, the 11 B contents ( Fig. 8 a) of the main B reservoirs are 4–58‰ for marine B; −31‰ to 26‰ for non-marine B; −17‰ to −2‰ for igneous B and −34‰ to 22‰ for metamorphic B ( Vengosh et al., 1994; Pennisi et al., 2006 ). Boron compounds are also used in fertilizers and in pesticides, which results in an increase of the B contents of groundwater. The δ 11 B in fertilisers is between −15‰ and 7.5‰ ( Vengosh et al., 1994, 1998 ). The δ 11 B of synthetic Na-borate is −0.4‰ to 7.5‰ while the δ 11 B of natural Na-borate minerals is −0.9‰ to 10.5‰ ( Vengosh et al., 1994, 1998 ). In contrast, the δ 11 B of synthetic Ca-borate products are low, −15‰ to −12‰ and overlap with those of the natural Ca-borate minerals ( Vengosh et al., 1994 ). All waters sampled in the present study had δ 11 B in the range from −1.62‰ to 28.96‰. In order to determine the origin of B, the relationships between the Β/Cl ratio and δ 11 B contents of the water sampled, as well as the domain of seawater, the domain of geothermal fluids ( Vengosh et al., 1994 ), the domain of the coastal aquifer and the domain of sewage-contaminated groundwater are illustrated in Fig. 9a . In this diagram, the poles highlighted by the water chemistry are easily recognized from the δ 11 B: fresh spring water, sample 9, thermal spring water, samples 8 and 14, semi thermal water, samples 10, 11, 12, 13 and finally the saline member, sample 15. The highest B contents (around 6 mg/L) associated with a low δ 11 B (0.50‰) were observed in the thermal waters. The B concentration of thermal waters (Cl − around 200 mg/L), as mentioned above, is not related to mixing with seawater. This is also shown by the large B excess with respect to the mixing line with seawater (B versus Cl − ). Moreover, the influence of seawater B in geothermal systems could also be traced by the δ 11 B values ( δ 11 B = −6.7‰ to 30.7‰; Musashi et al., 1988; Aggarwal et al., 1992 ). If the δ 11 B values of hot waters derived from hydrothermal fluids of meteoric origin, circulating only in marine carbonate formations, they would range from 20‰ to 30‰ ( Vengosh et al., 1992, 1991 ). In the karst hot system, the δ 11 B value in thermal water is 0‰. These δ 11 B values are similar to those of thermal fluids from continental geothermal fields that have low δ 11 B values, as in the Salton Sea, California ( δ 11 B = −2.6‰ to −1.1‰) and in Yellowstone National Park ( δ 11 B = −9.3‰ to 4.4‰; B = 0.4–29 mg/L) ( Palmer and Sturchio, 1990 ) and they indicate a non carbonate source of B. The δ 11 B values of fresh spring water, sample 9, are similar to those of thermal fluids suggesting the same B source. Most borehole waters, except for samples 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15, have δ 11 Β similar to those of thermal waters, suggesting that B in these waters has a geothermal origin, as mentioned above (Cl − versus B). Samples 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15, having different B isotope signatures from those of thermal water, define a different domain/pole from that of geothermal fluids. Starting from the thermal pole, all waters plot inside a mixing field defined by two members, as can be seen in Fig. 9a . One trend is clearly related to geothermal input and has a value of 0‰ and Β/Cl ratio equal to 0.1 and to seawater (and perhaps a small anthropogenic contribution, sample 15) with δ 11 B = 39‰ and Β/Cl ratio = 0.001. This trend is mainly related to sample 15, which shows an increase of δ 11 B and B/Cl ratio compared to geothermal water. For this sample, seawater intrusion is indicated by the Cl/Br ratio, by the δ 2 H– δ 18 O relationship and also by the correlation δ 11 B-1/B ( Fig. 9b ). The anthropogenic input in sample 15 is indicated by the correlation TDS–NO 3 . The second trend is again related to geothermal input and also to waters from the Neogene sediments that are characterized by the highest δ 11 B (sample 11). This trend is mainly related to samples 10, 11, 12 and 13 that are enriched in 11 B with respect to thermal waters. It is also remarkable that these waters (10, 11, 12 and 13) found in the area of Eleochoria and Nea Tenedos (samples 8 and 14) have high 11 B contents in contrast to those in the close vicinity, (Nea Teledos, Eleochoria) where low 11 B concentrations were found. Geophysical research ( Xanthopoulos, 1992 ) has demonstrated that there are horsts and grabens in the study area. In particular, karstic limestone was traced in the Eleochoria area at 100 m depth while limestone found at Nea Tenedos, is more superficial. Due to a graben (>400 m) found between these two areas, the limestone is located at greater depth. Furthermore, there are granodiorites in Eleochoria, under the karstic limestone. The model that could explain this phenomenon is that the meteoric water goes deep into the limestone and the granodiorite, where it is enriched with B and increases its temperature. This hydrothermal karstic water is pumped at Eleochoria and Nea Tenedos (boreholes 8 and 14). On the other hand, the semi thermal borehole waters, 10, 11, 12, 13 (their borehole depth is approximately 150 m) are recharged from the Neogene sediments, which include ventricular intercalations of sands, marls, grits, travertine, limestone and conglomerates ( Psilovikos et al., 1988 ), which fill the graben. However, due to the great thickness of these sediments, the borehole waters do not circulate in the karstic limestone. The fact that the waters from these boreholes circulate mainly in the Neogene sediments, sand and carbonates is confirmed by the enrichment of δ 11 B (and confirmed by their 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios, Section 7.3 ). The poles “geothermal inputs – Neogene sediments” which are represented by thermal (samples 8 and 14) and semi thermal water (samples 10, 11, 12, 13) are indicated also by the correlation δ 11 B-1/B ( Fig. 9b ). 7.2 δ 34 S of sulfate Bacterial SO 4 2 - reduction in marine sediments removes SO 4 2 - from the world’s oceans and fixes S as sulfide in the sediment. This process involves a large S isotopic fractionation that leaves marine SO 4 2 - enriched in 34 S ( δ 34 S = +20‰ at the present day and a range from +15‰ to +27‰ in ancient marine evaporites) while sedimentary reduced S has a wide range of generally negative δ 34 S, averaging about −12‰ (e.g. Bottrell and Newton, 2006 ). Thus the δ 34 S of sediments varies, depending on the form(s) of S present and the ratio of oxidized to reduced S. In Fig. 10 , 34 S versus 1/SO 4 is shown, where 34 S contents of the samples are compared to those of local marine SO 4 2 - , which is very constant over the world [ δ 34 S = 20‰ CDT, δ 18 Ο = 9.5‰ versus SMOW ( Longinelli, 1989 )]. Thermal karstic waters (Eleochoria and Nea Tenedos) contain SO 4 2 - that is depleted in heavy isotopes relative to marine SO 4 2 - . The isotopic contents of 34 S and 18 O of SO 4 2 - are 13.8‰ versus CDT and 5.1‰ versus SMOW, respectively, for Eleochoria water ( Dotsika, 1991 ) and 12.6‰ versus CDT and 5.7‰ versus SMOW for Nea Tenedos water. Seawater does not seem to be involved. In Fig. 10 , a mixing between geothermal water and water from the Neogene aquifer is also shown. Unfortunately, there is no isotopic analysis of 34 S for sample 15, in which seawater participation is certain, in order to ascertain whether part of the SO 4 2 - comes from dissolved marine SO 4 2 - . 7.3 Isotopic composition of dissolved strontium In Fig. 8 b, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios and several ranges from the literature are given. Carbonate sources have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values between 0.7068 and 0.7094, depending on their age ( Negrel and Roy, 1998; Brass, 1976 ). In silicate sources, i.e. granite and gneiss, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios range between 0.7135 and 0.717 ( Negrel et al., 1988, 1989; Negrel and Roy, 1998 ). The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in deep groundwater from Vienne (France) granitoids range from 0.7077 to 0.71126 (0.7–1.12 μmol/L; Negrel et al., 2001 ). For basalts, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios range between 0.703 and 0.705 ( Negrel and Deschamps, 1996 ). Strontium isotopic data from separate minerals in granitic rocks are given in Negrel et al. (2001) : 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in apatite and plagioclase range between 0.70451 and 0.70679; in K-feldspar it is 0.70880; in biotite they range between 0.73428 and 0.745491; in whole rocks the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios range between 0.70503 and 0.70704. The anthropogenic influence on 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios is also evident: fertilizers and de-icing salts contain very large contents of Sr (3–1500 ppm) and the isotopic ratio ranges between 0.70794 and 0.70950. The carbonate amendments used in agriculture have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios around 0.70987 ( Negrel et al., 2001 ). In rainwater, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios are around 0.709 and 0.7106 (0.012–0.04 μmol/L). In seawater, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios are around 0.709 ( Negrel et al., 2001 ). Strontium isotopic data and Sr contents are given in Table 1 and Table in on-line appendix . The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of all waters sampled ranged between 0.70789 and 0.71032. The hot waters have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios between 0.70789 and 0.70790 while all the other waters sampled have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios between 0.70798 and 0.71032. The difference observed can be explained mainly by the difference in the nature of the weathered rocks. In the diagram with 87 Sr/ 86 Sr versus 1/Sr ( Fig. 11a ) the domain of anthropogenic sources, seawater, rainwater, karstic water and the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of granodiorite, limestone and sand are reported ( Negrel et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2006 ). The Sr isotopic signature in all waters, except from thermal water springs, indicates an origin related to the siliciclastic materials and carbonate sediments (Neogene and Quaternary alluvial deposits). The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios increase from around 0.708, which is observed in groundwater from alluvial deposits, to a maximum value (0.70975–0.71032) which is measured in the groundwater that was circulating in the Neogene basin (10, 11, 12 and 13 samples). In the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr– 11 B diagram ( Fig. 11b ) it is clearly shown that the δ 11 B and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of these waters (10, 11, 12, 13) are related to carbonate and silicate rocks probably indicating the weathering of sand ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0.711; Wang et al., 2006 ). In fact, if these semi thermal waters circulated only in carbonate rocks, it would be expected that the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio would be 0.708–0.709 ( Negrel and Roy, 1998 ) and the δ 11 B would range between 20‰ and 30‰ ( Vengosh et al., 1991, 1992 ). In contrast, if they circulated only in silicate rocks, these waters would have δ 11 B = 0‰ and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios >0.71 ( Negrel and Roy, 1998 ). In the karst aquifers, the Sr inputs in recharge water are derived mainly from rainwater ( Fig. 11a inset). Thus, if the interaction between rock and recharge waters controlled the Sr hydrochemistry, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of karst waters in the discharge area could reflect this process. The meteoric input is very dilute with respect to Sr and shows a 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio that is close to the range observed from karstic waters in Jurassic deposits ( Negrel et al., 2001 ). The low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signature of hot waters could reflect interaction with carbonate rocks ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0.708, Negrel et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2006 ). In this case, if the waters circulate totally in these carbonate rocks, they would have low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio (0.708) and a positive correlation between Sr and Ca elements should occur, as found by Gunn et al. (2006) for deep thermal waters that circulated entirely within karst. This is not observed in the present case. Moreover, the water chemistry and B isotopes showed that these thermal waters circulated in crystalline rocks. The low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio (0.707) in the thermal aquifer is attributed to the circulation of thermal water in granodiorite, providing the enrichment in Sr and B, which then emerges very rapidly through carbonate rocks. Thus, the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio and Sr contents of geothermal waters from karst aquifers of Elechoria and Nea Tenedos probably have resulted from the interaction between rainwater and granodiorite ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0.707; Negrel et al., 2001 ). In fact, during water-granitoid interaction, the dissolution of plagioclase takes place more rapidly than the dissolution of K-feldspar and micas ( Lasaga, 1984 ). Moreover, the reaction time between plagioclase and water in open systems is short and thus the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signature of water reflects the dissolution by hydrolysis of plagioclase with a low isotopic ratio ( Smalley et al., 1988; Franklyn et al., 1991; Negrel et al., 2001 ). Therefore, the dissolution of K-feldspar and micas cannot be considered significant and hence the dissolution of Ca-plagioclase, with low Sr isotopic ratio (0.704, Negrel et al., 2001 ) imposes the isotopic signature on the waters. It should be noted that the granodiorite of the study area, which appears NW of Katsika Mountain ( Fig. 2 ) is characterized by strong presence of plagioclase. Fig. 11a shows an increase of Sr content in coastal groundwaters (samples 15 and 2) compared to rain water but also shows similar Sr isotopic ratios that may reflect the influence of seawater. This limited influence of seawater is also observed in the diagrams Br–Cl, δ 2 H– δ 18 O, δ 11 Β-B/Cl and δ 11 Β-1/B. However, this water is suspected to be for polluted because it shows NO 3 - values higher than 150 mg/L, with relatively high SO 4 contents. The high NO 3 concentrations would appear to suggest that this water is mixed not only with seawater but with agriculture return flow. Due to the mixing with seawater, the B/Cl ratio of sample 15 is lower, while δ 11 B (11.95), 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0.709388) and SO 4 increase. Therefore, if there was no mixing, this water would possibly have lower δ 11 B and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values than 11.95 and 0.709388, respectively. Low values of both δ 11 B and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, associated with relatively a high B/Cl ratio (3 to 4 × 10 −3 ) ( Vengosh et al., 1991 ) are attributed to agriculture return flow ( Horan and Bohlke, 1996 ). So, it is probable that seawater intrusion and pollution have competing roles in the chemical and isotopic composition of this water (Nea Plagia). 8 Conclusions Chemical and multi isotope data from fresh and semi thermal borehole waters, spring fresh waters and geothermal karstic spring waters, sampled from the western area of Chalkidiki, are presented in this paper. The very-low-salinity fresh component, with low B and very low Cl − content of the study area, is represented mainly by the fresh spring waters, samples 9, 15A and 19. The thermal spring waters, with high temperature and B content, are represented by Eleochoria and Nea Tenedos (samples 8 and 14). The chemical composition of these geothermal waters has been modified by water–rock interaction at high temperature and pCO 2 . The B excess with respect to Cl − contents might reflect interactions with the hydrothermal reservoir matrix. The saline component, with high Cl − , B and NO 3 contents, represented mainly by samples 15 and 24, is due to seawater intrusion caused by overexploitation of the aquifers. The influence of human activities on the water (sample 15) chemistry is showed by the increase of NO 3 , suggesting that fertilisers or sewage could contribute to the B budget. The B and Sr isotopes of thermal spring waters show a clear influence from weathering rock, mainly of silicate basement. The δ 11 B values of thermal waters are 0‰, similar to those of thermal fluids from continental geothermal fields, and reflect deep circulation and interaction with igneous rocks. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of the geothermal water from karst aquifers suggests that the deep aquifer units are the predominant rock sources of Sr while the shallow limestone unit has negligible effects on the dissolved Sr budget in the thermal karst waters. The δ 11 B values and Sr isotopes of fresh spring water, sample 9, are similar to those of thermal fluids suggesting the same B and Sr source. In the borehole water, the δ 11 B values in general exhibit three increasing trends in relation to the thermal water, reflecting different B sources: One is clearly related to geothermal inputs, samples 8 and 14, with δ 11 B = 0‰ and Β/Cl ratio equal to 0.1. The second one is related to seawater intrusion, sample 15, and has a value of δ 11 B > 10‰ and Β/Cl ratio = 0.01, while the third one is related to weathering of “sand and carbonates” of Neogene age with a value of δ 11 B ≫ 10‰ and Β/Cl > 0.01. The borehole waters have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios different from those of the geothermal and fresh spring waters (samples 8, 14 and 9). This observed difference can be explained by the difference in the nature of the rocks weathered by these waters. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signature in all borehole waters indicates an origin related, as mentioned above, to the silico-clastic materials and carbonate sediments (sand of Neogene and Quaternary alluvial deposits). The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios increase from around 0.708 (in borehole water from alluvial deposits) to a maximum value (0.70975–0.71032) in the groundwater that circulated in the Neogene. In conclusion, the B dissolved in groundwater of the Chalkidiki area is geogenic, i.e. it does not derive from an anthropogenic contaminant source, but it is released from the aquifer sediments. Moreover, the distinctive isotopic composition of B sources makes B isotopes potential environmental tracers for identifying the origin of dissolved constituents and hence sources of enrichment in groundwater (natural versus anthropogenic).

Two regional, organic-rich source-rock levels occur. They comprise Upper Ordovician/Lower Silurian shales in the SE half of the country, and Upper Cretaceous, bituminous chalky marls in the western/central sectors; the former range from immature in the SW to locally over-mature in the NE, whereas the latter are mainly immature, except where deeply buried, as in the Jordan Valley/Dead Sea rift and part of the Azraq rift. Subordinate source-rock levels occur in the Triassic and Middle Cretaceous. Numerous hydrocarbon indications, including seeps and floating asphalt blocks, occur in the Dead Sea area and have been correlated with the Upper Cretaceous source rocks. In spite of these positive indications, only 13 exploration wells have been drilled since drilling first began in the mid-1950s. The Natural Resources Authority (NRA) has established modest oil and gas production in two fields, mainly through the drilling of well clusters in encouraging areas.

The main objective of this study is to investigate hydrogeochemical processes responsible for the release of Mo in the groundwater resources. Usually Mo is a metallic element that is naturally present in the earth’s crust. However, the presence of Mo in groundwater is an important potential pollution issue. To achieve the objectives of the study, 34 water samples were collected from the whole catchment area of Wadi Al Arab and were analyzed using ICP-MS for total Mo and the other major cations, anions and heavy metals. The results obtained from the hydrogeochemical investigation show that the groundwater in Wadi Al Arab catchment area is susceptible to Mo contamination due to the chemical reactions of water with clay-rich underlying bedrock that consists mainly of shale and marl rocks. The concentration values measured at the tested wells vary from 46.6 μg/L to 1438.7 μg/L, with an average value of 397.6 μg/L. Therefore, about 70% of the analyzed water samples show Mo levels that exceed the permissible limit of 70 μg/L for drinking water according to World Health Organization. The results of geochemical modeling using VISUAL MINTEQ software show that the most abundant species of Mo mineral is molybdate ion (MoO42-), with a concentration of 30 μg/L, which accounts for more than 50% of the Mo species dissolved in groundwater. The possible source of the Mo in the groundwater in Wadi Al Arab catchment area is due to presence of oil shale and phosphate layers within the geological succession of the aquifer. Through the geochemical model, the saturation indices of the common Mo minerals were calculated. The calculated saturation indices showed that groundwater is under-saturated with respect to Mo mineral speciation, which emphasizes that natural equilibrium will never be reached.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/BD/F1/2C/BDF12C29DC5AEE12F1D3992F0FB2DC60.pdf

The in situ values are below 1 MPa, many cases indicate only 0.3 M Pa or less. In anhydritic shale, where a chemical component influences swelling behaviour, swelling pressures in the range of 2–2.5 M Pa have been observed in situ. Laboratory values are usually much higher. Horizontal and lateral stresses play a major role both in laboratory and in situ tests. For in situ stresses from overconsolidation, experience from clay soil has been extrapolated to mesozoic sedimentary rock and calibrated on in situ measurements.

A description is also given of the now submerged locality. The Harder collection, which has remained virtually unstudied for more than 75 years, is discussed in the interesting historical context that it was not included in the monograph on the Paleocene of Copenhagen by J.P.J. Ravn in 1939. Ravn's study was based on material collected the same year from Sundkrogen by A. Rosenkrantz, and on material collected in the thirties from other localities in the Copenhagen area. Some material collected by A. Rosenkrantz and others, but not dealt with by J.P.J. Ravn, is also included in the present study. The long-lasting controversy about publication rights relating to the Sundkrogen material is recalled. Twenty-seven new species are introduced, viz. Portlandia (Yoldiella) nielseni n. sp., Plicatula selandica n. sp., Laternula (Laternulina) ravni n. sp., Dentalium (Dentalium) sundkrogensis n. sp., Solariella (Solariella) ravni n. sp., Solariella (Solariella) hauniensis n. sp., Teinostoma (Teinostoma) ledoni n. sp., Entomope kirstineae n. sp., Harrisianella subglabra n. sp., Bittium (Bittium) oedumi n. sp., Cerithiopsidella (Vatopsis) rasmusseni n. sp., Seila (Notoseila) heilmannclauseni n. sp., Seila (Notoseila) anderseni n. sp., Thereitis weinbrechti n. sp., Cirsotrema (Cirsotrema) hauniensis n. sp., Opalia (Pliciscala) thomseni n. sp., Charonia (Sassia) danica n. sp., Siphonalia arlejansseni n. sp., Astyris (Astyris) lappanni n. sp., Streptolathyrus danicus n. sp., Streptolathyrus lemchei n. sp., Cancellaria (sensu lato) jakobseni n. sp., Pseudocochlespira rosenkrantzi gen. et sp. n., Actaeopyramis marcusseni n. sp., Chrysallida (Parthenina) peterseni n. sp., Syrnola (Syrnola) granti n. sp. and Cingulina harderi n. sp. Within the Turridae, Pseudocochlespira n. gen. is established. A total of 182 taxons are listed. Of these, 36 are new for the Lellinge Greensand, and 60 have not previously been recorded from Sundkrogen. The study demonstrates that several genera have their first occurrence datum in the Selandian. The Selandian mollusc fauna from Sundkrogen and elsewhere in the Copenhagen area has no equivalent in the North Sea Basin, but faunas from boulders of Selandian age from the south-eastern part of Denmark and the southern part of Sweden demonstrate affinities with the Sundkrogen fauna, whereas the fauna from the Kerteminde Marl demonstrates a lesser degree of affinity. The palaeoenvironment is interpreted as a transgression of the Selandian Sea with erosion of the underlying Danian sediments. The near-shore environment was followed by gradually increasing water depth, resulting in deposits of fine-grained sand and finally dark clay.

Estimating flood loads requires appropriate sampling strategies. We applied flood-scale sampling for the survey of two rivers flowing into the Thau lagoon (France). Two bacterial indicators were considered, thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) and faecal streptococci (FC). During floods, concentrations of indicator bacteria associated with non-mineral suspended solids increased quickly with the rising flow, their decrease during the recession period was slow and erratic. Statistical analysis was performed on total bacterial flood loads measured during 20 floods, versus hydrological variables and land-use characteristics. The analysis highlighted the significant impacts of human pollution sources together with the magnitude of the flood. Regarding the results, the best linear regression models linked total bacterial flood loads to peak discharge for both TTC and FS, reinforcing the assumption that in-stream bacterial stores play an important role in the level of bacterial flood loads in Mediterranean coastal rivers. At an annual scale, between 13.9 and 16.6 log 10 cfu of TTC could be supplied depending on the hydrological conditions during the year. Over the 12 year period, from 1994 to 2006 it was shown that the flood loads were responsible for at least 98% of the TTC total annual load and in 8 of 12 years the floods contributed to at least 99.9% of the annual loads. Over the same period on average the single major flood represents 74% of the total annual load. The contribution of in-stream bacterial stores was demonstrated but spatial variations in total flood loads showed that this contribution is difficult to evaluate. Bacteria from land stores appeared to be negligible in both catchments. Keywords Faecal bacteria Flood dynamics Flood loads Statistical models Bacterial sources Land use 1 Introduction During rainfall events high enteric bacterial loads are observed in rivers. They may come from various sources. The hillslopes of a river basin are a significant bacterial reservoir, particularly in rural and pasture catchments ( Doran and Linn, 1979; Hunter et al., 1999 ). Bacterial land stores are gradually filled by the deposit of animal faeces from wild animals or from extensive breeding activities, or by the agricultural use of manure ( Crowther et al., 2002 ). These land stores are washed away by runoff during rainfall events. Large amounts of bacteria attached to soil particles are brought to the river through the drainage systems and by tributaries, as suggested by several authors ( Sinton et al., 1997; Tyrrel and Quinton, 2003; Schoonover and Lockaby, 2006 ). Overflow from sewage systems in the case of excessive volumes due to runoff on urban areas, as well as failure of septic tanks in rural zones, are the other sources of bacterial loads during rainfall events ( Al Bakri et al., 2008; Astrom et al., 2009 ). The continuous discharge of effluents from sewage treatment works (STW) also contributes significant bacterial loads ( Wainright et al., 1992; Álvarez-Salgado et al., 1993 ). Of course, improvements have been made in this domain, thanks to the strict application of European Directives as often reported in the literature ( Crowther et al., 2002; Tyrrel and Quinton, 2003 ). But these sources should nevertheless be taken into account. The final source of enteric bacterial loads that has been identified is the river-bed sediments. Bacteria bound to particulate organic matter are settled in the river-bed sediments during low flow periods ( Irvine and Pettibone, 1996; Haller et al., 2009b; Mckergow and Davies-Colley, 2010 ). Trapped in the sediment in the presence of organic matter, bacteria are able to survive or even to multiply ( Sherer et al., 1992; Smith et al., 2008 ). In-stream stores of bacteria have been highlighted by a number of authors as serious sources of contamination during floods ( Buckley et al., 1998; Crabill et al., 1999; Jamieson et al., 2004; Muirhead et al., 2004 ). For some authors, high levels of bacterial contamination during floods are mainly due to the entrainment of contaminated sediments from in-stream stores of bacteria ( Wyer et al., 1996; Nagels et al., 2002 ). Under a Mediterranean climate, all these processes are facilitated: the long dry periods that enhance accumulation processes are interrupted by short-duration rainfall events associated with intense runoff processes. As a result, Mediterranean coastal rivers are subject to flash floods that transport the majority of the annual loads of suspended solids, bacteria and other contaminants, as reported by many authors (e.g. Meybeck et al., 1992; Cherifi and Loudiki, 1999; Letcher et al., 1999 ). Baudart et al. (2000) estimated that storm events contributed to 95–99% of the annual faecal bacteria loads transported by the Tech river (France) to the Mediterranean Sea. The significant amount of pollutants released by coastal rivers in short periods of time are potentially harmful for transitional and coastal waters: the sustainability of activities such as fishing, shellfish farming and tourism may be impacted ( Wyer et al., 1996; Chigbu et al., 2005; Petersen et al., 2005; Kashefipour et al., 2006; Riou et al., 2007; Shah et al., 2007; Kay et al., 2007 ). Consequently, flood events must be carefully assessed to improve the estimate of inputs of bacteria from rivers to coastal aquatic environments in the Mediterranean context. Moreover, since high flow and flood periods are unlikely to be sampled under a regular sampling programme, specific sampling protocols are needed ( Salles et al., 2008 ). The present study focused on bacteria loads during flood events in two Mediterranean coastal rivers that have an impact on recreational activities and shellfish farming in the Thau lagoon (France), through the use of two indicator bacteria, thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) and faecal streptococci (FS). The objectives of the study were to: (i) analyze the levels and dynamics of bacterial concentrations during flood events, (ii) characterize total flood loads in relation to flood characteristics and land use descriptors, (iii) estimate the total bacterial flood loads supplied to the lagoon by the two rivers during floods at an annual scale. 2 Study sites and available data 2.1 Study sites The Thau lagoon (France) is a large brackish lagoon devoted to recreational activities and shellfish farming for which good sanitary conditions are required throughout the year. Different studies have proved that pollutants (including bacteria) mainly come from its catchment area ( Fiandrino et al., 2003; Tournoud et al., 2006 ). Our study focused on the two main rivers draining the Thau catchment: Pallas and Vène ( Fig. 1 ). The Pallas river is a typical Mediterranean intermittent river. Its 53 km 2 basin is mainly composed of marl-clay, partly filling karstic areas in the upper part (25% of the catchment area). Natural areas (46%) consist of garrigue and pine trees. Agricultural areas (52% of the catchment area) consist of vineyards (30%), market gardening, orchard, and cereals. The basin is sparsely populated and has no significant industrial activity. Point-source pollutant inputs come mainly from one winery and one sewage treatment works (STW) sized for 2000 equivalent-inhabitants. The STW uses extensive treatment ponds. The Vène river drains a superficial basin of 67 km 2 that ranges from 2 to 323 m in elevation. The catchment is divided into two main zones: (i) the central part of the basin, which covers about 40% of the total catchment area, is a flat marly plain dedicated to agriculture (mainly vineyards: 21% of the total basin area); (ii) limestone massifs on both sides are highly karstified and covered by natural garrigue used for sheep and poultry. Two intermittent karstic springs feed the river: the upper one (Spring1) is the river spring; the lower one (Spring2) is located a few hundred meters upstream from the outlet. Small urban zones (3% of the catchment area) are spread in the central zone. Point-source pollutant inputs come mainly from two wineries and three STWs, altogether sized for 9800 equivalent-inhabitants. Two STWs are extensive treatment ponds that discharge their effluents directly into the river; the third one, located in the upper basin, uses activated sludge processes. There is no disinfection process at any of the three plants. 3 Available data 3.1 Hydrological data The locations of rain and stream gauges are shown in Fig. 1 . The stream gauge in the Pallas river is located at the outlet (Pa station). Gauges in the Vène river are located at the outlet (V(R3) station), at the upper spring (V(R1) station 150 m downstream from Spring1), at an intermediate location (V(R2) station), and in its main tributary (V(T) station). The main characteristics of the sub-catchments are summarized in Table 1 . Rainfall and flow data are available at a 5 min time step. Fig. 2 presents rainfall – and discharge versus time at Pa and V(R3) stations for a typical hydrological year. Both rivers showed typical Mediterranean intermittent behavior, with long low flow periods interrupted by short floods. 3.2 Sampling and analytical protocols Regular and flood surveys were conducted at the gauging stations: from August 1993 to September 1995 at Pa and V(R3) stations, and from October 2002 to September 2006 at V(R3), V(R2), V(R1) and V(T) stations. The routine survey consisted in bi-monthly grab samples. During floods, samples were collected by an automatic sampling device. Water samples were stored in clean, sterile 1 L bottles at 4 °C. The samples were filtered at the laboratory within less than 6 h after collection. Thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) and faecal streptococci (FS) were counted, using the standard membrane filtration method with three replicates ( APHA, 1992 ). The results are expressed in colony forming units per 100 mL (cfu/100 mL). Total suspended solids (TSS) and ash free dry mass (AFDM) were measured for each sample. 3.3 Calculation of loads The “instant load at time t ” L ( t ), is the bacterial concentration at time t C ( t ), by Q ( t ) the river flow discharge at time t : (1) L ( t ) = kLC ( t ) Q ( t ) where k L , the time unit conversion factor, equals 3.6 10 7 if L , Q and C are respectively expressed in cfu/h, m 3 /s and cfu/100 mL. Total load during a flood event (TFL) was calculated following Salles et al. (2008) : (2) TFL = ∑ j = 1 m k T C int ( t j ) Q ( t j ) dt where m is the number of discharge data during the flood event; dt is the discharge data time step (here dt = 5 min) ; C int( t j ) is the linear interpolated concentration value at time t j , between the observed values C ( t i ) and C ( t i +1 ), with t i ⩽ t j < t i +1 ; k T , the unit conversion factor, equals 610 5 if TFL, Q , C int and dt are respectively expressed in cfu, m 3 /s, cfu/100 mL and min. 3.4 Statistical analysis All the bacterial concentration data were log 10 transformed prior to analysis to reduce the skewness of their distribution; the same transformation was applied to bacterial load data. All mean bacterial concentrations (or loads) reported here are geometric means, calculated as the antilog of the mean of the log 10 transformed concentrations (or loads). Relationships between mean bacterial concentrations (or loads) and explanatory variables (characteristics of catchments or/and hydrological conditions) were examined using the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson-CC). Prior to analysis, the independence of explanatory variables was verified on the basis of significant Pearson at p < 0.05. Variables with more than 25% of missing or zero values were excluded from the analysis. Statistical significance was assessed with a confidence level of 95%. 4 Results Over the whole survey, 147 samples were collected in routine and 242 samples during floods. 21 floods were correctly sampled, as recommended by Salles et al. (2008) . The events are named X#n , where X is the name of the river (i.e. Pa, V) and the numbering n refers to the rainfall event and is ordered chronologically. In the case of the Vène river the name of the river is followed by the name of the gauging station into brackets (as example V(R3) for the R3 station). The 21 floods were generated by 11 rainfall events: 3 in spring (#3, #4, #5), 6 in September (#1, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11) and 2 in autumn. Except for the events #3, #5, #7 and #11, the sampling was done at least at two gauging stations, enabling the comparison of the river response in terms of bacterial flood loads. Table 2 presents the main characteristics of the events. The floods are characterized in terms of duration (D), number of samples (NS), TTC and FS total flood loads (TTC-TFL, FS-TFL), total rainfall amount (H), peak rainfall intensity over 15 mn (PI), peak discharge (PQ), total flood volume (V), initial discharge (AQ), total rainfall amount during the 10 and 30 previous days (H-10, H-30). For a given station, the rainfall descriptors are calculated using the nearest rain gauge. Floods lasted from 3 h to 6 days. Some events presented a very low peak discharge but are representative because they occur after a long dry period with a river bed dry or nearly dry. TFL ranges from 10.98 to 14.90 log 10 cfu for TTC and from 10.83 to 14.74 log 10 cfu for FS. 4.1 Dynamics of concentrations during floods Descriptive statistics of TTC and FS concentrations observed during the routine survey and the flood events are presented in Fig. 3 , using box-and-whisker plots. Considering all flood samples together, TTC (respectively FS) concentrations varied between 1.4 (respectively 1.1) and 5.9 log10cfu/100 mL. But the arithmetic mean of faecal bacteria concentrations observed during the routine survey is about one order of magnitude lower than in flood survey, whatever the gauging station. As already pointed out by a number of authors (e.g. Kirchner et al., 2004 ), routine monitoring misses almost all flood events and thus fails to reveal the fine structure and the amplitude of concentrations during flood. During a given flood, concentrations of both indicator bacteria could vary over three orders of magnitude. Moreover, looking at each flood separately, it is worth noting that the ranges of mean concentrations of TTC and FS were similar. The earliest autumn floods were more contaminated than subsequent floods, for both TTC and FS (e.g. P#1 vs P#2 or V#9(R2) vs V#10(R2)): bacterial land and in-stream stores, filled during the dry periods, are partly flushed by the very first floods ( Wilkinson et al., 2006 ), but subsequent floods are still contaminated. However, #7 and #8 events, observed in September 2003 at V(R3) station did not follow the same pattern: The first flood was so small (with a peak discharge of less than 70 L/s) that bacterial stores were not flushed out at all. Late autumn floods were the least contaminated for both TTC and FS (e.g. V#6(R3)). Detailed dynamics of bacterial concentrations are presented in Fig. 4a–d for four well-sampled floods. For all the floods, concentrations of FS and TTC showed similar dynamics: concentrations starts one order of magnitude higher that level observed in routine survey and then decreased after the peak discharge. It may be assumed that after the peak, both dilution effects and exhaustion of bacterial stores resulted in a decrease in bacterial concentrations. Looking at the FS/TTC ratios, it is obvious that, for most of the floods, concentrations of FS were higher than those of TTC during the rising flood. It may be assumed that the first part of the flood corresponds to the flushing of old bacterial stores with high organic matter contents in which streptococcus had a longer capacity to survive than coliforms ( Sherer et al., 1992; del Mar Lleo et al., 2005; Haller et al., 2009a ). In fact, during this period, ash-free dry mass (AFDM) represented more than 70% of the total suspended solids (TSS): Suspended solids consisted mainly of organic matter associated with indicator bacteria, as already reported by Baudart et al., (2000) . During the recession, most of the floods showed TTC/FS ratios higher than 1, reflecting the impact of a recent source of contamination: probably the overflow of combined sewer systems. Correlation analysis confirmed the above assumptions. As the result of their related dynamics, the correlations between TTC and FS concentrations (log10 transformed variables) were strong except for floods occurring during the #9 and #10 rain event. Bacterial concentrations and suspended solids were also closely correlated (minimum Pearson-CC 0.7, p < 0.05): indicator bacteria were mainly bound to particulate matter removed from the riverbed sediments and from soil particles. The correlations between bacterial concentrations and flow discharges were weaker; moreover, Pearson-CC showed positive or negative values depending on the flood dynamics. For example, the complex V#8 (R2) flood event consisted in a fast rainfall–runoff event that was followed by a karstic flood ( Fig. 4 c): Pearson-CC between bacterial concentrations and flow discharges were negative for both TTC ( r = −0.46) and FS ( r = −0.42) at p < 0.05, underlying the major dilution effect of the karstic flood on bacterial concentrations. Another example is the P#2 event, ( Fig. 4 b): Pearson-CC between bacterial concentrations and flow discharges were positive for both TTC ( r = 0.82) and FS ( r = 0.85), confirming the hypothesis of a strong flush effect and the exhaustion of bacterial stores. 4.2 Bacterial flood loads TFL were evaluated for the complete set of floods. The results (in log 10 transformed values) are shown in Table 2 , together with the hydrological characteristics of the observed flood events. Considering all flood events together, TTC-TFLs varied from 10.98 to 14.90 log 10 cfu; FS-TFLs varied from 10.83 to 14.74 log 10 cfu. In most cases, for a given flood, TTC- and FS-TFLs had similar orders of magnitude. But during early spring floods (e.g. P#4 or V#4(R3)) TTC-TFL reached higher values than FS-TFL: Old bacterial stores are not involved in such flood probably because accumulation processes on the hillslopes or in the riverbed are limited during the antecedent wet period (i.e. winter). The lowest TFL values were observed in the smallest catchment (i.e. V(R1)) or during small rainfall–runoff events (e.g. P#3 or V#7); the highest values were observed in early autumn floods. TFL increased along the Vène river (e.g. #6, #8 and #10 rain events). Correlation analysis is used here (i) to point out which of the hydrological characteristic(s) (see Table 2 ) is (are) statistically best linked to TFLs and (ii) to check which land use descriptor best explain TFL. The land-use descriptors concern agricultural, natural and urban areas (expressed as a percentage of the catchment area), population density and the population that uses septic tanks and is not connected to the sewage system. Correlations between TFLs (log 10 transformed values) and explanatory variables are presented in Table 3 . We found highly significant relationships between TFLs and the hydrological descriptors of the event, in particular PQ, V and H , which were linked to the magnitude of the flood. PI showed weaker correlations with TFLs. PI is more related to land phase processes. The magnitude of the dry period before the flood, described by H-30, shows no significant correlation with TFL. That would suggest low contribution from the hillslope to the bacteria TFL. Since Salles et al. (2003) underlined the importance of H-30 for total suspended solid total flood load in the same catchments. There were no significant correlations between TTC-TFL (or FS-TFL) and antecedent hydrological condition. Correlations between TFL and land-use descriptors were not very strong. Urban area and population density were both linked to TFL both for TTC and for FS. The lack of significant correlations with agricultural or natural areas reflects the dominance of urban sources of the faecal indicator during floods. The effects of agricultural activities, dominated by vineyards, were weak. Even when natural areas were used for sheep and poultry, they did not produce significant amounts of bacterial pollution. The strong impact of human sources on bacterial loads during floods was quite surprising for several reasons: these catchments are sparsely populated; a dense sewage network deserves the scattered inhabitants, so only a small percentage of the population use septic tanks. Tests showed that when we randomly removed one flood from the data set, the correlation matrix remained unchanged. The non-significant correlations concerned the same pair of variables. H , V and PQ variables always showed the strongest correlations, with r values greater than 0.7 (significance at p < 0.01). The ranking of the three correlation coefficients depended upon which flood was removed, but most of the best correlations involved PQ. Thus, in the coastal Mediterranean catchments studied here, bacterial flood loads were mainly explained first by the magnitude of the flood that flushed out riverbed sediments, then by the impact of human sources and lastly by the intensity of the rainfall that contributed to flushed out bacterial land store. 5 Bacterial flood modeling 5.1 Statistical modeling of total flood loads The dataset was split into two sub-sets to investigate linear relationships between hydrological variables, land use-descriptors and TFL. Five floods were kept for validation purposes: one was randomly chosen in each catchment; the 15 others were used to fit the models ( Table 2 ). From the above correlation analysis, only three hydrological variables were kept as explanatory factors: PQ (flood magnitude), PI (land process magnitude), H 30 (antecedent conditions); four out of five land-use descriptors were kept: percentage of agricultural area (agricultural impacts), percentage of natural area (breeding impacts), the population using septic tanks and population density (human impact magnitude). The other variables were removed, because correlations existed among them at p < 0.05. H was correlated to all the hydrological variables except H -10; H -10 and H -30 were correlated; the same was true for V and PQ, MI and PI, percentage of urban area and population density. Multiple linear regression models were fitted between TFL (TTC and FS), and the set of explanatory factors using an ascendant stepwise method. As expected, peak discharge appeared to be the best explanatory factor for 1-factor linear regression models for both TTC-TFL and FS-TFL. The plots of observed versus predicted TFLs are shown in Fig. 5 a and b. The adjusted coefficient of determination was already high for TTC-TFL ( r 2 = 0.679). The five validation points were within the 95% prediction interval. However two of them are located far from the model line for TTC: Predicted TTC-TFL load for V#10(R3) flood were 1.5 orders of magnitude higher than the observed value. For FS, the worst prediction also concerned the V#10(R3) flood, with an excess error in the order of magnitude of 2. The 2-factor models were similar for TTC-TFL and FS-TFL. The second best explanatory factor was population density. For FS, there was a significant increase in the coefficient of determination compared to the 1-factor model: from 0.594 to 0.712. In validation, all the predicted values were within the 95% prediction interval, as already observed for the 1-factor model. Nevertheless, the 2-factor model does not improve the accuracy of the predicted load. Opposite, for some of the validation points, the prediction accuracy from the 2-factor model is less than prediction from the 1-factor model. The coefficient of determination improvement for FS was too slight to justify the use of the 2-factor models. 5.2 Annual estimates of bacterial loads due to flood events The 1-factor model was applied on the discharge measured on a 5 min time step at the outlet of the Vène river (R3 station) from September 1994 to August 2007. For the 12 year period we derived the annual TTC loads considering loads from floods and loads during periods without flood. Flood loads were calculated using the statistical model derived from this study. Loads during no-flood period are estimated from the product of the volume and the median value of the TTC concentration observed during the regular sampling. Fig. 6 a reports the total annual loads with the loads during: no-flood; the major flood and during all floods except the major flood for the 12 years data. Annual rain depth observed over the basin and the average inter-annual rain depth estimated by Grillot (2006) are given Fig. 6 b. Total annual load ranges over three orders of magnitude from 13.92 to 16.61 log 10 cfu. The total load uncertainty derived from our statistical model, is close to one order of magnitude. The annual basin export is in between 1.2 10 12 and 6.1 × 10 14 cfu TTC/km 2 /year, on average it equals 1.3 × 10 14 cfu TTC/km 2 /year. This is close to the export coefficient for Scotland and Northern Ireland of between 10 13 and 10 14 cfu/km 2 /year suggested by Kay et al. (2007) but is two orders of magnitude larger than the export coefficient reported by Mckergow and Davies-Colley (2010) for the rural Motueka basin. Nevertheless, a large inter-annual variability is observed and the floods contribution is of high importance. Low annual loads (i.e. in the range 10 14 cfu) coincide with annual rain depth lower than the average inter-annual rain. But a dry year does not necessarily imply low loads (e.g. year 2004–2005). It depends more on the temporal distribution of the rain during the year than the annual rain depth. For the all years, the contribution of no-flood periods to the annual TTC load represent never more than 2% of the total annual load. For 8 years out of 12, the floods events are bringing at least 99.9% of the annual load. Furthermore, it appears that the single major flood has a great impact on the annual flood load. On average, at the year scale, the load of the single major flood is 10 times more than the all other floods. It contributes at least to half of the annual flood load. Over the 12 year period in average the single major flood contributes to 74% of the total annual load. Such results emphasized the need to carefully assess the inputs during flood. 5.3 Sources of bacterial loads during a flood event Attention was paid to increases in bacterial load along the Vène river to estimate the apportionment of the bacterial load within the various sources of bacteria. The gauging stations are located along the Vène river, from the spring (R1) to the outlet (R3). Hereafter, the results are illustrated with specific reference to TTC which was closely related to FS ( r = 0.95, p < 0.01). Fig. 7 presents the balance sheet of bacterial total flood loads along the Vène river reaches for the #10 rain event. Total flood loads of TTC measured at the gauging stations V(R1) , V(R2) and V(R3) are compared with estimated loads supplied to the river along V(R1)-to-V(R2) and V(R2)-to-V(R3) river reaches. Along the river reach, bacterial loads were assumed to originate from: (i) runoff over hillslope bacterial land stores; (ii) overflow of sewage systems and (iii) in-stream bacterial stores accumulated during the dry season and flushed during floods. Loads from land stores were roughly calculated by multiplying an estimated runoff volume supplied to the river between the two gauging stations by an estimated land runoff bacterial concentration. The land runoff bacterial concentration was estimated from the highest event mean concentration observed at the V(R1) station. Actually, at the V(R1) station the almost source of bacterial is the washing of land stores by runoff. Loads from overflowing sewage systems were calculated by multiplying an estimated duration of overflow (taken as equal to the duration of rainfall events lasting more than 5 min with intensities exceeding 10 mm/h) by an estimated bacterial fluxes of waste waters ( Ellis and Yu, 1995 ). Loads from in-stream stores were calculated by multiplying the number of dry days before the flood by the daily amount of contamination continuously supplied to the river by the STW during the dry season. The #9 rain event occurs ten days before the #10 rain event. It is indeed possible to place the period before the #10 rain event in the same category as a long dry period. Actually low levels of TFL where observed during the #9 rain event and we assume that in-stream-stores are poorly affected by the #9 rain event. It is worth noting that the total load observed at the V(R1) gauge station represented only 2% of the total load observed at the V(R2). TFL was 2 orders of magnitude lower at V(R1) station than at V(R3) station. The proportions were even lower in terms of volume. Looking at the estimates of V(R1)-to-V(R2) loads, bacterial loads from land stores were 20% of loads from the other sources. Overflows of sewage systems and in-stream stores are likely to have made similar TTC contributions. Adding V(R1) TFL to V(R1)-to-V(R2) estimated loads represents no more than 20% of observed V(R2) TFL. The V(R2)/V(R3) ratios were much higher than V(R1)/V(R2) ratios in terms of volumes and loads: V(R2) represents one half of the bacterial loads at the outlet during the flood. Between V(R2) and V(R3), land and in-stream stores are likely to have contributed similar volumes of TTC and FS. But their loads were more than two orders of magnitude lower than V(R3) TFL. Maximum loads from sewage overflows plus V(R2) TFL were of the same order of magnitude as V(R3) TFL. But no more than 60% of V(R3) TFLs were explained by adding V(R2), V(T) TFLs and mean V(R2)-to-V(R3) loads. So, estimated loads originating from the potential sources did not entirely explain the spatial increase in TFL along the river during the flood event. Some of the sources were probably underestimated, or other processes should have been taken into consideration. In-stream stores of bacteria in particular require further investigation. Some studies have reported high concentrations of bacteria in riverbed sediments ( Baudart et al., 2000; Jamieson et al., 2004 ), but the rates of accumulation of bacteria in riverbed sediments are not yet well known. Moreover, due to the presence of organic matter, bacteria trapped in sediments are probably able to survive and even to multiply ( Sherer et al., 1992 ). At the end of the dry period, the total stock of indicator bacteria in in-stream stores could be much higher that the bacterial loads released into the river by the continuous direct point-sources. Got et al. (2006) observed increasing bacterial concentrations in the riverbed sediments of the Vène river during one dry month: from 3.3 to 4.8 log 10 cfu per 100 cm 3 of dry sediment for TTC and 4.3 to 5.3 log 10 cfu per 100 cm 3 of dry sediment for FS; but these figures are difficult to extrapolate all along the river. Other possible sources of contamination also need further investigation. 6 Conclusion The aim of this study was to characterize bacterial loads during Mediterranean flood events in terms of temporal dynamics and spatial evolution and to relate total bacterial flood loads to flood characteristics and land-use descriptors. A final discussion gives a first estimation of the apportionment of the bacterial load within the various sources along the river. During the rising flood period, concentrations of indicator bacteria increased rapidly. Bacterial concentrations peaked before peak discharge. This fast response is attributed to bacteria trapped in the sediments, in-stream stores bacteria that were flushed by the high flow velocities. During the recession period, the decrease in concentrations was slow and sometimes erratic. During this period, TTC/FS ratios were generally higher than 1, pointing to the contribution of more recent sources than in stream stores bacteria, probably the overflow of the combined sewage systems. Correlation analysis showed that, (i) Among the land-use descriptors, the percentage of urban areas and population density was most strongly correlated with total flood loads. So, in the Vène and Pallas rivers, agricultural and rearing activities have a lower impact on bacterial contamination of the rivers than human sources of indicator bacteria. (ii) Among the hydrological variables, total flood loads were explained by the magnitude of the flood, that is to say by peak discharge, flood volume and rainfall amount, but weakly correlated with peak rainfall intensities. This confirmed that land processes (controlled by rainfall intensities) had a limited impact on the bacterial loads in the rivers, but that rivers processes (controlled by peak discharge and flood volume) are of primary importance. Simple linear regression models were used to estimate total flood loads of TTC and FS. The 1-factor model, relating loads to peak discharge, showed better agreement than the 2-factor model, which added the influence of population density. Our attempt to extrapolate to total annual loads highlighted the importance of floods and the single major flood to the bacterial loads. The advantage of the statistical model for estimating the flood loads brought to the lagoon by the two rivers on an annual scale is its simplicity and its robustness. Bacterial loads are increasing along the river. A raw approach shows that land sources made rather small contributions and only 40–70% of bacterial loads at the gauging stations could be explained by the estimated contribution of bacterial in-stream stores and overflows of sewage systems. For a better understanding of bacterial accumulation in the riverbed between floods, a more deterministic approach is necessary in order to integrate the bacterial processes that occur during the low flow periods.

621928855aee126c0f98a31c,"The Selandian (Paleocene) mollusc fauna from Copenhagen, Denmark: the Poul Harder 1920 collection",,[{'name': 'Kaj Ingemann Schnetler'}],"A detailed study has been made of the molluscan fauna in the material collected by Poul Harder in 1920 from the classical Danish early Selandian (Late Paleocene) locality in the Lellinge Greensand at Sundkrogen (the harbour of Copenhagen). A description is also given of the now submerged locality. The Harder collection, which has remained virtually unstudied for more than 75 years, is discussed in the interesting historical context that it was not included in the monograph on the Paleocene of Copenhagen by J.P.J. Ravn in 1939. Ravn's study was based on material collected the same year from Sundkrogen by A. Rosenkrantz, and on material collected in the thirties from other localities in the Copenhagen area. Some material collected by A. Rosenkrantz and others, but not dealt with by J.P.J. Ravn, is also included in the present study. The long-lasting controversy about publication rights relating to the Sundkrogen material is recalled. Twenty-seven new species are introduced, viz. Portlandia (Yoldiella) nielseni n. sp., Plicatula selandica n. sp., Laternula (Laternulina) ravni n. sp., Dentalium (Dentalium) sundkrogensis n. sp., Solariella (Solariella) ravni n. sp., Solariella (Solariella) hauniensis n. sp., Teinostoma (Teinostoma) ledoni n. sp., Entomope kirstineae n. sp., Harrisianella subglabra n. sp., Bittium (Bittium) oedumi n. sp., Cerithiopsidella (Vatopsis) rasmusseni n. sp., Seila (Notoseila) heilmannclauseni n. sp., Seila (Notoseila) anderseni n. sp., Thereitis weinbrechti n. sp., Cirsotrema (Cirsotrema) hauniensis n. sp., Opalia (Pliciscala) thomseni n. sp., Charonia (Sassia) danica n. sp., Siphonalia arlejansseni n. sp., Astyris (Astyris) lappanni n. sp., Streptolathyrus danicus n. sp., Streptolathyrus lemchei n. sp., Cancellaria (sensu lato) jakobseni n. sp., Pseudocochlespira rosenkrantzi gen. et sp. n., Actaeopyramis marcusseni n. sp., Chrysallida (Parthenina) peterseni n. sp., Syrnola (Syrnola) granti n. sp. and Cingulina harderi n. sp. Within the Turridae, Pseudocochlespira n. gen. is established. A total of 182 taxons are listed. Of these, 36 are new for the Lellinge Greensand, and 60 have not previously been recorded from Sundkrogen. The study demonstrates that several genera have their first occurrence datum in the Selandian. The Selandian mollusc fauna from Sundkrogen and elsewhere in the Copenhagen area has no equivalent in the North Sea Basin, but faunas from boulders of Selandian age from the south-eastern part of Denmark and the southern part of Sweden demonstrate affinities with the Sundkrogen fauna, whereas the fauna from the Kerteminde Marl demonstrates a lesser degree of affinity. The palaeoenvironment is interpreted as a transgression of the Selandian Sea with erosion of the underlying Danian sediments. The near-shore environment was followed by gradually increasing water depth, resulting in deposits of fine-grained sand and finally dark clay. The dark clay was probably deposited in a deep inlet from the eastern margin of the Selandian Sea.",,
5fc772cb5016bf8811eed138,The catchment of the Brassus karst spring (Swiss Jura): a synthesis of the tracer tests,,"[{'name': 'J Perrin'}, {'name': 'PY Jeannin'}, {'name': 'Y Lavanchy'}]","Two successive tracer tests were carried out in the Pleine Lune cave which is located in the central part of the Brassus karstic spring catchment area (South-western Jura, Switzerland). During both experiments, the tracers were not recovered neither. at the Brassus spring nor at the secondary springs. Following this amazing result, the available data on this spring have been studied and a synthesis is proposed in this paper. The Brassus karstic spring, situated in the south-western part of Vallee de Joux, is an important resurgence from this part of the folded Jura. The water emerges from Cretaceous limestones covered by a thin layer of moraine: the main alimentation comes however from the underlying Maim limestone aquifer, Cretaceous limestones bring only a limited part of the total discharge. Within the supposed Brassus spring catchment areal 18 tracer tests were realised, but only half of them gave positive results. Positive tracer rests show low velocities and poor restitution percentage, particularly during low water periods. Such peculiarities are attributed to an important saturated zone, favouring dilution and dispersion of the tracers. The average discharge at the: spring is assumed to be less than 500 l/s and the average specific discharge is about 40 l/s/km(2), following previous data on other springs of the area. A calculated catchment area with such values would have a surface of 13,5 km(2); but the catchment area derived from the topography of the base of the Maim aquifer (top of the argovian marls considered as an aquitard) covers 56 km(2). This important difference as well as the negative results obtained from the Pleine Lune cave tracer tests show how difficult it is to define a catchment area for limestone aquifers: on one hand a delimitation based on water balance calculations tends to underestimate the catchment area by neglecting outlets as direct infiltration in the alluviums and secondary springs. On the other hand a delimitation based on geological considerations seems to overestimate the surface; this is illustrated by negative tracer tests results with injection points situated well inside the catchment area.",,

This subsurface stratigraphic succession consists of bioclastic grainstones to mudstones containing bryozoa, benthonic and planktonic foraminifera, echinoderms, brachiopods, and molluscs. The basal bryozoa-dominated Clifton Formation was deposited in relatively shallow waters. The overlying Gellibrand Marl, rich in planktonic foraminifera and bryozoa, formed under deep waters. The uppermost unit, benthonic foraminifera-dominated Port Campbell Limestone, was deposited in a moderately deep, middle shelf environment. Cementation is limited and includes: (1) scalenohedral calcite (non-luminescent to bright, Mn- and Fe-poor, in inter- and intraparticle porosity); (2) blocky equant calcite (dull, Mn- and Fe-rich, in interparticle porosity); (3) syntaxial calcite overgrowths on echinoderm particles (non/bright/dull-zoned); (4) euhedral dolomite (in the interparticle pore space of the Port Campbell Limestone); (5) bladed-prismatic calcite (ferroan, in planktonic foraminifera); (6) fibrous calcite (non-luminescent, in intraparticle porosity); and (7) glauconite and iron-oxides (only in intraparticle porosity). All CaCO3 cements are low-Mg calcites(< 4 mol% MgCO3). The cements observed in the Heytesbury Group appear to have formed in three successive diagenetic environments: (1) early shallow burial (early Fe- and Mn-poor, non-luminescent syntaxial overgrowths and non-luminescent scalenohedral calcite, under oxidising conditions); (2) late shallow burial (bright, more Mn-rich syntaxial overgrowth zone, i.e., more than the initial non-luminescent one, and bright scalenohedral calcite, under moderately reducing pore water conditions); and (3) moderate burial (ferroan, dull blocky calcite and dull syntaxial overgrowth zone, under reducing conditions). Pressure solution was the main cement-producing mechanism, although seawater and aragonite dissolution could account for the precipitation of the early non-luminescent cements. Scarcity of early interparticle cements may have been caused by the calcite-rich character of the original sediments. The ferroan duly luminescent blocky equant calcite and syntaxial overgrowths, typically interpreted to represent products of deep burial in ancient carbonate successions, are observed in the shallow-buried Port Campbell Limestone.",,

A study has been conducted to describe the different types of ephemeral gullies and to determine their origin, evolution and importance as sediment sources. Three main types were identified according to their origin: classic ephemeral gullies formed within the same field where runoff starts, drainage ephemeral gullies collecting the runoff from another upstream area, and discontinuity ephemeral gullies due to some abrupt slope change in the landscape. During 2 consecutive years of normal precipitation, ephemeral gully erosion has caused significant soil losses, locally over 2.66 kg m−2 yr−1, which is above tolerable levels. In each year, one short and intense rainfall event has been responsible for almost all soil losses from ephemeral gullies. The main cause of gully formation is the lack of any proper waterway for conveying water excess. Conventional tillage practices provoked gully occurrence, while the maintenance of stubble or vegetation cover completely prevented their formation. Although farmers refill gullies every year, they reappear at the same position if no preventive measures are taken. Early winter has been the most critical period for gully formation, when the soil is wetter and the surface cover is scarce. But a strong summer thunderstorm also caused severe gully erosion in unprotected soils. Two simple topographic indices based on the area and the slope of the watersheds are useful to describe total soil losses.",,

 chert, shale and marl horizons. The recognised rock units are correlated with their counterparts commonly used in the Gulf
 of Suez region and central Sinai including from base to top: the Raha Formation, Abu Qada Formation, Wata Formation, Matulla
 Formation and the Sudr Chalk.
 
 Twelve limestone microfacies are encountered and are categorised as mudstones (pelmicrite and ostracod micrite), wackestones
 (pelagic biomicrite and foraminiferal biomicrite), grainstones (foraminiferal biopelsparite and oosparite), boundstones (bindstone
 and framestone), floatstones (coated-grained biomicrudite, rudist biomicrudite and shelly biomicrudite) and rudstones (shelly
 biosparudite). The dolostone microfacies include fine-medium crystalline ostracod dolostones and shelly dolostones. These
 microfacies have been compared with the Standard Microfacies Types and their depositional environments are discussed.
 
 
 
 The encountered litho- and biofacies suggest that the Cenomanian shallow transgressive sea had covered east central Sinai
 as far south as the Dahab region. By the advent of the Turonian, open marine subtidal conditions prevailed. This was followed
 by transitional conditions with shoals and tidal bars in the Late Turonian pointing to a regressive phase more pronounced
 at the southern localities. The rocks of the Matulla Formation were deposited in an oscillating environment of shallow subtidal
 to intertidal conditions during Coniacian-Santonian. In the Late Santonian and during most of the Campanian-Maastrichtian,
 sedimentation was influenced by open marine conditions with low sedimentation rates; local shallow subtidal regressive events
 occurred.

Less known are other leptin effects such as the stimulation of hematopoesis and some parts of immunity system. The role of leptin in the pathogenesis of some malignant tumors is discussed. Only a little is known about bone marl ow adipocyte leptin production. We examined leptin concentrations in the sera from peripheral blood and bone marrow, the percentage of bone marrow fat, the degree of bone marrow infiltration, the body mass index (BMT) in 42 patients with lymphoproliferative diseases. We found that bone marrow has significantly lower leptin levels (6,6 +/- 10,9 ng/ml) than peripheral blood (9,1 +/- 11,5 ng/ml) (p < 0.0001). Bone marrow and peripheral blood leptin levels have also a significant thin correlation (r = +0.91, p < 0.0001). Bone marrow (r = +0.55, p < 0.0005) and peripheral blood (r = +0.52, p < 0.0005) leptin concentrations are significantly correlated to BMI. Blood serum leptin (r = +0.46, p < 0.003) and bone marrow leptin (r = +0.40, p < 0.01) are related to the bone marrow fat percentage. In addition we found a negative correlation of blood serum leptin (r = -0.59, p < 0.0001) and bone marrow leptin (r = -0.42, p < 0.005) to bone marrow malignant infiltration. When we divided the patients into groups with bone marrow infiltration more than 10% and without or less than 10% infiltration, the first group had significantly lower peripheral blood (p < 0.001) and bone mal row (p < 0.02) leptin. We also confirmed a relation of bone marrow fat and infiltration (r = +0.49, p < 0.001). Our results suggest a relationship among leptin levels in blood or bone mal row and bone marrow infiltration in lymphoproliferative diseases.

In addition to the three turbidite groups (organic, volcanic, and calcareous) described in previous publications, gray nonvolcanic, brown and volcaniclastic turbidite groups were also recognized. Site 950 shows the longest sequence begin- ning with emplacement of two coarse volcaniclastic turbidites in the late Eocene. This was followed by a long interval of pelagic clay deposition until at least the end of the Oligocene. During this time volcanic ash was added from the now-extinct Cruiser/Hyeres/Great Meteor volcanic seamounts to the west. A hiatus in the lower Miocene rock is associated with the deposi- tion of three coarse calcarenites at Site 950, also believed to be from the seamounts. The uppermost calcarenite is a clear marker bed at 16 Ma. Sites 951 and 952 comprise thick sequences of relatively thin organic turbidites through the lower Miocene sequence, representing early infill of the fracture zone valleys in which they wer e drilled. Many sequences of flows can be correlated between all three sites from the middle Miocene to Holocene, although a series of brown turbidites occurring during the late Miocene (6.5 -13 Ma) at Site 950 is less easy to trace. Volcanic turbidites are rare or very thin prior to 7 Ma, but common and thick after this time. Gray nonvolcanic turbidites are found in four limited intervals between 10.5-14.6 Ma, 5.6-7.4 Ma, 3.8-4.2 Ma, and 1.4-1.2 Ma, and include the thickest turbidites of all (11 m at Site 952). The pelagic interbeds reveal the history of the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) which was shallower than the abyssal plain depth until ~8 Ma. Then the CCD deepened slightly, deepening again at ~5 Ma and finally entered the Pliocene/Pleis- tocene oscillatory mode at ~3.5 Ma.

Correlations between basinal evaporite-bearing series and marginal carbonate platforms allow for improvement of the classical depositional models, especially concerning the eustatic control of the environmental changes in the Mediterranean. These changes were controlled by the interplay of aperiodic and periodic factors: (1) tectonics, related to the relative motions of the African and Furasian plates and resultant linear increase in basin restriction; (2) sea-level fluctuations that alternately aggravated the restriction or allowed marine replenishment, and (3) climatic fluctuations that controlled the level of the Mediterranean during stages of isolation. The Messinian sedimentary succession reflects a typical sequence of progressive isolation: marine marls --> laminites --> transitional deposits --> evaporites --> lacustrine deposits. The structure of the carbonate platforms shows that during early Messinian time, the sea-level regime changed from a highstand (TB3.2 cycle) that was responsible for widespread extension of the carbonate platforms to the classical ""Messinian regression"" that induced final isolation of the Mediterranean water body and onset of the so-called ""salinity crises."" The first stage of the crisis was characterized by a Mediterranean lowstand that resulted in erosion of former platforms and deposition of the lower evaporites. During the next stage, sea level rose (TB3.3 cycle) high enough to temporarily replenish the basin (cyclic upper evaporites, with development of stromatolite-rich deposits). Finally, the uppermost Messinian freshwater to brackish lacustrine deposits reflect both the cessation of sea-water input (maximum tectonic isolation, low sea level) and freshwater input related to increasing runoff.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/71/E7/A6/71E7A658E3AA4F7ECD1FB256B87205A8.pdf

Previous studies restricted to the equatorial plane have shown that MLBs are rare spherical objects that are 1–4 μm in diameter and covered by multiple layers of thin lipid-rich membranes. Methods Eight human aged transparent lenses were obtained from eye bank donors and eight human age-related nuclear cataracts were obtained immediately after extracapsular extraction. Each sample was Vibratome sectioned fresh into 200 μm thick sections that were fixed and embedded for light or electron microscopy. Light micrograph montages of the optic axis containing the juvenile, fetal and embryonic nuclei were examined. Mie scattering for random coated spherical particles was calculated based on assumed and measured particle parameters. Results Cells along the optic axis of the cataract contained approximately 7·5 times more MLBs as similar regions of the aged transparent lens, although these MLBs occurred with extremely low frequency. Cells of the aged transparent lens contained 1·3 MLBs mm −2 , while those of the cataract contained 9·6 MLBs mm −2 , which are equivalent to calculated densities of 5·6×10 2 and 4·1×10 3 mm −3 , respectively. While some MLBs were located within the cytoplasm near cell membranes, others were found away from membranes. The MLBs are distinct from circular profiles resulting from finger-like projections between adjacent cells. MLBs displayed varying geometries and cytoplasmic textures, although predominately spherical with interiors similar to adjacent fiber cell cytoplasm. These results are in agreement with previous theoretical analysis of light scattering from human lenses and with previous morphological studies examining the equatorial plane of the lens. Potential Mie scattering of spherical particles with the average properties of the observed MLBs and assumed refractive index properties was calculated to be forward scattering of as much as 20% of the incident light. Conclusions The observed low frequency and absence of clustering of MLBs in the equatorial plane and along the optic axis suggests that MLBs are most likely uniformly distributed throughout the embryonic, fetal and juvenile nuclei of age-related cataracts. Because of their size, distribution, textured cytoplasm and calculated Mie scattering, MLBs probably cause local fluctuations in refractive index in human lens nuclei and, therefore, are potential sources of low-angle, forward light scattering that could impair image formation. Keywords human nuclear cataract light scattering electron microscopy histology multilamellar bodies transparent human lens age-related cataract 1 Introduction How the lens begins to lose its transparency and scatter light is not clearly understood. Many studies have concentrated on potential damage to the crystallins, the proteins that pack the cytoplasm of the differentiated organelle-free lens fiber cells. These proteins, which permanently remain in lens fiber cells once produced, can undergo irreversible damage if they are oxidized, glycosylated, carbamylated, deamidated, or cross-linked ( Zigler, 1994; Hanson et al., 2000 ). If the proteins are cross-linked, they may form high molecular weight aggregates ( Jedziniak et al., 1973, 1975, 1978 ). These protein modifications may lead to local changes in the index of refraction, which may in turn cause light to scatter ( Benedek, 1971, 1997 ; Benedek et al., 1999 ). As fiber cells and their crystallins age without being replaced, their molecular pathology progresses, resulting in the development of the opacity of the cataractous lens. The patient often experiences an increase in glare and a loss of visual acuity. Scattering particles composed of damaged protein, however, have been difficult to visualize because of their small size and irregular shape. Electron microscopic studies have demonstrated that cytoplasm of both aged transparent lenses and nuclear cataractous lenses is smooth ( Al-Ghoul and Costello, 1996; Taylor and Costello, 1999 ). This smoothness indicates that the proteins present, while potentially damaged and even fused into high molecular weight aggregates, are homogenous in distribution and not likely to be major light scattering particles ( Taylor and Costello, 1999 ). Indeed some cataracts have been shown to contain rough, textured cytoplasm as seen by electron microscopy, but most cataracts appear smooth, even though they may scatter light by slit lamp examination ( Al-Ghoul and Costello, 1996; Al-Ghoul et al., 1996; Taylor and Costello, 1999; Freel et al., 2002 ). Since cataract is a multifactorial disease, it is likely that there are other light scattering sources, such as larger particles, that might produce more significant amounts of scattered light. Just as fiber cell cytoplasmic proteins are not replenished throughout life, fiber cell membranes synthesized early in life are not metabolized and can be subject to chronic oxidative damage ( Spector, 1984; Spector, 1995; Truscott, 2000 ). Oxidation of these membranes may cause irreversible cellular pathology ( Babizhayev et al., 1988 ). It is possible that membrane damage might result in scattering particles that are larger than the molecular scattering particles caused by protein damage. These larger particles may be more effective at producing large fluctuations in refractive index and scattering light than smaller particles. The multilamellar bodies (MLBs) recently described are likely candidates for large scattering particles ( Gilliland et al., 2001 ). They are rare spherical objects, occupy a volume fraction of only 3×10 −5 of the cataract, range in size from 1 to 4 μm diameter with an average diameter of about 2·4 μm, and are found within the equatorial plane of the inner nuclei of the human lens. The name is derived from the multiple thin bilayer membranes that coat the surface. While these MLBs were reported at a low frequency and were difficult to visualize, they occurred in histological sections with about 7·5 times greater frequency in cataracts compared to aged transparent lenses ( Gilliland et al., 2001 ). Because they are the only major structural features that have been observed within the nuclear core that are consistently different in cataractous and transparent human nuclei, the MLBs are considered to be potential sources for excess light scattering in age-related nuclear cataracts. Particles of this size and volume fraction were hypothesized to be present by van den Berg (1997) who also suggested that their major contribution would be low-angle scattering. Their lipid-rich outer layer and variably textured interior cytoplasm might be responsible for key fluctuations in the local index of refraction essential to produce significant light scattering ( Gilliland et al., 2001; Tang et al., 2003 ). Although several theoretical treatments have been proposed to describe the scattering from particles of various sizes within the lens ( Debye and Bueche, 1949; Benedek, 1971; Bettelheim, 1985 ), for widely separated large spherical particles the scattering theory developed by Mie about 100 years ago is appropriate ( Mie, 1908 ). Mie provided an analytical solution of Maxwell's equations for scattering from coated spheres ( Born and Wolf, 1959; Kerker, 1969 ). Results of Mie scattering calculations support the hypothesis of van den Berg ( van den Berg, 1997; van den Berg and Spekreijse, 1999 ) that particles of similar size to the MLBs contribute to the low angle scattering. The primary interest of the present study was to further characterize the MLBs within the core of nuclear cataracts and calculate the potential scattering. In the previous study MLBs in the embryonic and fetal nuclear regions were described as viewed in the equatorial plane of the lens. The distribution of MLBs was determined from histological sections as the number per unit area, and the Floderus equation was used to calculate the expected number of MLBs that might be present in a unit volume ( Gilliland et al., 2001 ). In the current study, similar procedures were employed on a larger sample size than in the previous study, and, importantly, MLBs were quantified in the embryonic, fetal and juvenile nuclear regions in a plane containing the optic axis. MLBs along the optic axis are similar in geometry, size and distribution to those in the equatorial plane providing support for the hypothesis that these large particles are randomly distributed within the entire inner nuclear core of age-related nuclear cataracts. A portion of this work has been presented previously ( Gilliland et al., 2002 ). 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Lenses Eight non-diabetic, non-cataractous, aged, transparent donor human eyes (ages 34, 45, 50, 55, 59, 65, 66, 71; Fig. 1 A) were obtained from the North Carolina Eye and Human Tissue Bank (Durham, NC) and transported within 12 h of death to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where the transparent lenses were dissected from the eyes and prepared for analysis. Eight cataractous human nuclei (ages 56, 58, 72, 75, 81, 85, 85, 85) were obtained from the Duke University Eye Center (Durham, NC) after extracapsular cataract extraction. These cataracts were transported to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill the day of surgery and were prepared for analysis in the same fashion as the aged transparent lenses. The cataractous nuclei were not advanced, clinically graded by the surgeon from 1 to 3 (on a 0–4 scale for nuclear sclerosis), and the patients were not diabetic. Photographs of the type of nuclear cataract examined have been published previously ( Al-Ghoul and Costello, 1996; Al-Ghoul et al., 1996 ). All specimens were collected following the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The anterior-to-posterior thickness and equatorial diameter of each lens nucleus were measured so that the center of the lens could be determined ( Fig. 1 A). Lenses were then mounted with cyanoacrylate glue onto a metal sectioning tray, covered with warm 2·5% agar, submerged in Tyrode's salt solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 10°C and sectioned using a vibrating knife microtome (TPI Vibratome model 1000, St. Louis, MO) at an amplitude of 7, a speed of approximately 0·2 mm/s and a cutting angle of 12° ( Fig. 1 B). Because of the precise sectioning process, the center section of each lens was collected for analysis. 2.2 Bright field and confocal fluorescent light microscopy Vibratome sections approximately 200 μm thick were fixed for 12–18 h in 0·5% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde and 1% tannic acid in 0·1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7·2). Sections were then washed with deionized distilled water for three 15-min washings, stained in 2% aqueous uranyl acetate in the dark for 60 min, washed with deionized distilled water once for 10 min and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series. Sections were infiltrated and embedded in LR White resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA), from which histological sections (0·7 μm thick) of the nuclei were cut along the optic axis ( Fig. 1 C) and mounted on glass slides. Mounted sections were stained with toluidine blue oxide (TBO), cover slipped and examined with a Leica DMR brightfield microscope (Solms, Germany). Digital images were collected with a Leica DC500 camera (Solms, Germany) ( Fig. 1 D). Sections of 5–7 μm were cut from fixed and LR White embedded Vibratome sections on a microtome using a glass knife and placed onto glass slides. The sections were heated and stained with the lipophilic dye, DiI (1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3’,3’-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) following the procedures published previously ( Boyle and Takemoto, 1997 ). Optical sectioning on a Zeiss LSM-410 (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) laser scanning confocal microscope was used to examine the tissues. 2.3 Transmission electron microscopy Vibratome sections approximately 200 μm thick were fixed for 12–18 h in 2·5% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde and 1% tannic acid in 0·1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7·2). Sections were then washed with 0·1 M cacodylate for three 15-min washings, treated with cold 0·5% osmium tetroxide for 60 min, washed with deionized distilled water for three 15-min washings, washed once with 50% ethanol for 5 min, stained in 2% uranyl acetate (ethanol-based) in the dark for 30 min and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series. Sections were infiltrated and embedded in an epoxy resin. Thin sections (70 nm) were cut with a diamond knife (Diatome US, Fort Washington, PA) from mesas raised to include the embryonic nucleus along the optic axis ( Fig. 1 C). Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for viewing at 80 kV on a FEI-Philips Tecnai 12 (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) transmission electron microscope. 2.4 Quantitative analysis For each lens, six histological sections were examined. Within each of these 0·7 μm thick sections, a rectangular region (approximately 160 μm in width and 1580 μm in length) containing the embryonic, fetal and juvenile nuclear regions was thoroughly searched. Thus a total area of approximately 1·5 mm 2 was examined for each lens. MLBs were counted, ensuring that the same MLB was not counted twice in serial sections. The data were analysed statistically using StatView version 5·0 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC), employing the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test, appropriate for data with small n , which shows trends that were considered significant for p <0·05. The Floderus equation was used to determine the numerical density ( N V ) of the MLBs ( Bozzola and Russell, 1999; Gilliland et al., 2001 ). The number of MLBs per unit area ( N A , measured data), section thickness ( T =0·7 μm), average diameter of an MLB ( d =2·13 μm, measured average) and height of the cap ( h =1/3 the section thickness, or 0·23 μm) allow the numerical density to be calculated (1) N V = N A / ( T + d − 2 h ) The height of the cap is the smallest observed profile in the section and serves as a correction factor for the small polar regions of a sphere that become lost to the eye, because they are grazed during sectioning and therefore are present only in part of one section ( Bozzola and Russell, 1999 ). 2.5 Calculation of Mie light scattering The amount of light scattered by a single MLB is equal to Q A , where Q is the scattering efficiency of the MLB and A is its cross-sectional area. Because the volume fraction of the MLBs in the lens is quite small (3×10 −5 ), they can be considered as independent scatterers. Therefore the total light scattered by N MLBs equals NQA . In the central square millimeter of the embryonic nucleus, N is equal to ρt , where ρ is the density of MLBs (mm −3 ) and t is the thickness of the nucleus. Since the MLBs are spherical, A is equal to π r 2 , where r is the radius of an MLB. Therefore, the total amount of light scattered by the MLBs in the center of the embryonic nucleus is (2) S = ρ t Q π r 2 Since the central square millimeter has unit area, Eq. (2) also gives the fractional amount of light scattered. The scattering efficiency of spherical MLB particles can be accurately calculated using the Mie scattering theory for coated spheres ( Kerker, 1969 ). This theoretical description of scattering from spheres is based on an exact solution of Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic theory and is a detailed analysis of the diffraction of waves of light by a sphere of any size and composition as long as it is a homogeneous sphere in homogeneous surroundings. The calculations are based on particular assumptions. For instance, the spheres should be separated from each other by distances that are large in comparison to the wavelength of incident light, and they should be of the same diameter and composition. While MLBs appear to be random in distribution and separated by great distances, they show some variation in size and composition. For this analysis, an average MLB diameter and refractive index have been assumed. In the specific case of age-related nuclear cataracts, the scattering efficiency depends on the wavelength of the incident light, the refractive index of the medium, and the refractive index and thickness of both the MLB and the lipid layer which forms the ‘coat’ of the MLB. In this case, the analytical solution was performed with the computer language C in Matlab 6·2 (Mathworks. Inc.), using algorithms developed by Mätzler (2002) . In addition to calculating the scattering efficiencies, the algorithms also calculated the intensity and angular distribution of the scattered light. 3 Results To obtain information about the distribution of MLBs within the volume of the lens nucleus, a study by light microscopy was designed to characterize the distribution of these spherical structures in planes parallel to and containing the optic axis. About 1·5 mm 2 was examined carefully for each of eight aged transparent human lenses and for an equivalent area in each of eight human age-related nuclear cataracts. The results demonstrate that cells along the optic axis contain few MLBs and they appeared to be randomly distributed, indicated by the lack of order or clustering and by the large separation between individual MLBs. These features of the distribution were similar to the MLBs in fiber cells of the equatorial plane ( Gilliland et al., 2001 ). A representative montage of a histological section of the aged transparent human lens along the optic axis reveals the longitudinally sectioned cylindrical primary fiber cells of the embryonic nucleus flanked by the secondary fiber cells of the fetal nucleus which are seen in cross section ( Fig. 2 A and C). A comparable montage of human age-related nuclear cataract, also viewed near the optic axis, displays cells that are similar in morphology to those of the aged transparent lens ( Fig. 2 B and D). No MLBs were found in the montages of the transparent lens ( Fig. 2 A and C). Note that the numerous small particle-like objects in some embryonic nuclear cells are probably due to interdigitations exposed by a tangential section at the cellular interface. For the montage of the cataract, only one MLB was observed ( Fig. 2 D, inset), although it was located an additional 400 μm farther from the edge of the montage. When viewed along the optic axis by transmission electron microscopy, fiber cells from the embryonic nucleus of the cataract ( Fig. 3 ) appear similar to those of the aged transparent lens (data not shown). The longitudinal sections of fiber cells in the embryonic nucleus confirm that the plane of section passes along (or very close to) the optic axis. Also evident in the transmission electron micrographs of the longitudinal sections is the cell size, shape and interdigitation pattern, which is consistent with images obtained with light microscopy ( Fig. 2 ) and scanning electron microscopy ( Al-Ghoul et al., 2001 ). The images also demonstrate that both the cataract and the aged transparent lens contain membrane undulations and numerous circular profiles ( Fig. 3 , arrows) representing the tip ends of finger-like projections of one cell into an adjacent cell. These circular profiles, which are bounded by paired plasma membranes, are distinct from MLBs ( Gilliland et al., 2001 ). An MLB from within the fetal nucleus of a cataractous lens is seen by transmission electron microscopy in Fig. 4 . A high magnification view ( Fig. 4 , inset) demonstrates that the multiple layers of thin, tightly packed lipid membranes are each about 5 nm thick. Three layers are visible here and up to 10 layers have been seen in other MLBs. Most MLBs observed in the embryonic, fetal and juvenile nuclei along the optic axis appear similar to those in the equatorial plane ( Gilliland et al., 2001 ). Whereas some are spherical in shape ( Fig. 5 A, B, D, H and I), others are composed of two or more conjoined spherical units ( Fig. 5 C, E–G and J). Evidence to support the hypothesized spherical geometry of a majority of the unique core structures is provided by the examination of one doublet structure ( Fig. 6 A–C) traced through Z -axis optical sections in about 0·5 μm steps by confocal microscopy ( Fig. 6 D). In the first step, the MLB is barely present, while in the second, third, fourth and fifth steps, it appears to be growing larger, achieving its maximum diameter in the fifth step. In the sixth, seventh and eighth steps, it becomes smaller until finally in the ninth step, it is hardly observable. Therefore, it appears that each component of the doublet is nearly spherical. The analysis of histological sections indicates that MLBs occur with approximately 7·5 times greater frequency along the optic axis in the cataractous nuclei compared to the nuclei of the transparent lenses ( Table 1 ). In each of eight transparent and eight cataractous nuclei, about 1·5 mm 2 of juvenile, fetal and embryonic nuclear regions was searched in the light microscope using high magnification objectives. A majority of aged transparent lenses yielded only 1 or even 0 MLBs per sample in the entire area searched, but one aged transparent lens contained as many as 5 MLBs. Such transparent lenses may contain MLBs that have not been altered with aging sufficiently to developed into major scattering centers. While some cataracts contained fewer than 8 MLBs in the area examined, most cataracts contained more than 8 and one cataract contained 60 MLBs. For a total of over 12 mm 2 of histological sections examined in the 8 cataracts, a total of 117 MLBs were observed, whereas only 16 MLBs were seen in similar regions of aged transparent human lenses ( Table 1 ). Normalizing to the MLBs per unit area examined, the cataracts contained 9·6 MLBs mm −2 , whereas the aged transparent lenses yielded only 1·3 MLBs mm −2 ( Table 1 ). The Mann–Whitney statistical test for small n supports the trend that the cataracts have more MLBs than the aged transparent donors lenses ( p =0·0003) ( Tables 1 and 2 ). To project the number of MLBs per unit volume, the Floderus Eq. (1) was used ( Bozzola and Russell, 1999 ). In 1 mm 3 of tissue, the cataract is predicted to contain 4·1×10 3 MLBs whereas the aged transparent would contain only 5·6×10 2 . The Mie scattering theory for coated spheres was used to calculate the predicted scattering efficiency for MLBs (see Section 2 ). These complex calculations take into account the density of MLBs (4·1×10 3 mm −3 in the cataract versus 5·6×10 2 mm −3 in the transparent lens), the average diameter of an MLB (2·7 μm, which is the average measured diameter of 2·13±0·64 μm, n =117, corrected for the probability of sectioning through the diameter; Bozzola and Russell, 1999 ), the refractive index of the cytoplasm, n =1·40 ( Fagerholm et al., 1981; Pierscionek, 1997; Michael et al., 2003 ), the thickness of the lipid shell (50 nm, which was estimated from this study as 10 layers of 5 nm each), the wavelength of blue and white light (400 and 550 nm, respectively) and the thickness of the lens region in the study (2·6 mm, which is the thickness of the embryonic, fetal and juvenile nuclei; Taylor et al., 1996 ). The most important parameters are the refractive indices of the particle. The critical parameter for the calculations is the ratio of the refractive index of the particle interior to the surrounding; thus, values above and below that of the cytoplasm will have similar contributions to the scattering efficiency. For this model calculation to demonstrate the potential scattering of the MLBs, the estimated refractive index of the lipid shell is n =1·50 ( Matsuzaki et al., 2000 ) and the estimated refractive index of the cytoplasm inside the MLB is n =1·49 ( Michael and Brismar, 2001 ). This latter value was chosen for this example, because it was derived from measurements of a dense mammalian lens nucleus and is somewhat less than 1·54 reported for fish lens nucleus ( Garner et al., 2001 ). The resultant value for scattering efficiency ( Q ) is 2·5 for white light (wavelength 550 nm) and 3·3 for blue light (wavelength 400 nm). The scattered light was calculated from Eq. (2) . For white light, the calculations indicated that in the cataract MLBs may cause about 15% of light to scatter in the forward direction, whereas in the transparent lens, only 2% of the light is expected to be scattered in the forward direction. For blue light, as much as 20% of light is may be scattered in the forward direction by MLBs in the cataract. The results of this latter calculation are presented as a polar plot ( Fig. 7 A) and scattering intensity plot ( Fig. 7 B). The polar plot emphasizes the predicted forward scattering at low angles (mainly less than 10°) from the MLBs and the intensity plot on a log scale emphasizes the rapid drop in intensity as a function of scattering angle. 4 Discussion The distribution of MLBs in histological sections cut parallel to and including the sagittal plane containing the optic axis appeared to be random for both transparent lenses and cataractous nuclei. The particles were not clustered or enriched within any developmental region. The observed density of MLBs was low, representing a volume fraction of only 3×10 −6 for the transparent lens nuclei and 2×10 −5 for the cataractous nuclei (Table 2). When expressed per unit area of histological section examined, the MLBs in the cataracts, at 9·6 MLBs mm −2 , were about 7·5 times more numerous than in the transparent lenses, at 1·3 MLBs mm −2 . The apparently random distribution and low particle density found in this study was indistinguishable from the study of MLBs in transparent and cataractous nuclei in the equatorial plane ( Gilliland et al., 2001 ). The observed similar distribution and density in the two studies of MLBs in perpendicular planes give support to the hypothesis that the rare MLBs are most likely randomly distributed throughout the entire inner nuclear regions in aged human lenses. The consistently higher density of the MLBs in the cataractous nuclei suggests that they should be considered as sources of excess light scattering. Although MLBs are extremely rare in both aged transparent lenses and cataractous nulcei, they are in fact much more numerous in cataracts. Just counting the particles gave a 10 times greater frequency in the cataracts as viewed in the equatorial plane ( Gilliland et al., 2001 ) and when normalized per unit area both the current study and previous data agree, indicating that the MLBs are approximately 7·5 times more numerous in the cataracts. This raises the question of how such distinctive spherical objects could have been overlooked in previous morphological studies. To illustrate the difficulty of documenting the MLBs, two cubes are drawn ( Fig. 8 ) with dimensions of 160 μm on a side and are used to represent the approximate volume of tissue in the embryonic nucleus, 4·0×10 6 μm −3 ( Taylor et al., 1996; Al-Ghoul et al., 2001 ). In one cube are placed 2 MLBs to represent the density in transparent lenses ( Fig. 8 A) and in the other cube, 14 MLBS represent the density in cataracts ( Fig. 8 B). The higher density of MLBs in the cube modeling the cataract is obvious when the whole cube is visualized. However, when sampling the cubes histologically, it is essential to imagine how rarely a particle will be visible in planes only 1 μm thick passing through the cubes. The sampling problem is an order of magnitude more difficult using thin-section TEM. Therefore, these objects have been overlooked mainly because few laboratories have preserved and examined large enough volumes of the inner nucleus to determine particle presence, densities and representative ultrastructural features. The rarity of the MLBs is further emphasized in histological montages ( Fig. 2 ) where no MLBs were observed for either the transparent or cataract samples, even though an area of about 2·5×10 5 μm −2 is visible and over 10 3 cells can be examined. The single MLB in the cataract was not apparent until the montage was greatly extended ( Fig. 2 D, inset). The very low density of MLBs raises another question. Is it possible for objects of such low absolute number to produce light scattering sufficient to affect vision? The answer first involves a summary of the structural details of the MLBs. The perfect circular profiles of many of the particles in microtome sections suggest that they are spherical, a conclusion supported by the confocal optical sections through a complex MLB ( Fig. 6 D). Even when the MLBs contain more than one internal structure, usually one is nearly perfectly spherical (see Fig. 5 E, F and G). Although not all MLBs are spherical (see Fig. 5 A and B), they can effectively be approximated as spheres. A distinctive feature of the MLBs in histological sections is the clear band or coat around the sphere. When a lipophilic dye is used, the band is consistently brighter than the adjacent membranes ( Fig. 6 , Gilliland et al., 2001 ) indicating that the band is rich in lipids. Recent freeze fracture studies support this proposal: a pellet enriched in MLBs when fractured produced smooth fracture faces devoid of intramembrane protein particles (data not shown; Costello et al., 2003 ). The ultrastructure of the band in high-resolution TEM images also supports this interpretation ( Fig. 4 , Gilliland et al., 2001 ). Typically 3 to 10 layers are seen within the band and each layer has the staining pattern of a lipid bilayer and a thickness of about 5 nm. These thin layers are not thick enough to be formed from the plasma membrane specializations of fiber cells, such as gap junctions, thin symmetric junctions or undulating membranes of the lens ( Zampighi et al., 1982; Costello et al., 1989; Zampighi et al., 1989; Costello et al., 1993 ). Gap junctions of the lens are too thick to be the origin of MLB layers, as each of the two gap junction membranes of the lens is 8 nm in thickness. Likewise, MLB membranes are not likely to be derived from ‘thin symmetric junctions,’ which contain two closely-associated membranes each 7 nm thick. Because gap junctions are composed of connexins and thin symmetric junctions are probably composed of MIP/Aquaporin0, these integral membrane channel proteins are not expected to be components of the MLB membranes, which are too thin to accommodate the major membrane proteins of the lens. Even the single curved membranes of the undulating surfaces of fiber cells that contain square arrays of MIP/Aquaporin0 are significantly thicker (7 nm) than the MLB layers (5 nm). Therefore, if MLBs do not form from membranes with integral proteins, then they are instead likely to be generated from lipid rich membranes. Somehow lipid components of the membrane are redistributed into a multilayered shell that isolates the MLB interior from the surrounding cytoplasm. The interiors of the MLBs appear to be similar to the surrounding cytoplasm and are thus probably composed mainly of crystallins ( Fig. 4 , Gilliland et al., 2001 ). Because proteins are generally stained non-specifically, the optical density of stain can approximate the density of the protein. MLBs have been observed to have interiors that are both smoother or more textured than the surrounding cytoplasm as well as more densely stained or lighter than the surrounding cytoplasm ( Gilliland et al., 2001 ). Variations in staining density and structure in TEM and LM reported here and previously ( Gilliland et al., 2001 ) support the conclusion that, for many MLBs, the interior staining pattern, and thus the protein density, is different than the surrounding cytoplasm. These internal variations are related to differences in local refractive index and therefore are expected to contribute to light scattering. To determine the potential contribution of MLBs to light scattering, calculation of the scattering according to Mie (1908) has been presented. This analysis is appropriate for spherical particles that are separated by distances much larger than the wavelength of incident light and that are identical in composition and size. Scattering efficiency per particle is calculated and is dependent on the refractive index ratio of the particle interior to its surroundings and on the ratio of the particle diameter to the wavelength of light. These conditions and parameters can be met approximately. For example, although not all the particles are spherical, most are and the 20% that are more complex can be considered nearly spherical ( Fig. 5 ). The particle sizes also vary over a range of about 1–4 μm but have a fairly narrow distribution around the average diameter of 2·13 μm. The apparent diameter must be corrected by 4/π to account for the probability that the section will pass through the true diameter. The refractive index of the interior, lipid shell and cytoplasm can be approximated from literature values. The results of the calculations, although only an estimate of the true scattering for idealized identical particles, are revealing. They show that scattering at 400 nm incident wavelength is greater than at 550 nm, that a refractive index difference of particle interior ( n =1·49) to surroundings ( n =1·40) of only 0·09 is sufficient to produce important scattering, and that coated spheres with 2–3 micron diameter have high scattering efficiency. Based on the estimated density of MLBs (Eq. (1) ), the intensity of scattering can be calculated (Eq. (2) ). For 400 and 550 nm light, the scattering of incident light was 20% and 15%, respectively, for the cataract, and 3% and 2% for the transparent lenses, respectively. The scattering is strongly in the forward direction ( Fig. 7 ) and is likely to affect high acuity image formation at the macula ( Thomson, 2001 ). These results are consistent with the predictions of van den Berg (1997) who suggested that a small volume fraction of micron sized particles could account for the forward scattering of in vitro human lenses. While it is not known exactly how MLBs form, it is possible that they result from faulty fiber cell elongation that may introduce excess membrane. The excess membrane may be sequestered at the cell interface and over time change composition as proteins migrate from the membrane. This would require a close association with the plasma membrane as is sometimes observed ( Fig. 4 ). Alternatively, MLBs may result during aging from excess cell membranes created after cytoplasmic dehydration and cellular compaction ( Al-Ghoul et al., 2001 ). Closely associated membrane processes may fuse and enclose spherical segments of cytoplasm. Another possibility is that oxidative damage to membranes creates cytoplasmic cell fragments ( Babizhayev et al., 1988 ) which are sequestered by excess membrane that pinches off and coils up to form an MLB. Although the mechanism of these transformations must be quite complex, at least one rat animal model with high oxidative damage has displayed objects similar to MLBs ( Costello et al., 2000; Marsili et al., 2004 ). Moreover, a diabetic rabbit model exhibited some intriguing multilamellar structures near the cortex/nucleus interface that may be templates or precursors for MLB formation as the cells age ( Costello et al., 1993 ). Closely packed multiple thin bilayer membranes, 4–5 nm thick as observed in MLBs, are present in a variety of normal and pathological tissues. For comparison, membranes of non-lens MLB-like structures in type II alveolar cells of canine lung have a thickness between 4·3 and 5·4 nm ( Ochs et al., 2001 ). Non-lens MLB-like structures in rat adipose tissue exhibit a regular periodicity of 4 nm ( Blanchette-Mackie and Scow, 1981; Blanchette-Mackie and Scow, 1983 ). In lenses of humans with Type II diabetes, the cortex/nucleus interface contains many globular bodies some having closely packed 5 nm thick membranes ( Al-Ghoul and Costello, 1993 ). Globular structures sometimes containing multiple membranes have also been observed in the lens cortex. For example, in posterior subcapsular cataracts associated with Type II diabetes, intracellular and extracellular globular bodies have been shown to be the primary cause of opacity ( Creighton et al., 1978 ). Smaller globular bodies (1–4 μm in diameter) in the lens could strongly scatter light, while larger ones (5–20 μm) could scatter and reflect light; together they could account for cortical opacification ( Dilley et al., 1976; Costello et al., 1993; de Gottrau et al., 1993 ). In posterior subcapsular cataracts associated with steroids, Greiner and Chylack have observed multilayed membrane-bound bodies that are 3–4 μm in diameter ( Greiner and Chylack, 1979 ). MLB-like globular bodies have also been observed in the equatorial cortex ( Vrensen et al., 1990 ). While these structures share some structural features with the MLBs described here, the lens nuclear MLBs are unique in their geometry, distribution and location. Lens and non-lens MLB-like structures may serve a multitude of diverse functions. Non-lens MLB-like globules typically serve as lipid storage locations or secretory organelles. Under normal conditions, they provide lipids for lubrication, such as in joints and on mesodermal cell layers of sliding surfaces (e.g. peritoneum, pericardium and pleural mesothelium). Other non-lens MLB-like structures secrete lipids for the purpose of creating hydrophobic water-protective lipid films, as in mucosa cells of the stomach and epithelial cells of the skin ( Hayward, 1979; Schmitz and Muller, 1991 ). MLB-like structures in the lung store surfactant and ultimately secrete it onto the alveolar surface to lower surface tension ( Smith et al., 1972; Coulombe et al., 1988 ). MLB-like globules are also found as a pathological condition in various tissues. They have been noted to be present in atherosclerosis, Niemann-Pick disease, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency, cholestasis and nerve degeneration ( Schmitz and Muller, 1991 ). Lens MLBs in the nucleus may signal a pathological condition that could have been initiated years earlier. Persons with a high incidence of MLBs may be candidates for age-related nuclear cataract formation. In order for the aging lens to remain transparent, fiber cells must repair oxidative damage, such as membrane ruptures, damaged proteins and vacuoles due to loss of water and protein fragments. Because mature lens fiber cells have no organelles, no ability to generate mitochondrial energy or synthesize proteins and no lysosomal defense system, they must employ unusual means to combat cellular damage. It is hypothesized that MLBs form as a cellular repair mechanism, collecting damaged membrane and possibly sequestering altered proteins ( Vrensen et al., 1990 ). In this sense they are an unusual replacement for secondary lysosomes or autophagosomes that are not completely removed from the cell ( Hariri et al., 2000 ). Ironically, while these MLBs serve as a protective device, they may also contribute to the development of a pathological condition with aging by transforming into the light scattering particles that cause cataract ( Vrensen, 1991; Gilliland et al., 2001 ). Other changes in the membranes or cytoplasm may also contribute to scattering. As the cytoplasm changes with age, the MLB interiors may change differently because they are isolated by their lipid coats. The result, perhaps over decades of change, is the formation of refractive index gradients around the MLBs that result in particles with very high scattering efficiency.

The pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectra of the two grass species Phleum pratense and Lolium multiflorum were similar insofar as signals characteristic of lignin dimers and phytosterols dominated at higher masses and for mono-and polysaccharides at lower masses. The most prominent differences between overand underground plant constituents were indicated by higher relative abundances of lignin dimers in the stems and leaves and of sugars and suberin-derived phytosterols in the roots. In the investigation of the influence of mineral to organic matter ratios, comparatively weak effects of the inorganic matrix were obtained: firstly, in the lower mass range (m/z<250), secondly, for organic matter concentrations between 1.0% and 2.0%, and thirdly, for certain classes of compounds such as phenols, alkanes/alkenes, N heterocycles and mono-and polysaccharides. The qualitative differences in the molecular composition of soil organic matter were clearly attributed to its rapid increase during the first 7 years of the experiment and largely originated from a relative enrichment of lignin dimers. Then, in the period of steady-state soil organic matter levels, dynamic changes were indicated by slight enrichments of mono-and polysaccharides, alkanes/alkenes, fatty acids, N heterocycles, and fluctuating data for phenols/lignin monomers, lignin dimers, and the sum of N compounds. Alkylaromatics showed a steep increase between the 13th and 19th years and remained then on a high level.",,
5fd584c7a4e4c3c831ab3692,Temporal changes of the C-14 reservoir effect in lakes,,"[{'name': 'MA Geyh'}, {'name': 'U Schotterer'}, {'name': 'M Grosjean'}]","Conventional radiocarbon dates for sediment samples from aquatic systems and of coeval terrestrial samples deviate from each other due to the reservoir effect. The reservoir correction is usually assumed to be constant with time for a specific aquatic system. Our studies confirm that seasonal and secular changes are frequent and are governed by the limnological conditions. Lakes have two principal sources of C-14: atmospheric CO2 and the total dissolved inorganic carbon (TDIC) of the entering groundwater and runoff. The former has values of ca. 100 pMC; the latter usually has a C-14 value well below 100 pMC. Atmospheric CO2 enters the lake by exchange via its surface. The proportions of these two kinds of input determine the magnitude of the reservoir correction in freshwater lakes. It is mainly a function of the volume/surface ratio of the lake and, consequently a function of the water depth. The surface of lakes with outflow does not change when sedimentation decreases the depth of the water. The depth of Schleinsee Lake in southern Germany has decreased from 30 to 15 m since ca. 9000 BP. As a result, the reservoir correction has decreased from ca. -1550 to -580 yr. In contrast, the depth of Lake Proscansko in Croatia increased with growth of the travertine dam and the reservoir correction changed from ca. -1790 to -2650 yr during the last 8800 yr. The largest fluctuations of lake levels occur in closed lakes in arid regions when the climate changes from humid to arid and vies versa. As a result, the reservoir correction of the C-14 dates for the total organic fraction from Lejia Lake in the Atacama Desert of Chile varied between <-1800 yr and -4700 yr over a period of only 1800 yr between 11,500 and 9700 BP. The corresponding reservoir correction for the marl fraction is much higher. In summary, accurate and reliable C-14 dating of lake sediments requires a study of the temporal changes of the reservoir effect by analysis of both the organic and marl fractions. The most reliable C-14 dates are obtained from terrestrial plant remains.",,

These sequences have been studied for their facies associations, petrographic, and diagenetic attributes in four localities: (1) Dongargaon hill, (2) Dongargaon nala, (3) Dhamni/Pavna and (4) Bijoli/Sagra. Four facies associations -(a) lacustrine-A, (b) lacustrine-B, (c) overbank with minor sheetwash deposits and (d) minor channels have been recognized by previous workers as well as in this study. An upsection shallowing trend is inferred. Petrographic studies resulted in the identification of two types of sandstones in the minor channel facies - one composed largely of calcrete grains and the other composed of quartzose grains. Diagenetic structures and fabrics of significance include septarian concretions and radiaxial fibrous calcite; and pedodiagenetic structures include mainly calcrete nodules and rhizocretions. The septarian concretions show a bimineralic character with a dolomicrite groundmass and a coarse crystalline spar filling up the cracks. Stable isotope composition of the calcrete nodules suggests a possible dual origin i.e., phreatic-pedogenic. Marl, calcareous siltstone and ostracods of the lacustrine facies range in values from -2.9parts per thousand to -6.4parts per thousand for delta(13)C and -2.7parts per thousand to -5.9parts per thousand for delta(18)O, and suggest marked fluctuations in the lake's hydrological regime. Facies analysis, petrographic studies and stable isotope compositional data of selected carbonate facies and fabrics suggests that the Lameta Formation of the Dongargaon area is dominated by overbank and shallow lake environments. This contrasts with the dominance of palustrine and pond facies described previously from the Lameta Formation of the type locality of Jabalpur in Central India.",,

The lower Vaca Muerta Formation is the deposit of a basinal to outer ramp environment, characterised by a cyclic arrangement of siliciclastic and carbonate fall-out sediments, with sporadic incursions of very distal storm-induced orbital and gravitational flows. A high nutrient input supported a diverse biota, with exceptionally abundant phytoplankton, and nektonic invertebrate and vertebrate fauna. Fourteen remains of off-shore top pelagic predators (ichthyosaurs, pliosaurs and metriorhynchid crocodiles), including some of the largest Tithonian-Berriasian marine reptiles, were found in an area of 2.1 km(2), and are here presented and described. The high rate of planktonic productivity, combined with physiographic isolation, low surrounding relief and dry climatic conditions favoured the stagnation of sea water, the generation of a thermo-pycnocline and the development of anoxic bottom conditions in the basinal and outer ramp portions of the basin. Excellent preservation of reptile skeletons is attributed to the lack of both bottom predators and bottom currents, as well as to a soupy substrate composed of a thick column of water-saturated muds.",,

The lower predominantly sandy unit ZB1 (including subunits A, B and C, belonging to NP14al) is built up of sparsely glauconitic, relatively coarse tidal current deposits with nodule levels cemented by carbonate and silica, of which one shows slumping structures and is interpreted as a seismite. The uppermost unit ZB2 (also labelled D, belonging to NP14a2), composed of alternating thin fine sandstone bands and silty marls, represents the fill of a large channel. In the Berg-Nederokkerzeel sandpit the carbonate-rich Brussel Sand Formation is finer grained and more homogeneous. Here, the basal sand (unit A) is attributable to NP14a3 and consequently, younger than the section exposed at Zaventem. It is incised at its the top by a rather narrow erosive gully, filled in with well-sorted fine sand rich in washed-in molluscs (unit B), some of which seem to point to a brackish influence. The extreme top is made up of half a meter of sand with abundant Callianassa burrows and echinid fragments (unit C). From the nannofossil data it appears that, east of Brussels, at least two generations of tidal channel systems seem to have occurred within the Brussel Sand Formation, followed by a partial emersion at the end of the filling of the uppermost channel (Nederokkerzeel B). This was succeeded by a relative sea-level rise, as shown by unit C and the remains of a completely eroded fully marine deposit, reworked in the base of the overlying Lede Sand Formation. The lowest relative sea level, with at least partial emergence of the Brussels area, occurred during middle to late Biochron NP14b. In both outcrops the Lede Sand Formation displays its characteristic pale grey relatively fine-grained homogeneous nature with a stone layer near its base. It can be concluded that, at the beginning of the ""Lede transgression"", an erosion of older deposits, containing already lifhified stone layers, occurred. This was, apparently, at least locally, caused by storms, which could redistribute, imbricate and turn over the stones, explaining their bio-perforation on both sides. Afterwards the stones have been above water for a relatively long time, enough to allow the dissolution of the perforating organisms and consequently an important oxidation of their surfaces. These stones have subsequently been colonised by a new marine fauna. Part of the shark teeth and calcareous nannofossil assemblages found in the coarse base of the Lede Sand is definitely older than the taxa normally found in the Lede Sand Formation. These fossils are the remains of a sediment package, believed to represent the formerly ""Laekenian"" stage.",,

The succession, about 65 tn thick, is constituted by marl-limestone alternations in which are intercalated numerous black shales (150). Firstly, the spatial arrangement of black shales was studied on an interval approximatively 42 m thick along a 40 km transect in order to verify the homogeneity of the succession. Secondly, a cyclostratigraphic approach was applied on the temporal distribution of black shales. The genetic significance of black levels was discussed from their petrologic characteristics (mineralogic, palynologic and geochemical). The depositional model obtained was compared with the model of deposition for the Mio-Pliocene sapropels of the Mediterranean. A temporal significance of black shales is then advanced. A potential use of the spatio-temporal distribution of these singular levels in pelagic realm is purposed.",,

In the Frontal Palmyrides the main decollement level is formed by Triassic evaporites but a Cenomanian marl interval locally forms a subsidiary decollement. Ramps linking the two decollement levels generate duplexes formed by thin horses of Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous material. To the north, in the Central Palmyrides, the decollement ramps down from a Triassic to an Eocambrian level, in which it continues as a main basal decollement. The ramp connection between the Cambrian and Triassic decollement levels is responsible for the anticlinal structure of the Central Palmyrides (Bilas block). Accurate mapping, balanced cross-sections and forward-deformation modelling allowed calculation of the amount of shortening of the sedimentary cover: the minimum estimate is 20 km. This independent, field-based result is compatible with previous estimates from a general seismic study of the Cenozoic-Mesozoic series. Due to the presence of folded Neogene deposits, the deformation of the Palmyrides belt was thought to be Miocene-Pliocene in age. However, Eocene carbonates unconformably overlie various thrust units in the Frontal Palmyrides. Reconstruction indicates 15 km of shortening during the late Maastrichtian to upper Eocene and 5 km of shortening since the Late Miocene. Thus, the main shortening event of the Palmyrides occurred during the Palaeocene. Seismic, well and gravity data are used to integrate the shallow structure in a crustal-scale deformation model. Gravity modelling confirms previous interpretations of a relatively flat Moho beneath the Palmyrides belt and suggests that deformation of the belt resulted from a movement of the sedimentary cover of northern Syria 20 km to the south, along a 200 km long, flat decollement within the Eocambrian. This Syrian decollement between the sedimentary cover and the basement is supposed to root down north of Syria, within the North Arabian plate boundary. Such a decollement implies four times more shortening in the sedimentary cover than in the Palmyrides basement.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/2E/66/94/2E669414FB0297D09A6FEDED5866B602.pdf

Units of the carbonate complex, from bottom to top, contain a bryozoan/red algal ramp, bioclastic platform, fringing-reef complex and a unit referred to as the Terminal Carbonate Complex (TCC) [1]. Lithologies from these units contain at least three components of magnetic remanence: (1) a low unblocking temperature component that is likely carried by a viscous remanent magnetization, (2) a low-coercivity, intermediate unblocking temperature component that is probably carried by magnetite or magnetite and maghemite, and (3) a high unblocking temperature component that is probably carried by hematite. Lithologies are typically dominated by the low-coercivity component and single-domain to pseudo-single-domain grain behavior. Rock-magnetic studies suggest biogenic magnetite may contribute to the magnetic remanence of the low-coercivity component. The Melilla Basin magnetostratigraphy, independently corroborated with new Ar-40/Ar-39 dating of volcanic ashes and foraminifer biostratigraphy, has been correlated to the recently developed geomagnetic polarity time scale of Shackleton et al. [2]. This correlation suggests deposition of the bioclastic platform began approximately at the Tortonian/Messinian boundary, which is defined as the base of chron 3Ar [3], and continued into chron 3An.2n. The fringing-reefs span an interval that begins in chron 3An.2n until just above the base of chron 3r (lower Gilbert). The overlying TCC and mixed carbonate and siliciclastic succession correlate to within chron 3r. The new magnetostratigraphy is not without minor ambiguities, possibly due to either remagnetization within the TCC or the presence of a short-duration normal subchron in the lower portion of chron 3r. Results of this study have important implications for correlating between Late Miocene shallow-marine carbonate sections and basinal sections within the Mediterranean Basin, for improving the understanding of the history of the Messinian Salinity Crisis, and for deciphering the roles of eustacy, tectonics, and regional processes in the development of shallow-marine carbonate sequences in the Mediterranean region.",,

The possible evolution of the ichnofossil has already been proposed by some authors, but their works concerned the very large group of trace fossils related to Zoophycos (structures that could be assigned potentially to several ichnogenera) recorded in several depositional basins. This paper focuses on the Subalpine Basin of southeastern France, where excellent outcrops facilitate the study of changes in Zoophycos that occurred between the Early Jurassic and Late Cretaceous. Thousands of specimens have been studied in detail. It appears that several trace fossils, classically related to Zoophycos, are so different that they could actually represent separate ichnogenera. But a group of them can be considered as belonging to a single ichnogenus, as they share the same morphological characters: a thin layer of bioturbated sediment (lamina), constituted by a network of primary and secondary lamellae and bordered by a marginal tube. The outline may be simple or lobate. The general architecture is a flattened cone, spirally coiled around a virtual central axis, without a vertical tunnel, and constructed upward, or, rarely, downward, in the sediment. One or several subsequent whorls are observed. The producers could have been specialized deposit feeders (sipunculans?), following a K-selected strategy. All these trace fossils are found in fine- to medium-grained limestones and marls. Inside this group, subtle differences make it possible to distinguish four morphotypes; they differ in size and how lobate they are, and they could be assigned to true ichnospecies. They succeed in time with slow and gradual changes and two trends are documented. These Zoophycos underwent evolutionary and environmental changes during the Jurassic–Cretaceous interval, becoming more lobate and larger, as they migrate to deeper and deeper environments. The four morphotypes share the same basic morphology, result from the same general activity, and are restricted to the same depositional basin. Therefore a unique clade of Mesozoic Zoophycos producers could be proposed. These animals have constructed structurally elaborate burrow systems that record complex and varied behavior. These trace fossils can also be regarded as extended phenotypes, that is adaptive projections of the organisms’ body and activity. The changes of the ichnofossils documented in the basin can thus reflect real changes in the organisms themselves and in their ethology: their phylogenetic history is mirrored to a certain extent in the succession of morphotypes. So, complex trace fossils, such as Zoophycos, are not only biosedimentary structures, but true mirrors of the evolutionary trends of their producers. This opens a new biological perspective for ichnological studies.",,

The network has now matured to achieve full Stadtbahn status; it has three routes with total length 30.5km, and 55 light rail stations in all parts of the city. A fourth line will be added in 2000, and further extensions will soon follow. Ultra-modern light rail vehicles now move fast over this smart, environmentally friendly system. The system is outstanding, even by German standards. No other city so small (population 325,000) has a fully independent Stadtbahn of its own, with light rail in tunnels through the city centre and laid on reserved track in the suburbs. The new stations have 860mm high platforms, and the tram floors have 920mm height, to facilitate easy boarding and alighting; the trams also have adjustable steps, as 16 of the stations still have low platforms. The trams can also carry bicycles. The system has retained its original 1m gauge, because it has proved so reliable, and because it prevented the need to build a second depot for public transport vehicles. All bus lines feed the Stadtbahn, run every 10min, and have excellent interchanges. The tunnel for Line 4 is being driven through layers of clay stone and stone marl, using the New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM).",,

Calvert'}, {'id': '53f46fdddabfaedf4366ab69', 'name': 'T. F. Pedersen'}]","The sedimentary geochemistry of manganese is dominated by the redox control of its speciation, higher oxidation states (Mn3+ and (4+)) occurring as insoluble oxyhydroxides in well-oxygenated environments and the lower oxidation state (Mn2+) being much more soluble in oxygen-deficient settings. Its geochemical behavior is therefore quite different in oxic and anoxic environments, and where oxic and anoxic conditions are juxtaposed, Mn is recycled between the two environments. In modern marine sediments, Mn is present above its crustal abundance as an oxyhydroxide in all slowly accumulating (pelagic) sediments of the deep ocean and in surficial deposits of continental margin environments. Diagenetic recycling of Mn in the latter causes surficial deposits to have larger Mn enrichments than in many pelagic sediments. Bottom sediments of permanently anoxic basins show no enrichments and have Mn concentrations that are controlled solely by the aluminosilicate fraction. Manganese carbonates (kutnohorite and calcic rhodochrosite) are found only in anoxic sediments accumulating beneath surface oxic horizons (and therefore under oxygenated bottom waters) in many nearshore environments. Such enrichments are due to delivery of Mn by burial of surface oxyhydroxides into the subsurface anoxic environment where they are dissolved. Pore-water Mn levels can reach saturation with respect to a mixed Mn-Ca carbonate phase in such sediments. The diagenetic origin for these phases is shown by their carbon isotope compositions, which typically indicate a carbon source from decomposing organic matter. The presence of Mn carbonates therefore signifies that the host sediment must have accumulated under oxygenated bottom waters. On the basis of this information it is proposed that, in contrast to several current explanations for the formation of Mn carbonates (kutnohorite and rhodochrosite) in ancient organic-rich shales, limestone, and marl sequences and in many Mn ore deposits, the occurrence of these mineral phases indicates that the sediments originally accumulated beneath oxygenated bottom waters. By analogy with the present, Mn carbonates could not have formed in the bottom waters of anoxic basins. These diagenetic phases, however, did form where Mn was supplied at a high rate, namely, by the burial of oxyhydroxide-enriched surface sediments, to a subsurface anoxic environment. This situation could only have occurred under oxygenated bottom waters. The presence of Mn carbonates in ancient black shales (and in some carbonate-rich rocks) lends strong support to the notion that these rocks did not necessarily form in anoxic basins but owe their carbon richness to a high supply of organic matter to sediments deposited under oxygenated bottom waters, probably in continental margin settings.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/B3/42/BC/B342BCBE9E65850024FB0F57F06380A0.pdf

I suggest that the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions can be utilised to drive a broader environmental agenda and lead to a greater emphasis on sustainability in electricity planning processes.This paper describes a proposal to deliver environmental benefits within a framework of micro-economic reform through a Market Oriented Emissions Reduction Scheme (MOERS). The MOERS is a flexible approach towards the seduction of greenhouse gas emissions which relies upon the use of market forces to determine the most economically efficient means of reducing both greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs. The principle of consumer sovereignty forms the theoretical basis for a regulatory environment in which electricity retailers determine the most cost-effective mechanisms for integrating environmental and economic objectives.

The Dogger series are represented by NNE-striking thick layers of oolitic limestones strongly disrupted by extensional structures and incipient boudinage. To the east, the overlying Priabonian (syn-rift) sequences exhibit divergent onlaps, steeply dipping intraformational unconformities and a general drag syncline geometry. These syn-depositional structures attest to a close control by the progressive tilting and normal dip-slip sliding of the Dogger strata. Interpretation of a shallow seismic reflection profile reveals that this tilting is related to an underlying master normal fault which dips 60–70° to the east. This fault offsets the Variscan crystalline basement and the gently dipping Triassic cover by about 2 km. To be balanced, the structural arrangement requires the presence of a décollement layer located between the top of the Triassic series and the Dogger series, corresponding to the Late Triassic incompetent gypsiferous clays and marls. The response of the competent Dogger to the imposed forced folding is through the development of a large-scale extensional syncline in the hangingwall of the master detachment, compensated by the development of a piggy-back half-graben in the footwall. In the light of this new interpretation, a mechanical hypothesis is proposed including a two-stage evolution model of extension and subsidence for the Rhine graben.",,

Moreover, sedimentological and micropaleontological data are also provided for the northern and central part. Sedimentological study enables recognition of 12 microfacies ranging from open marine below storm wave action to supratidal with continental influx. The proposed model is that of a homoclinal ramp marl-sandstone-limestone interrupted by numerous tempestites. Sedimentary cycles in the Late Visean are particularly numerous. Calcareous algae are mostly Stacheiinae and benthic foraminifers, Archaediscidae and Endothyridae. The prolific Late Visean assemblages become scarce in the Serpukhovian and peter out in the Bashkirian. This reflects the progression from a marine ramp to a paralic basin.

Caixeta'}, {'name': 'Talles S. Ferreira'}, {'name': 'Délzio L. Machado'}, {'name': 'Janaína L. Teixeira'}, {'name': 'Marco A. T. Romeiro'}]","The progress of petroleum exploration toward ultra-deep waters along the Eastern Brazilian coast resulted in the acquisition of seismic reflection data with records as deep as 30 km (18 sec TWT), making possible drilling of exploration wells in the distal portion of Northeastern Brazilian Rifted Margin (NBRM). The interpretation of this dataset allowed not only the visualization of an Albian marine rift system along the NBRM, but also the identification of the boundary between continental and oceanic crusts, and their internal structures. The rheological behavior of the upper and lower continental crusts controlled the geometry of rifted blocks, showing brittle or ductile deformation patterns, from high angle faulted blocks to rotated ones. Along the NBRM, the Albian rifting shows half-grabens with flip-flop and magmatic features such as sills and dykes sometimes related to a broad SDR’s domain. Aptian salt diapirs are deformed within some distal Albian grabens suggesting that rifting occurred after the deposition of the Aptian salt. The Albian rift system exhibits wide variation of structural style and amount of associated magmatism. In the central portion of the NBRM, the Jacuípe and Sergipe-Alagoas basins are characterized by widespread magmatism represented by large intrusions and magmatic flows (SDRs). Further north, the Pernambuco-Paraíba Basin presents a typical half-graben geometry associated with huge igneous features. The Albian age of the distal rift system was confirmed by pillow basalts (identified by resistivity image logging) interbedded with rift sediments. Moreover, samples of the pillow basalts were dated by 40 Ar/ 39 Ar around 104 Ma, correlated to magmatic bodies that crop out in the onshore Pernambuco-Paraíba Basin, which range from 94-102 Ma ( 40 Ar/ 39 Ar). We speculate that structures may be related to deep-water extrusive and intrusive magmatic features mapped in deep reflection seismic sections. Furthermore, organic-rich marine shales were also drilled in the Albian rift system, attesting the presence of source rocks to Upper Cretaceous oil fields recently discovered in the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin. Therefore, the architecture of the Albian rift system plays an important role in understanding the tectonic evolution of the Northeastern Brazilian Rifted Margin and its associated marine petroleum system. The Northeastern Brazilian Rifted Margin (NBRM): An Odd Puzzle The Northeast Brazilian Rifted Margin (NBRM) comprises the northern portion of the East Brazilian Margin (EBM) where are located the Jequitinhonha-Almada-Camamu (Ferreira et al., 2013), Sergipe-Alagoas and Pernambuco-Paraíba rift basin sets (Figure 1A). The NBRM is limited southwards in the Jequitinhonha Basin by the Cenozoic Abrolhos magmatic complex, and northwards by the Equatorial Brazilian Margin tip the Touros structural high in the Potiguar Basin. Unlike the southern part of the EBM, which is well studied due to the recent presalt petroleum discoveries in the Campos, Santos and Espírito Santo basins, the distal part of NBRM remains poorly known, despite of the recent discovery of a petroleum province related to Upper Cretaceous turbidites in Sergipe-Alagoas Basin. Recent works (Caixeta et al., 2009, 2012; Ferreira et al., 2011; Ferreira and Caixeta, 2012) have argued the NBRM underwent a quite distinct tectonic evolution of the rest of the EBM. New seismic reflection data with records as deep as 30 km (18 sec TWT), associated with geological information from some exploration wells in the distal portion of the NBRM, have brought great advances to understanding the tectonic evolution of the EBM. By means of interpretation of deep seismic sections it was observed that some well-established geological concepts about the breakup process in the EBM are outdated. A good example is to use the deposition of Aptian evaporites as a regional mark for ending of the rifting and the beginning of a widespread thermal stage along the entire EBM. This assumption might be useful for the southern portion of the EBM (basically Campos and Santos basins), but definitely can no longer be applied in the NBRM. Thus, the NBRM presents an odd tectonic story within a long-standing breakup model for the splitting up of the South American and African supercontinents. The Marine Magmatic Albian Rifting: The Missing Piece of the Puzzle The rifting process along the NBRM can be told in a single story (a common genetic tectonic story) composed by several chapters (poly phase rifting) where the characters (the basins) alternated a final chapter that was unknown (the Albian rifting). Now, this final chapter is played due to advancement of the petroleum exploration frontier toward ultra-deep waters. The earliest rifting in the Northeastern Brazilian coast occurred during Neocomian-Barremian times, with the onshore Reconcavo-Tucano-Jatoba rift system as its best example. During the Neo-Aptian, the NBRM began to develop its current framework through the linkage of isolated large grabens or basin depocenters strongly bounded by basement lineaments (e.g. Vaza-Barris). Some wells record more than 1 km of Aptian rift sediments in the Camamu, Almada and PernambucoParaíba basins. From the Mid-Aptian, the rift architecture changed with the formation of conspicuous hinge faults basinward in Camamu, Almada and Pernambuco-Paraíba basins, while other areas such as Sergipe-Alagoas and Jequitinhonha had progressively less fault activity with initiation of thermal subsidence, known as SAG phase that was widespread until the Neo-Aptian when the Gondwana breakup had taken place. During this period the deposition of evaporites occurred which would mark the beginning of the drift phase. Until the last decade, the tectonic story of the EBM could be briefly told this way. However, recently some deepwater wells located in Sergipe-Alagoas and Almada basins revealed an Albian rift system with a stratigraphic section very similar along the NBRM, basically dominated by marine pelites. A representative Albian rift section can be described by shale and marls interbedded with limestones and volcanics in the uppermost section. In contrast to the sandy Aptian rift section, which ends the proximal continental rifting, the distal Albian rift shows fine sediments deposited under the influence of widespread shallow marine environment. Moreover, the Albian rift system displays a wide variability of structural styles and amount of magmatism along the NBRM. In the southern portion of the NBRM, half-graben sets occur with flip-flop geometry, mostly showing synthetic curved normal faults and associated magmatic features (sills and dykes) primarily within the uppermost section. On the other hand, the northern basins (from Jacuípe Basin northwards) are strongly controlled by magmatic flows which form antithetic curved normal faults that sometimes can be simply described as a SDR domain. The growth of the rift section occurs up to the Albian top, whereas the uppermost section of Cenomanian-Turonian age displays a SAG geometry (here named as SAG II) without significant fault control (Figrue 1B).Thus, the Albian rifting took place in the distal margin associated with magmatic rocks dated around 104 Ma ( 40 Ar/ 39 Ar) in the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin as well as is clearly characterized by resistivity image logging displaying pillow basalts with associated meso-scale columnar basalt structures (Figure 2). Furthermore, thin section petrographic analysis confirmed that magmatic rocks were formed by submarine flows interbedded with Albian-Cenomanian clastic rift sediments (Figrue 3). According to our model, the conjugate margin to the southern NBRM is the Gabon Basin which is characterized by a flip-flop basin pattern, marked by the Aptian salt level. The southern NBRM-Gabon Basin clearly presents a distal Albian rift basin toward the mid-ocean ridge. The salt is not common within Albian distal basins which might suggest an elevated area in that period of higher heat flow. The cooling that followed the period of heating formed a distal SAG basin during the Albian-Cenomanian, resulting in a favorable environment for organic matter preservation (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Diachronic Breakup in the NBRM: From the Albian to the Cenomanian The regional integrated interpretation of the NBRM (Ferreira et al., 2011; Ferreira and Caixeta, 2012) has shown that the rifting process goes on beyond the Aptian, and displays a distinct thermal phase over time. The latest rift pulses were strongly controlled by conspicuous basement lineaments (e.g. Vaza Barris, Pernambuco, Itabuna-Itaju do Colônia) which led and compartmentalized the rift propagation until the Gondwana breakup (Figure 6). In contrast to the southern part of the EBM, the thinning crust process in the NBRM was influenced by several distinct Archean-Proterozoic basement terranes such as São Francisco-Congo Craton, Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif, and Araçuaí and Sergipana fold belts. Such basement diversity reflected in different magmatic and structural styles along of the NBRM due to the wide variation of rheological behaviors during thinning and extension of the crust. The NBRM shows large variation of structural styles from short to hyper-extended margins. The central part displays short margins formed basically by necking zones in the Camamu and Jacuípe basins associated with the São Francisco-Congo Craton basement. At the southern tip, a broad margin was developed in Almada and Jequitinhonha basins, under influence of the Araçuaí fold belt. On the other hand, the northern portion presents a hyper-extended margin associated with widespread magmatism in the Sergipe-Alagoas and Pernambuco-Paraíba basins. There is clear northwards increase of the magmatism related to the breakup. All these evidence reinforces the puzzling breakup process for this part of the EBM. Along the whole distal NBRM the Albian magmatic rift system occurs in response to hyper-extension of crust just",,

To provide a tracable set of base data for an exhaustive remediation program, thorough geological, geomorphological and geotechnical studies and a detailed monitoring program were accomplished. This article presents some of the most important facts and implications of the above investigations, which were fundamental in stabilizing this huge earth- and debris flow. The Gschliefgraben, an E-W trending valley, is located at the tectonic border between the Rhenodanubian Flysch and the Ultrahelvetics with predominately marls and sandstones, and the Northern Calcareous Alps with mainly limestones and dolomites. During the Holocene era, this tectonically overprinted mix of competent and incompetent as well as impermeable and highly permeable rocks gave rise to episodic landslide. In the Gschliefgraben area multiple refraction and reflection seismic profiles were measured in several field campaigns lasting over five years. The reflection seismic data were processed using refraction processing after Palmer and the refraction tomography method, with a focus on the suitability of seismic refraction profiles for detecting the basement of landslides. Several horizons were interpreted on these refraction profiles representing changes in velocity but without layer boundaries. These horizons were used to build a three-dimensional model of the subsurface. Surface-related GPS and terrestrial surveying results were combined by geostatistical space-time interpolation, yielding a consistent process model that documents a stepwise cessation of displacements in the light of weather conditions and mitigation measures. Adapted from the above studies, a multiple layer geotechnical model of the soil could be developed which was the basis for defining the mitigation measures that finally lead to stabilizing the landslide motions.

The oldest sediment yielded a (14)C age of 8540 +/- 220 years BP Four stratigraphic diatom zones were defined based on relative abundance of diatom taxa, physical characteristics of sediments, and clustering of diatom samples using principal component analysis. Diatom zone 4 (440-390 cm) contains an assemblage of mostly benthic-alkalibiontic forms that suggest the formation of a shallow fen or artesian seep ecosystem with high alkalinity. Diatom zone 3 (389-230 cm) is marked by an increase in the relative abundance of planktonic diatoms and a diverse diatom assemblage. Diatom zone 3 averages similar to 50 diatom taxa per interval, planktonic diatoms average > 60 %, and several rare taxa are present in the diatom assemblage. This diversity suggests that a variety of aquatic habitats were present in Lake Apopka during this time period. The diverse benthic-alkalibiontic diatom flora that characterized Lake Apopka through much of the late Holocene declines with the transition from diatom zone 2 (230-129) to modern unconsolidated sediments (Diatom zone 1, 129 cm to the sediment surface). Our diatom-based study provides further support for the argument that the current trophic state of Lake Apopka was brought about by human-mediated nutrient additions. Below 130 cm in the Apopka core, sediments display a combination of marl layers interspersed with sand, peat, lacustrine gyttja and abundant macrophyte plant remains. The contrast between these ancient sediment types, with more diverse diatom floras and modern sediments with reduced diatom species diversity, suggests that human modifications to the Lake Apopka ecosystem are primarily responsible for the hyper-eutrophic conditions.",,

It recorded the global oceanic anoxic event (OAE 2) that occurred at the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary. The type section of the Wadi Bahloul comprises 29 m of sediment showing a regular repetition of an elementary depositional sequence including black, thinly-bedded limestones and bioturbated gray marls. These sedimentological fluctuations define two trophic states of the palaeoenvironment. The laminated black limestones are associated with eutrophic conditions in the water column above an anoxic basin, while oligotrophic and at least temporarily oxic conditions at the sediment/water interface prevailed during the deposition of the bioturbated grey marls. Each lithological cycle reflects short-term climatic fluctuations: arid conditions are associated with the deposition of the black laminated limestones, whereas the grey marls correspond to sub-humid conditions. These environmental changes are interpreted as being related to precession cycles of 20 ky. According to the number of precession cycles identified in the section of the type locality, the Bahloul Formation probably was deposited during one eccentricity cycle of 400 ky. This cyclostratigraphic interpretation, calibrated by biostratigraphy, constrains the duration of the anoxic event more precisely than radiometric ages which suggest a duration of 500 +/- 400 ky.",,

And, in fact, at present man depends on grasses either by direct use as food, or via animals. Furthermore, grasses are being used as clothing and for cover. And many enjoy looking at the use of grasses, either on or near the sport field, or behind the TV screen. Others use grasses for other recreational purposes. The author, a well-known grass specialist, has compiled much information on grasses, with special attention to subjects as grass diversity, assumption of form, panicles, spikelet and florets, dispersal, taxonomy and photosynthesis. In the chapter Domestication we find information of classic and biotech breeding of grasses. In a paragraph called ‘elginism’,mention is made of the ownership of genes. Who owns the genes? The community where the plants are/were growing or the collector. The author admits that the term ‘elginism’ is not a correct one, as this term refers to the ‘marbles’ collected by Lord Elgin in the ruins of the Parthenon. Each sculpture is unique, whereas “domesticated’ genes of some Near East cereals have been multiplied some 12000 times. The last chapter deals with maize. In this chapter the crop development has been put to light. In one paragraph he compares maize and perennial teosinte with Old English and Norman French. Due to the absorption of the latter in the first with time the present day English developed to become a world language. A comparable development can be recognized with maize and perennial teosinte, genes of the latter enriched the genetic composition of Old Maize to become the worldwide grown present day maize. However, other factors and vectors play a role in the spread of a language and that of a crop. However, the diversity of English resulted in the use of the term corn for maize on page 216, other than in technical terms such as ‘San Pablo corn’, and ‘corn moulds’. The book provides much technical data on grasses and these have been larded with interesting information such as mentioned above, and for instance on the different uses of the sites where the French and British put the tons of marl excavated of the Channel Tunnel. By the way, these sites will not be covered by grasses only.

The untreated and “desulphurized” (CrCl2 and Li/EtNH2) kerogens were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by flash pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Typically, significant variations in the relative contributions and abundances of n-alk-1-enes/n-alkanes, alkylated pyrroles, thiophenes and supposedly S-bound moieties released as phytenes and sterenes were observed. The first series of products (n-hydrocarbons) contributed relatively more to the pyrolyzates of the desulphurized kerogens, suggesting an enrichment of microalgal-derived aliphatic macromolecules. These marine micro-organisms are thought to belong in part to the class of Eustigmatophyceae. Alkylated pyrroles were barely detectable in the untreated kerogen pyrolyzates, whereas they contributed significantly to those from the treated kerogens.

However, Li/EtNH2 treatment reduced the porphyrin standard, such that it could generate mainly monopyrroles upon pyrolysis.

Abstract. TRILOBITESFROMTHE VOLCANCITO FORMATION (FILO AZUL MEMBER, LATE CAMBRIAN) OFTHE FAMATINA SYSTEM, LA RIOJA, ARGENTINA: SYSTEMATICSANDPALEOENVIRONMENTS. The Filo Azul Member of the Volcancito Formation (Famatina range, La Rioja, Argentina) consists of a lower part (30 m) of thinly laminated marls and calcareous shales with intercalations of fine-grained sandstones, a middle part (85 m) of massive middle to thick-grained calcareous sandstones, and an upper part (50 m) of shales with interbedded layers of fine sandstones. Previous studies on trilobites, graptolites and conodonts assigned the section to the Upper Cambrian-Lower Ordovician. The lower portion of the member (Parabolina frequens argentina Biozone, lower part) contains a diverse trilobite fauna that was studied by Harrington and Leanza in the 1950s. Since then, new collections have been obtained, which are the subject of the present study. New polymerid trilobites, originally described on the basis of scarce material, are re-illustrated (Onychopyge riojana Harrington, Asaphellus riojanus Harrington and Leanza, Rhadinopleura eurycephala Harrington and Leanza, Plicatolina scalpta Harrington and Leanza) and the assignations of several taxa are reconsidered (Angelina cf. hyeronimi (Kayser), Parabolinella sp. 1, Parabolinella sp. 2, Pseudokainella tosellii sp. nov., Conophrys sp.) (since the agnostoids have been recently revised, they are not included in this study). The fauna comprises several endemic species. On the other hand, the occurrence of Parabolina (Neoparabolina) frequens (Barrande) permits the outcrop to be correlated with other Upper Cambrian sections. The abundance of nutrients in the sea bottom must have favoured the development of a diverse trilobite community, which included different morphotypes and feeding habits. Several taxa were especially adapted to live under low-oxygen conditions, probably in symbiosis with sulfur bacteria.",,

The shocked minerals represent impact ejecta from the 74-Ma Manson impact structure (MIS). This study was aimed at determining the bulk chemical compositions and analysis of planar deformation features (PDFs) of shocked quartz; for the basal and marly units of the Crow Creek Member. We studied samples from the Gregory 84-21 core, Iroquois core and Wakonda lime quarry. Contents of siderophile elements are generally high, but due to uncertainties in the determination of Ir and uncertainties in compositional sources for Cr, Co, and Ni, we could not confirm an extraterrestrial component in the Crow Creek Member. We recovered several shocked quartz grains from basal-unit samples, mainly from the Gregory 84-21 core, and results of PDF measurements indicate shock pressures of at least 15 GPa. All the samples are composed chiefly of SiO2 (2958 wt%), Al2O3 (614 wt%), and CaO (730 wt%). When compared to the composition of North American Shale Composite, the samples are significantly enriched in CaO, P2O5, Mn, Sr, Y, U, Cr, and Ni. The contents of rare earth elements (REE), high field strength elements (HFSE), Cr, Co, Sc, and their ratios and chemical weathering trends, reflect both felsic and basic sources for the Crow Creek Member, an inference, which is consistent with the lithological compositions in the environs of the MIS. The high chemical indices of alteration and weathering (CIA and CIW: 7599), coupled with the Al2O3-(CaO*+Na2O)-K2O (A-CN-K) ratios, indicate that the Crow Creek Member and source rocks had undergone high degrees of chemical weathering. The expected ejecta thicknesses at the sampled locations (409 to 219 km from Manson) were calculated to range from about 1.9 to 12.2 cm (for the present-day crater radius of Manson), or 0.4 to 2.4 cm (for the estimated transient cavity radius). The trend agrees with the observed thicknesses of the basal unit of the Crow Creek Member, but the actually observed thicknesses are larger than the calculated ones, indicating that not all of the basal unit comprises impact ejecta.",,

An analysis of seasonal changes was carried out and, on the example of a dam reservoir (Turawa Big Reservoir), a multi-point analysis of the distribution of ion concentrations in water at the reservoir surface was also carried out. It was shown that retention and flow-through reservoirs, where the main source of pollution is the water feeding the reservoirs, are the most vulnerable to pollution. The second group consists of closed reservoirs located in industrial and agricultural areas, which are exposed to pollution from rainwater run-off and field leachate. In the case of reservoirs created in marl mining areas, a significant effect was also indicated from the chemical composition of the substrate on the formation of ionic equilibria in waters filling the excavations. The research shows that there are no hard and fast rules regarding the seasonal variability of ion concentrations during the growing season, indicating that eutrophic reservoirs show greater variability of ion concentration.",,

A particular aspect in Romania is related to the frequent occurrence of salt. It is to be mentioned that Romania contains the largest salt resources/reserves throughout Europe. This potential of about three billion tons could supply salt for the whole world population for over four hundred years. Telega village, separated by Campina town through Doftana River, is situated at 5 km from it, in the west part of Prahova County. The village covers a medium altitude relief (550m), characterized by irregularities of ground, many valleys and swales crossed by streams. On the left bank of Telega valley, the landslides' effects have a large extension, in some places being catastrophic. Among these, the one called at ""Butoi"" area presents a huge interest according of their produced destructions and because of the influence on Telega Spa, main communal road etc. In the above-mentioned sector, the slope is badly affected over a 0.4 sqkm surface. The morphology presents many scars, sometimes with steeps, waves with variable amplitudes and counter slope aspects in which water accumulates as lakes and swamps, with transversal and longitudinal fissures with different lengths and depths. The slope is very steep, especially in crest area. Besides the covering deluvial, clayey, yellow-gray quaternary rocks, other rocks form the basement are moving, in the detachment area marly, gray-black, fine stratified, sandy rocks interbeded with soft, gray sandstones of Meotian age are affected. Also, the rocks of the ""salt breccias horizon"" of Badenian age are affected. Predominantly are gray-purple marls with breccias aspect with white-gray large crystallized lens of salt. The whole stack of sediments is trapped into a very complex structure crossed by Campina-Cosminele fault and flanked NE by Martin fault. The salt presence influences land's instability phenomena occurrence. The water's circulation is made through the gritty and sandy horizons (layers), with a relatively large development. The permeability and the porosity of these rocks vary depending on the lithologic constitution of the respectively stratigraphic layer. The geoelectric investigation outlines horizontally the sliding area, and vertically the elements of the landslide surface - position, depth, shape, and the bedrock's relief. The quantitative interpretation of the resistivity geoelectrical vertical tests, and the correlation with the geological structure identified 3 sliding surfaces, from which only the upper one (2-6m depth) was known before the stability works. There were localized the rainfall waters circulation and accumulation zones, areas with high sliding risk Same results were obtained in sliding zones, been localized the principal elements of the landslides, with practical implications in land instability and estimation of the evolution of the destructive phenomena mechanisms.

The curvature of the fold belt follows the Caucasus which may imply a phase of oroclinal bending. In order to test whether the fold curvature represents a phase of oroclinal bending, a paleomagnetic study has been carried out in the Eastern Pontides on late Cretaceous and middle Eocene volcanic and sedimentary rocks from 29 sites. Rock magnetic studies reveal medium-temperature components with an unblocking temperature of 400–580 °C, indicating pseudo-single domain titanomagnetite as the most abundant carrier of magnetic remanence in the middle Eocene rocks studied here. In the upper Cretaceous rocks, a high-temperature component with an unblocking range of 580–650 °C was isolated. Stepwise thermal and alternating field demagnetization isolated two components of remanent magnetization in middle Eocene rocks comprising a low unblocking temperature/coercivity component near the present field direction and a characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) component of D s = 332.3°, I s = 49.9° ( k = 33.3, α 95 = 9.2°, N = 15 sites). A positive fold test at a 95% confidence level and a reversal test indicate a primary magnetization. Component analysis of the upper Cretaceous rocks identifies a stable ChRM D s = 160.3°, I s = −45.0°, ( k =  85.6, α 95 = 6.0°, N =  8 sites) following removal of secondary remanence. Their ChRM direction passes fold and reversal tests at a 95% confidence level. Both the upper Cretaceous and middle Eocene paleomagnetic data from the Eastern Pontides and the Lesser Caucasus clearly demonstrate evidence of oroclinal bending that occurred contemporaneouslywith the convergence between Arabia and Eurasia in the Paleocene. Keywords Paleomagnetic Eastern Pontides Upper Cretaceous rocks Middle Eocene Oroclinal bending 1 Introduction The Eastern Pontides (EP) ( Fig. 1 ) are one of the best preserved large mountain belts, 500 km long and 100 km wide. Its western boundary corresponds to the Western Pontides (WP) and its northeast boundary is marked by the Achara-Trialet belt (ATB), whereas the Great Caucasus (GC) lies to its north and the Taurides to the south ( Fig. 1 ). Thrusts and fold-axes observed in the east of Lesser Caucasus (LC) ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) are characterized by NW-SE directions ( Bazhenov and Burtman, 2002; Banks and Robinson, 1997 ) and are parallel to the thrust faults observed in the GC ( Forte et al., 2010; Philip et al., 1989 ). These parallel structures show deviations from the E-W thrust and fold directions of the ATB ( Banks and Robinson, 1997 ) to the south of the EP back-arc basin where the thrust directions are roughly in a NE-SW direction ( Okay and Şahintürk, 1997 ). All these major structures roughly define an oroclinal bending extending along the LC through the EP. The Izmir-Ankara-Erzincan Suture (IAES), separating Eurasia to the north from Gondwanan fragments to the south, is a more than 1000 km long belt that merges with the Sevan-Akera suture in LC further east. The suture makes a large loop in Central Anatolia and trends E-W further east, delimiting the southern boundary of the (EP) ( Fig. 2 ). The direction of subduction along the IAES was dominantly northward in Late Mesozoic ( Şengör and Yılmaz, 1981; Okay and Şahintürk, 1997; Ustaömer and Robertson, 1997; Rice et al., 2006, 2009 ); a thick sequence of arc-type volcanics and plutonic rocks were emplaced upon the EP crust in response to northward subduction of Tethys in Late Mesozoic time ( Adamia et al., 1977; Akın, 1978; Şengör and Yılmaz, 1981; Okay and Şahintürk, 1997; Okay and Tüysüz, 1999; Boztug, 2009 ). A rifted volcanic arc and marginal basins were also formed within the Tethys, inboard the EP arc ( Tüysüz, 1990; Ustaömer and Robertson, 1997; Rice et al., 2006, 2009 ). The middle Eocene magmatism in EP produced a large belt of E–W trending volcanics towards Iran and Caucasus ( Kazmin et al., 1986 ). Previous studies have generally postulated that the middle Eocene magmatism in the EP is extension-related as a result of the opening of the eastern Black Sea basin ( Zonenshain and Le Pichon, 1986; Görür, 1988; Dercourt et al., 1993; Okay et al., 1994; Spadini et al., 1996; Banks and Robinson, 1997; Görür and Tuysuz, 1997; Robinson et al., 1995; Ustaömer and Robertson, 1997 ). It was initially inferred from the paleomagnetic study carried out in the LC by Bazhenov and Burtman (2002) that the fold axes observed in the Pontides and LC present an oroclinal bending. The authors demonstrated this with middle Eocene volcanoclastic rocks of twelve reliable paleomagnetic directions and previously published late Cretaceous paleomagnetic data ( Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, in the EP, it was noted that the paleomagnetic data were poor. A mechanism was proposed in which the bending of the LC-EP arc formed as a result of a south to north convergence of the African and Eurasian plates. There are several published paleomagnetic studies of late Cretaceous and middle Eocene rocks in the EP arc ( Fig. 1 , Table 1 ). Previous paleomagnetic studies of upper Cretaceous rocks in the EP focused mainly on understanding their paleolatitudinal drift ( Van der Voo, 1968; Orbay and Bayburdi, 1979; Channell et al., 1996; Çinku et al., 2010 ). The first paleomagnetic survey dedicated to Turkish tectonics was conducted by Van der Voo (1968) who, as early as 1968, obtained paleomagnetic directions from upper Cretaceous sites (17a and 17b in Table 1 and Fig. 1 , D = 157.5°, I = 38.1°, α 95 = 9.4°; D = 169.4°, I = −40°, α 95 = 8.8°). Later Orbay and Bayburdi (1979) sampled from upper Cretaceous volcanics (location number 18 in Table 1 and Fig. 1 ). In the EP the most detailed study was carried out by Channell et al. (1996) who found a mean inclination of 43.7°, with no significant rotations (location number 16 in Table 1 and Fig. 1 ). All of these results consistently documented counterclockwise rotations between 4° and 24° since the late Cretaceous. Paleomagnetic studies from middle Eocene rocks are also in limited numbers among Trabzon and Samsun in the EP (for reference see Table 1 , Fig. 1 ), indicating consistent counterclockwise rotations varying between 15° and 30° (location numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5 in Fig. 1 and Table 1 ) and a low inclination between 35° and 40° (5 and 6 locations) ( Fig. 1 ). Despite the lack of paleomagnetic data in the EP supporting an oroclinal bending model, a good fit can be seen from folds and thrust structures in the region. However, the mechanism and timing of such oroclinal bending is still not understood. For this purpose, a paleomagentic study has been carried out in the EP from middle Eocene and late Cretaceous volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The new results coincide with the view of Bazhenov and Burtman (2002) and is discussed below to constrain the mechanism of oroclinal bending and its timing. 2 Geological setting and paleomagnetic sampling A number of studies have been carried out in the EP that focused on the stratigraphy and the tectonic evolution of the region ( Ağar, 1977; Akdeniz, 1988; Robinson et al., 1995; Okay and Şahintürk, 1997; Yılmaz et al., 1997; Rice et al., 2009 ). The metamorphic basement is composed of a chaotic rock-assemblage ( Adamia, 1982; Robinson et al., 1995; Okay and Şahintürk, 1997 ) ( Fig. 4 b and c ). Volcano-sedimentary rocks as well as sediments of Jurassic age ( Ağar, 1977; Robinson et al., 1995 ) lie unconformably on the basement rocks ( Figs. 3 and 4 b), in turn overlain conformably by middle Jurassic by volcano-sedimentary rocks and upper Jurassic and lower Cretaceous (Callovian to Barremian) limestones and carbonate rocks ( Fig. 4 b and d). In most of the northern part of the EP, Campanian limestones unconformably overlie the Jurassic carbonate rocks ( Pelin, 1977; Robinson et al., 1995 ) ( Fig. 4 c). The upper Cretaceous units indicate a deep-marine environment of deposition and volcanic rocks ( Robinson et al., 1995; Kırmacı and Akdağ, 2005 ). They are composed, in general, of andesites, rhyodacitic lavas and pyroclastic rocks, along with sandstones and sandy limestones of the Çatak–Kızılkaya–Çağlayan–Çayırbağ and Tonya formations ( Robinson et al., 1995; Kırmacı and Akdağ, 2005 ). Magmatic activity in the EP was characterized by main eruptions in the late Cretaceous (Campanian-Maastrichtian), related to island-arc volcanism (e.g., Adamia et al., 1977; Tokel, 1977; Şengör and Yılmaz, 1981; Kazmin et al., 1986; Temizel and Arslan, 2005; Arslan et al., 2009 ). The upper Cretaceous (Campanian-Maastrichtian) volcanic rocks located in the northern EP ( Figs. 3 and 4 b, d and e) are characterized by basaltic, andesitic, dacitic and rhyolitic lavas ( Eğin et al., 1979; Ercan and Gedik, 1983; Korkmaz, 1993 ) exhibit subalkaline affinity and yielding island-arc geochemical signatures ( Pecerillo and Taylor, 1975; Eğin et al., 1979; Akıncı, 1984 ). In the Central and Western Pontides, the upper Cretaceous rocks consist of pelagic limestone (Kapanboğazı Formation), tuff and minor lavas (Yemişliçay Formation), turbidites (Görsökü Formation) and the alternation of marl, siltstone and clay (Akveren Formation) ( Robinson et al., 1995 ) ( Figs. 3 and 4 a). During the middle Eocene, widespread calc-alkaline magmatic activity and shallow marine sedimentation ( Okay et al., 1994; Okay and Şahintürk, 1997 ) is recorded in the EP ( Okay et al., 1994; Okay and Şahintürk, 1997 ). The volcanic rocks were dominantly basalt and andesite lavas ( Arslan et al., 1997 ) and included in the Kabaköy ( Güven, 1993 ) and Alibaba formations ( Tokel, 1977 ). The volcanism has been explained as the product of a tensional event related to an accelerated phase of opening of the Eastern Black Sea Basin ( Okay and Şahintürk, 1997; Arslan et al., 2009 ) ( Figs. 3 and 4 b, c and e). In this study, Upper Cretaceous to middle Eocene volcanic and sedimentary rocks were collected from 29 sites ( Figs. 3 and 4 ) in the EP to understand better the existence and timing of a oroclinal bending. Upper Cretaceous basalt-andesites, and sandstones were sampled at 10 sites around the Rize-Yusufeli and Hopa regions ( Figs. 3 and 4 b, d and e). Near Samsun, fine-grained marl layers were sampled from the Maastrichtian Akveren Formation at four sites ( Figs. 3 and 4 a). Middle Eocene rocks were sampled around Gümüşhane and Yusufeli at 12 sites in volcanic lavas and sedimentary sequences from the Kabaköy Formation ( Güven, 1993 ) and the Alibaba Formation ( Tokel, 1977 ) from 3 sites near Ispir ( Figs. 3 and 4 c). A motorized portable core drill was used to collect core samples and samples were oriented using both sun and magnetic compasses. Cylindrical cores (2.4 cm diameter, 2.1 cm length) were later cut into specimens from each orientated core sample. 3 Experimental procedures For rock magnetic experiments, hysteresis loops were measured on 14 specimens up to a maximum field of 1 T using a Princeton Measurements Corporation MicroMag magnetometer. Stepwise acquisition curves of isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) were obtained with an ASC pulse magnetizer up to 1 T. The Lowrie (1990) test was performed using fields of 1.0 T ( z axis), 0.4 T ( y axis), and 0.14 T ( x axis). Samples were afterwards thermally cleaned to identify the magnetic carriers based on their coercivity and unblocking temperature behaviors. Natural remanent magnetizations (NRM) were measured using a 755R 3-axes DC-SQUID cryogenic magnetometer and a Molspin magnetometer at the Laboratory for Natural Magnetism, ETH Zürich, and Istanbul University, Turkey. Thermal demagnetization was carried out using an ASC TD48, MTD-80 furnace in 12–15 steps between room temperature and 680 °C, and alternating field (AF) demagnetization was achieved with a 2G-Enterprises degausser between 0 and 100 mT. The results of magnetic component analysis were plotted on orthogonal vector diagrams ( Zijderveld, 1967 ) and calculated using principal component analysis ( Kirschvink, 1980 ). 3.1 Magnetic mineralogy Typical examples of the isothermal remanence (IRM) acquisition curves are shown in Fig. 5 . The IRM of most of the samples shows a low coercivity component, with rapid increases in low fields resulting from the magnetite fraction. In other samples the high coercivity fraction, probably carried by titano-hematite, shows a smooth increase in remanence achieving saturation at a 0.4 T or higher field. Thermal demagnetization shows that the low coercivity component dominates the IRM in middle Eocene volcanics ( Fig. 6 a–c ). Both low and medium components are gradually unblocked between 350 and 600 °C ( Fig. 6 b and c). In some upper Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, the medium and high coercivity component is progressively unblocked up to 680 °C, typical of titano-hematite ( Fig. 6 d and e). In other samples, the low and medium coercivity components dominate the IRM with an unblocking temperature of 600 °C suggesting the existence of titano-magnetite ( Fig. 6 f). The hysteresis parameters saturation magnetization (Js), remanent saturation magnetization (Jrs), coercivity (Hc), and remanent coercivity (Hcr) on a Day plot ( Day et al., 1977 ) show mostly pseudo-single domain behaviors ( Fig. 7 a) . Hysteresis loops for most of the pilot samples have a wasp-waisted form, reflecting mixtures of high and low coercivity fractions ( Fig. 7 b). 3.2 Paleomagnetic analysis The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) intensities of the volcanic rocks varied from 400 mA/m up to 3000 mA/m, whereas the sedimentary rocks showed lower intensities, varying from 0.2 to 50 mA/m. All samples were systematically demagnetized using both thermal and alternating-field techniques ( Fig. 8 ) although thermal demagnetization was more successful in isolating the high-temperature fraction. Some upper Cretaceous volcanic samples ( Fig. 8 d) yielded unblocking temperatures above 580°C, implying that titanohematite is the main ferromagnet. In most of the upper Cretaceous volcanics and sediments, a viscous component was eliminated between 75–300 °C (100–200 Oe), and a ChRM was observed with a medium-high temperature (coercivity) component in the range 500–580 °C ( Fig. 8 a–c). In most of the volcanic rocks from the middle Eocene sites a viscous low-temperature component was eliminated by 200 °C ( Fig. 8 e and g) and yielded a paleomagnetic mean direction similar to that of the Earth's present field. The ChRM component showed a stable magnetic direction migrating to the origin with medium-high temperature (coercivity) isolated between 500 and 580 °C, or 400 and 1000 Oe ( Fig. 8 e–h). 4 Paleomagnetic results The site-mean directions from the upper Cretaceous and middle Eocene sites are listed in Table 2 and displayed in Fig. 9 . The tilt-corrected mean direction from the upper Cretaceous rocks in EP is D s = 160.3°, I s = −45.0° ( k = 85.6, α 95 = 6.0°, N = 8 sites, Table 2 , Fig. 9 b). Site P-K4 was discarded from the mean Fisher analysis on the basis of its clockwise rotation, being consistent with the rest of the upper Cretaceous sites, whilst sites P-K9 and P-K10 yielded unstable vector behaviors. The clockwise rotation of Site P-K4 can be simply the result of paleosecular variation. Directions of the ChRMs cluster well with the precision parameter increasing from k g = 10.6 to k s = 85.6 after tilt correction. The McElhinny (1964) fold test demonstrates an increase in precision parameter by a k -ratio of 5.8 at the 99% confidence level during progressive unfolding (critical values at 95% = 2.48; 99% = 3.7). The McFadden (1990) fold test indicated that magnetization was acquired at 96% unfolding. A positive reversal test (classification C) is also derived with γ obs = 3.6° < γ critic = 16.0° ( McFadden and McElhinny, 1990 ) from mixed polarities ( Table 2 , Fig. 9 ). Both the positive reversal test and the fold test suggest that ChRM in upper Cretaceous rocks is pre-folding, and probably primary, and that secondary overprints have been successfully removed by the cleaning treatment. The tilt-corrected mean direction from the Maastrichtian Akveren Formation, located near Samsun, was D s = 344.0°, I s = 40.0° ( k = 42.0, α 95 = 14.0°, N = 4 sites, Table 2 Fig. 9 b). Errors on declination and inclination are also given in Table 1 as Δ D x and Δ I x separately, following Butler (1992) . The McElhinny (1964) fold test shows a precision parameter increasing by a k-ratio of 3.7 at the 99% significance level during progressive unfolding (critical values at 95% = 4.28; 99% = 8.47) whilst the McFadden (1990) fold test showed a magnetization acquired at 127% unfolding. The tilt-corrected mean direction from the middle Eocene rocks in the Gümüşhane-Bayburt area is D s = 332.3°, I s = 49.9° ( k = 33.2, α 95 = 9.2°, N = 10 sites, Table 2 , Fig. 9 c). The ChRM directions of the middle Eocene sites are better grouped in stratigraphic coordinates with precision parameter of k g = 19.7 and k s = 31.6 before and after tilt correction, respectively. Components at sites P-E26 and P-E22 are excluded from the mean direction because they are far removed from directions at the other sites and may, therefore, be affected by local tectonic rotations due to faulting. Also, around Ispir two reliable mean directions with approximately 40° NE direction (P-E27 and 29) were not included in the Fisher analysis because of large and contrasting clockwise rotations; further, site P-E28, with α 95 greater than 30, must be considered insignificant ( Table 2 ). Mean paleomagnetic directions of six normal and four reverse polarities (Site P-E15 to P-E21 and P-E23 to P-E25) provide a positive reversal test with classification C ( γ obs = 15.5° < γ critic = 15.8° McFadden and McElhinny, 1990 ) and secondary overprints are considered to have been successfully removed. Because declinations show a larger scatter of rotation from NW to NE compared with inclination we applied the Fisher fold test analysis described by Enkin and Watson (1996) for inclination-only data to determine the timing of remanence magnetism. The maximum value of the precision, k , from this analysis is determined at 80% unfolding ( k max. = 40.16) for N = 14 sites. In geographic coordinates: Inc: 51.27 + 10.6 − 8.5, k = 15.7 and in stratigraphic coordinates: Inc: 50.5 ± 4.9, k = 37.3, suggesting that these middle Eocene directions from the EP are of a primary origin. 5 Discussion As reported in Table 2 and shown in Fig. 9 , the mean directions for the upper Cretaceous (Campanian and Maastrichtian) sites (P-K1 to P-K8, PK11 to P-K14) are well clustered within the α 95 confidence level below 15.0°, suggesting that these results yield coherent groupings suggesting that relative rotations between the sites are small. The upper Cretaceous mean directions from the EP were obtained from two different localities: one in the Trabzon-Hopa area ( Table 2 , Fig. 9 a), yielding a mean direction of D = 160.3°, I = -45.0° and a corresponding paleolatitude of 26.6 + 5.1 − 4.6 for Campanian age, and the other, showing a mean direction of D = 345.5°, I = 40.3° and a resulting paleolatitude of 22.8 + 11.7 − 9.1 , from Maastrichtian Akveren Formation near the Samsun-Kavak area ( Table 2 , Fig. 9 b). The mean inclination derived for the Akveren Formation shows a slightly lower degree than that for the Campanian volcanics. This might imply that the sediments have been affected by inclination error. However, in this case, the inclination flattening approach was not considered because the data set for testing the inclination error ( Tauxe and Kent, 2004 ) was not large enough to give a meaningful result. The α 95 confidence level from Maastrichtian sandstones is larger (14.0°) than that from the Campanian volcanic rocks (6.0°). This result also agrees with the Eurasian pole position of Besse and Courtillot (2002) between 80 and 70 Ma and the paleolatitude data obtained by Torsvik et al. (2008) ( Fig. 10 ). Previous paleomagnetic studies from upper Cretaceous rocks around the EP indicated a mean paleolatitude of 25.5 ± 4.5° ( Channell et al., 1996 ), whereas slightly lower paleolatitudes of 21.4 + 5.8 − 5.1 and 20.0 + 2.5 − 2.5 were obtained in the study of Van der Voo (1968) and Çinku et al. (2010) , respectively. The mean directions obtained from upper Cretaceous rocks in this study are compatible with the results of Channell et al. (1996) . In Fig. 10 , the late Cretaceous paleolatitudes determined in this study are compared as a function of time with Eurasian and Gondwana reference paleolatitude curves obtained by Torsvik et al. (2008) for a location in the EP (41°N, 41°E). The EP are not shown to have been positioned further south than Eurasia, by 5.6 ± 6.7° in Campanian and 8.7 ± 10.2° in Maastrichtian. Since the previous paleomagnetic studies of middle Eocene rocks indicated a relative low paleolatitude of 193 N ° − 3.9 + 4.3 and 22.8 N ° − 4.8 + 5.4 for the EP after Van der Voo (1968) and Kissel et al. (2003) , respectively, the middle Eocene mean paleolatitude obtained from volcanic rocks in this study is 31.8 N ° − 6.7 + 9.7 ( Table 2 , Fig. 10 ), compatible with the coeval reference paleolatitude of Eurasia after Besse and Courtillot (2002) . In order to make a comparison between the observed paleomagnetic rotations and fold belts in the Pontides, a database has been compiled based on this study and paleomagnetic data obtained from previous studies ( Vollstadt et al., 1967; Van der Voo, 1968; Pechersky and Nguyen, 1979; Orbay et al., 1983; Sarıbudak, 1989; Platzman et al., 1994; Channell et al., 1996; Piper et al., 1996 ) ( Table 3 ). The paleomagnetic pole positions of various groups are compared with the paleomagnetic poles from stable Eurasia of comparable age ( Besse and Courtillot, 2002 ), (81.4°N, 206.1°E with α 95 = 5.9°) using Enkin's (unpublished) PMGSC (version 4.2) software. The discrepancy between the observed poles ( λ obs , ϕ obs ) and reference poles ( λ ref , ϕ ref ) was computed following the pole-space method of Beck (1980) to define the amount of the vertical-axis rotation ( R ) and poleward transport ( p ). The confidence limits, Δ R and Δ F , are determined after Demarest (1983) . According to the relief map of the Pontides, a concave-downward shape lies between 35°N and 42°N latitudes in the Samsun and Hopa regions, whereas a concave-upward shaped curve is clearly apparent beginning from Hopa to LC between the latitudes of 42–49°N ( Fig. 1 ). A tectonic interpretation of the curvature of the fold belt would predict clockwise rotation between Samsun-Ordu and counterclockwise rotation between Ordu-Hopa. The rotations between Ordu-Hopa are compatible with the curvature of the fold belt. It appears to be in a counterclockwise manner as follows: R ± Δ R = 15.1 ± 7.7°, R ± Δ R = 9.9 ± 7.8°, and R ± Δ R = 8.4 ± 9.2° for groupings B2, B3, and B4, respectively ( Table 3 , Fig. 11 ). However, a rotation of R ± Δ R = 16.6 ± 14.7 °for group B1 which lies in the area between Samsun-Hopa could not be matched with the structural domains as a evidence of a oroclinal bending. Therefore it is concluded that the oroclinal bending in EP begins from Ordu ( Fig. 1 ). East of 44°E longitude, the paleomagnetic vectors change their direction and show significant clockwise rotations of R ± Δ R = 30.4 ± 7.9°, R ± Δ R = 26.0 ± 7.8°, and R ± Δ R = 29.6 ± 9.6° for groupings B5, B6, and B7, respectively ( Fig. 11 ). As a next step, in the case of the middle Eocene mean directions, the poleward transport and tectonic rotations were compared with the expected direction at 40 Ma from the APWP of Eurasia (78.8°N and 160.2°E, with α 95 = 7.3°; Besse and Courtillot, 2002 ). The computed tectonic rotations for the EP indicate a counterclockwise rotation ranging between 18.2 ± 11.0–25.5 ± 8.2 ( Table 4 ). A maximum rotation is obtained between Trabzon-Hopa ( Fig. 12 ), which then decreases towards Georgia indicating counterclockwise rotation of −14.6.5 ± 9.0 and finally attenuates in LC with a rotation of 3.3 ± 7.8. The distribution of these rotation patterns is typical evidence of a folding axis in this area. The possibility of oroclinal bending is tested by plotting the paleomagnetic declinations as a function of strike deviation ( Fig. 13 ). The paleomagnetic directions are used from Tables 1 and 2 and the corresponding strike axis of the both the upper Cretaceous and middle Eocene paleomagnetic directions are obtained from the geological maps. The theoretical regression line displays a slope of 45°, which is expected for an originally oroclinal bend. Declinations from Upper Cretaceous rocks in EP, west of the strike axis show a counterclockwise pattern whereas the declinations from ATB and LC east of the strike axis show a clockwise pattern ( Fig. 13 a). The linear regression analysis between the strikes and the declination of the tilt corrected sites yields a correlation coefficient of 0.88 that is deviating by 6° from the theoretical regression line. The site mean directions of P-K11,12,13 and 15° deviate significantly from the common mean direction and the paleomagnetic data are, therefore, not included into the regression analysis. Moreover, the oroclinal bending model is proposed for an area between Ordu and LC, whilst these paleomagnetic sites belongs to the western border of the EP ( Fig. 1 ). An interpetation in this area is suggested by Meijers et al. (2010) , who inferred an oroclinal bending in the central Pontides from Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene paleomagnetic data. The mechanism is thought to have been developed by convergence of the Pontides and the Taurides. A similar plot is illustrated for the middle Eocene data in Fig. 13 b, although the sites P-E18 and P-E22 ( Table 1 ) are not included because of large scatters in observed declination. In particular, low declination values obtained from site 17b and P-E21 ( Table 1 ) lead to a large scatter in the declination versus strike of folds plot. The paleomagnetic declinations from sites 1, 3 and 4 obtained from previous studies lie in the western border of the EP and show counterclockwise rotation which is incompatible with the shape of the oroclinal bending, therefore they are not included into the analysis ( Fig. 13 b). However, beginning with the area east of Ordu, the Middle Eocene paleomagnetic declinations fits well with the bending ( Fig. 1 ). A correlation coefficient of 0.72 is obtained from EP and LC sites, showing a regression line with a discrepancy of 8° to the theoretical regression line, which is almost parallel. In addition, to make a clearer discrimination, the whole upper Cretaceous and middle Eocene dataset is combined within the declination vs. strike plot ( Fig. 13 c). In this case, mean declination from sites PK11, 12, 13 and 14 in upper Cretaceous rocks and sites 1, 2, 3, 4 from middle Eocene rocks are excluded because for reason explained above. The linear regression analysis between the strikes and the declination of the tilt corrected sites yields a correlation coefficient of 0.72 that is deviating by 9° from the theoretical regression line. As a result, the linear dependence of both the upper Cretaceous and middle Eocene data clearly show the presence of an oroclinal bending, beginning from Ordu to the LC. The interpretation is consistent with the paleomagnetic data of Bazhenov and Burtman (2002) , supporting the oroclinal bending model in the LC. Based on numerous geological studies in the investigation area, it was accepted that the northwards subduction and the finally consumption of the northern branch of Neotethys ocean led to collision of the EP to the north with the Taurus Platform to the south during the Paleocene-Eocene ( Şengör and Yılmaz, 1981; Okay and Şahintürk, 1997; Okay and Tüysüz, 1999; Rangin et al., 2002; Boztug, 2009 ). The later collision which occurred between the Arabian platform and the Taurides during the Oligocene was marked by the stepwise consumption of the southern branch of the Neotethys ( Şengör and Yılmaz, 1981; Robertson and Dixon, 1984; Yılmaz, 1993; Robertson et al., 2007 ) ( Fig. 14 a ). The ongoing deformation during late Miocene-Pliocene times was dominated by strike-slip faulting, NE-SW and NW-SE directed thrusting during the compression episodes of Arabian platform with the Eurasian active margin, which resulted in intensive shortening with reference to oroclinal bending in EP as well in LC ( Fig. 14 b). According to GPS-derived velocity vectors ( McClusky et al., 2000 ) across Anatolia, the N–S shortening absorbed in front of the Arabia-Eurasia collision is less than 0.5 cm/year. Because both the Upper Cretaceous and the Middle Eocene paleomagnetic declinations in the EP show counterclockwise rotations, whereas the paleomagnetic declinations in LC lie in clockwise manner, it is likely that oroclinal bending began to occur after the emplacement of the middle Eocene volcanism, during a time, therefore, including the collision of the Anatolian and the Arabian plates. 6 Conclusions A paleomagnetic study of Upper Cretaceous rocks from the EP combined with other published paleomagnetic results demonstrates mean tectonic rotations of R ± Δ R = −12.9 ± 6.7°, and R ± Δ R = 29.2 ± 6.6° for the Eastern Pontides (EP) and the Lesser Caucasus (LC), respectively, with respect to Eurasia. The middle Eocene mean tectonic rotation for the EP is counterclockwise ranging between 18.2 ± 11.0 and 25.5 ± 8.2. In the LC a counterclockwise rotation of −14.6.5 ± 9.0 and a clockwise rotation of 3.3 ± 7.8 are reported. This study shows that the paleomagnetic declinations obtained from both the upper Cretaceous and Middle Eocene rocks in the EP are consistent with the shape of an oroclinal bending which runs from the Ordu in the EP to the LC. The shape of the oroclinal bending is interpreted to be the result of the collision of the Arabian block with Eurasia, which is concentrated at the southeastern border of the Eastern Black Sea Basin, as a response to counterclockwise rotations in the EP.

An outcrop along the Arroyo el Mimbral in northeastern Mexico contains a layered clastic unit up to 3 m thick that interrupts a biostratigraphically complete pelagic-marl sequence deposited at more than 400 m water depth. The marls were found to be unsuitable for determining magnetostratigraphy, but foraminiferal biostratigraphy places the clastic unit precisely at the K-T boundary. We interpret this clastic unit as the deposit of a megawave or tsunami produced by an extraterrestrial impact. The clastic unit comprises three main subunits. (1) The basal ""spherule bed"" contains glass in the form of tektites and microtektites, glass spherules replaced by chlorite-smectite and calcite, and quartz grains showing probable shock features. This bed is interpreted as a channelized deposit of proximal ejecta. (2) A set of lenticular, massive, graded ""laminated beds"" contains intraclasts and abundant plant debris, and may be the result of megawave backwash that carried coarse debris from shallow parts of the continental margin into deeper water. (3) At the top, several thin ""ripple beds"" composed of fine sand are separated by clay drapes; they are interpreted as deposits of oscillating currents, perhaps a seiche. An iridium anomaly (921 +/- 23 pg/g) is observed at the top of the ripple beds. Our observations at the Mimbral locality support the hypothesis of a K-T impact on nearby Yucatan.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/82/A9/69/82A9694D3A0873B40A72912986095FCC.pdf

Detailed sampling and analyses were performed along selected drillings, among which sedimentological, mineralogical, chemostratigraphic (δ13Corg), biostratigraphic and palynological data have been obtained. New Mbs/Fms are defined around the Paleocene-Eocene boundary (PEb) and compared to the lithostratigraphic nomenclatures of the Belgian and Paris Basins (Steurbaut, 1998; Aubry et al., 2005). Biostratigraphy based on the study of foraminifera and mammal fauna, palynological content and chemostratigraphy enable correlation to be established between adjacent basins as well as sea level and landscape evolutions to be refined during this critical interval. Upper Thanetian marine units In the AVE 007-drilling (Mormal Forest, Locquignol, between Englefontaine, Landrecies and Maroilles villages), the Coniacian chalk is overlain by a flint conglomerate, whose sandy-clayey matrix contains Thanetian pollen and dinocysts. Widespread in Avesnois and containing often reworked Upper Cretaceous foraminifera and occasionally glauconite, this unit constitutes the Vervins Mb (cf. 'Argile a silex de Vervins' interpreted as a marine conglomerate by Gosselet, 1879). It is often overlain by the Mondrepuis-Bettrechies Sand Mb (cf. 'Sable verts de l'Avesnois'), a thin sandy glauconiferous unit, more clayey and silty westward (cf. 'Tuffeau de Valenciennes' Mb). The three Mbs constitute the Hainaut-Valenciennois Fm and can be correlated to the Belgian Grandglise Mb (upper part of the Hannut Fm) and Bois-Gilles Fm, and to the Paris Basin Châlons-sur-Vesles and Bracheux Fms, all Thanetian in age. Uppermost Paleocene to lowermost Eocene terrestrial units In AVE 007 the Vervins Mb is unconformably overlain by flint gravels (Mormal Mb), then a pyritic sand (Le Quesnoy Sand Mb, cf. 'Sables et Gres du Quesnoy' of Gosselet, 1890), and a lignitic clay (Locquignol Mb), silty and ochreous at the top. All but the top ochreous paleosol contain spores and pollen grains and are devoid of dinocysts, they were thus probably deposited in terrestrial environments. The Carbon Isotope Excursion (CIE) of the PEb begins below the top of the sandy unit and continues in the lignitic clay. The palynological study confirms the Locquignol Mb's earliest Eocene age and allows correlation with the base of the Tienen Fm. To the East of AVE 007 along the Belgium-France border, fluvial fossiliferous gravels and sands have been studied in past sand quarries (Erquelinnes Sand Mb). Above a sharp unconformity, they i) overly Upper Thanetian marine sands (Bois-Gilles Fm, NP9a, then Grandglise Mb, NP8), ii) contain a mammal fauna referred as MP7 in the Mammalian biochronological scale for the European Paleogene (Missiaen et al., 2013) and iii) record the first part of the CIE onset in the basal fossiliferous gravel and marl beds. Three km west of Erquelinnes and toward AVE 007 a few drillings have recognized a sandy and pyritic unit containing resinite fragments, lignite and peat beds (Vieux Reng Mb), overlying a thin basal flint gravel bed (Mormal Mb). These five Mormal, Le Quesnoy, Locquignol, Vieux-Reng and Erquelinnes Sand Mbs form the Sambre Fm. Such fluvial gravels and sands, more or less lignitic, clayey or marly are widespread in northern France and southeastern Belgium. They belong to the so-called Upper Landenian and are correlated to the Tienen Fm. In AVE 007, they record the CIE onset marking the PEb and 2.5 m of Upper Paleocene fluvial units, in contrast with Belgian drillings such as Doel and Kallo where a hiatus is present at the PEb. Lower Ypresian hiatus and marine units In AVE 007, a laminated silty unit overlies the Locquignol Mb, contains dinocysts Wetzeliella sp. and agglutinated foraminifera similar to those of the base of the Orchies Clay Mb. Widespread in Avesnois-Valenciennois that marine unit is named Avesnois Mb, it is locally richer in very fine sand, and correlated to the base of the Kortrijk Clay Fm (Ieper Gp). In Avesnois, Sparnacian lagoonal units are absent upon the terrestrial ones described above, again marking a reverse trend when compared with the Belgian and adjacent Basins. This may result from restricted terrestrial environments coinciding with Variscan accidents and structural highs between the Artois anticline and Ardenne Masssif, or to their deposition followed by subsequent erosion prior to the Lower Ypresian marine transgression (cf. sea level drop 2 of Dupuis et al, 2011). Correlations and PETM impact on land All terrestrial units here described fill fluvial channels incised in marine Thanetian and older units such as the Cretaceous or the Variscan basement in Avesnois and Belgium, as already reported elsewhere in northern France (cf. sea level drop 1 of Dupuis et al., 2011). They exhibit locally cross stratification, lignite, flora or vertebrate fauna, for example at Leval, Hoegaarden and Dormaal, and/or are intensively silicified with scarce root or leaf casts. Similar fluvial sediments and silcretes are recognized in the first Sparnacian units and paleogeography of the Paris, Dieppe-Hampshire and London Basins, where the PEb is also present, the CIE being recorded on thicknesses between 3 m (as in AVE 007) to >20 m (as in Sinceny). These features may be regarded now as constant in those Sparnacian landscapes recording the PETM, with very rapid lateral and vertical facies shift, particular paleosols, a few fossiliferous fluvial to lacustrine units and variable deposition rates/sediments preservation. Terrestrial sediments, flora and fauna have been described there before the CIE onset as well, for example at Cobham, Vasterival or Rivecourt (e.g. Smith et al., 2014). Lihons, an intermediate outlier situated between AVE 007 and Sparnacian sites of those basins has further been investigated: marine Thanetian sands are overlain by thin fluvial, lacustrine then lagoonal sediments, the two latter recording the CIE of the PETM on an interval 4 m thick. Here again the basal terrestrial sediments have been deposited before the PEb. In AVE 007, depositional environments are fluvial for the Mormal and Le Quesnoy Mbs, and evolve toward flood plain then palustrine ones for the Locquignol Mb, probably here after the river bed migration, but still recording sporo-pollen fluvial inputs from the hinterland, the whole indicating a rather humid subtropical climate. Compared to the Locquignol Mb, the sporopollinic assemblage of the Mormal and Le Quesnoy Mbs (below the CIE onset) is different, particularly regarding the Normapolles distribution, the Tricolpates, Tricolporates and Monocolpates relative pollen abundances and the pollen ratio of Plicapollis pseudoexcelsus/Juglandaceae. In the three Mbs, rapid vertical variations characterize pollen and fern spores assemblages, with peaks of particular taxa reaching 25% of the total counts, such as for P. pseudoexcelsus, T. platycaryoides, C. dorogensis, P. mcgregorii, T. robustus. They suggest rapid floral changes in the catchment and/or sources changes in the surrounding landscapes compartments for the rivers supplying the fluvial sediments. Resinite particles are irregularly abundant as well as microcharcoals are occasionally abundant, notably slightly before the CIE onset and 1.5 m above it, still within the CIE. The clay mineral assemblage is homogeneous along marine Thanetian units and strongly dominated by Illite-Smectite (IS) mixed layers, whatever the facies, while it is more variable in the marine Ypresian silts (abundant IS, followed by Kaolinite, Illite, Chlorite and Vermiculite). In contrast terrestrial units are dominated by IS followed by Kaolinite, Illite and very rare Chlorite, and no variation is observed across the PEb. Those data would suggest that major environmental changes have regionally begun before the PETM, at the very end of the Paleocene, when terrestrial realm has settled, in relation with a regional uplift.

Collect, analyze and evaluate the ethnobotanical knowledge about medicinal plants in Northern Navarra (Iberian Peninsula) with 4243 km 2 and 71,069 inhabitants. Material and methods We performed semi-structured interviews with 253 informants (mean age 69; 61% women, 39% men) in 120 locations, identified the plant reported and analyzed the results, comparing them with those from other territories. Results The informants reported data on 174 medicinal plants belonging to 63 botanical families. This work is focused on human medicinal plant uses, which represent 98% of the pharmaceutical uses (1725 use reports). The species with the highest number of cites are Chamaemelum nobile , Sambucus nigra and Verbena officinalis , with a long tradition of use in The Mountain (Navarra). All different plant parts are used; aerial part is exploited more frequently than other plant parts. Most of the listed remedies use a single ingredient, typically soaked in water. Usually, the administration is primarily oral followed by topical applications. Conclusions The main ailments treated are digestive troubles, wounds and dermatological problems, and respiratory affections. Informants reported 24 new or scarcely cited uses for 23 medicinal plants. For 35% of the species (8) we have not found bibliographical references in the scientific literature and 48% (11) have only one to three references. Keywords Medicinal plants Traditional knowledge Ethnopharmacology The Mountain Navarra Spain 1 Introduction Navarra is a territory of 10,421 km 2 placed to the North of the Iberian Peninsula, and three zones can be differed: The Mountain on the North, The Riverside on the South, and both separated by a zone of transition, The Middle Navarra. The Mountain, which embraces 4243 km 2 , starting at Pyrenean foothills reaches altitudes of 2428 m.a.s.l., and tower over steep-sided valleys composed of flysch ( Gobierno de Navarra, 1997 ); the landscape then softens into a geomorphology based on marls and limestone marls. In the Southern part, the valleys are wider with least marked slopes. This area is divided into two agricultural regions ( Fig. 1 ): Northwest Navarra (Humid Cantabrian Valleys and Southern Humid Valleys, C1: 1921 km 2 ) and Valleys of the Pyrenees and pre-Pyrenean (C2: 2322 km 2 ). The bioclimate oceanic temperate, characterized by mild temperatures and high precipitation throughout the year, appears in the Northern part of the area ( López et al., 2005 ) Toward the South precipitations decrease, the bioclimate changes to the sub-Mediterranean variant, and finally, a small island of seasonal-rainfall Mediterranean bioclimate, characterized by seasonal drought (favouring species that are specifically Mediterranean), is present. The vegetation is obviously conditioned by this kind of bioclimate.The landscape is characterized by green fields (natural grasslands and cornfields meadows), beech forests ( Fagus sylvatica L.), different oak forests ( Quercus robur L., Quercus humilis L., Quercus faginea Lam., Quercus ilex L. and Quercus pyrenaica Willd), and their associated communities. The difference in altitude between Pyrenees and pre-Pyrenean Valleys also permits the emergence of different plant communities: black pine grove ( Pinus uncinata Miller ex Mirbel) and wild pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.), fir ( Abies alba Miller), Pyrenean pastures rich in Alpine and sub-Alpine plant series, among others ( Loidi and Báscones, 1995; Lorda, 2001 ). The population is around 71,069 inhabitants ( Instituto de Estadística de Navarra, 2008 ). In C1 region, with 56,218 inhabitants, the most populated areas are found in industrialized zones, while the least populated are where rural life is preserved. Due to the abrupt physical environment that has led to a lack of resources, and a rural exodus, C2 region is the least populated (14,851 inhabitants).Human populations are medium to small living in scattering isolated houses, the typical farmhouses (“Caserios”). The villages are usually located at the bottom of the main valleys and the farmhouses (“Caserios”) in the side valleys perching on the slopes ( Elósegui and Pérez, 1982 ). Navarra is officially divided in three linguistic areas, Basque-speaking zone, mixed zone and non Basque-speaking area ( Zabaleta, 1997 ). The studied region is included into the Basque-speaking and mixed zone. The culture of this region is determinates by all these mentioned factors. In the last decades, ethnobotanical studies among surviving rural populations in industrialized countries have received growing attention. Many ethnobotanical surveys have been carried out in different areas of the Iberian Peninsula, because a high biological and cultural diversity: Cataluña ( Bonet et al., 1992, 1999, 2001; Raja, 1995; Raja et al., 1997; Agelet, 1999; Agelet and Vallès, 1999, 2001, 2003a, 2003b; Agelet et al., 2000, 2002; Bonet, 2001; Bonet and Vallès, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007; Muntané, 2002, 2005; Parada et al., 2002; Rigat, 2005; Parada, 2007; Rigat et al., 2007 ); Extremadura ( Blanco et al., 2000 ); Lugo ( Blanco et al., 1999 ); Aragón ( Villar et al., 1984, 1992; Ferrández and Sanz, 1993; Palacín, 1996; Palacín et al., 1984a, 1984b ); Alentejo ( Camejo-Rodrigues, 2001 , Camejo-Rodrigues et al., 2003 ); Jaén ( Fernández-Ocaña, 2000; Espinosa et al., 2001a, 2001b; Casado, 2003 ); Córdoba ( Casana, 1993; Galán, 1993 ); Granada ( González-Tejero, 1989; González-Tejero et al., 1990, 1995; Benitez et al., 2010 ); Almería ( Martínez-Lirola et al., 1997; Torres, 2004 ); Castellón ( Mulet, 1991 ); Cantabria ( Pardo de Santayana, 2004 ); Montesinho ( Pinto, 2005 ); Asturias ( San Miguel, 2004 ); Badajoz ( Vázquez et al., 1997 ); Castilla and La Mancha ( Verde, 2002 ), mainly. In Navarra, despite the long tradition of biodiversity and ethnographic studies carried out, the ethnobotanical value has not received attention, except for some data recently published by Akerreta et al. (2007a,b, 2010) . To fill this gap, we analyzed the local traditional use (medicinal, veterinary, domestic and food purposes) of wild plants. Specifically, we aimed to compile an ethnobotanical inventory of both past and current uses, assuming that cultural and biological diversities are strongly interrelated and that people living in this area could still retain traditional uses disappeared elsewhere. In this frame, the main aims of the present paper are (i) to contribute to the diffusion of results from the study on The Mountain (Northern Navarra) to the scientific community, keeping in mind to open a door for researches on other disciplines and other works (ii) to do a quantitative assessment of the data obtained, comparing with similar studies in other territories, and (iii) to look for vascular plants which have not been previously cited or with scarce previous report on medicinal uses, that might be evaluated in further pharmacological studies. 2 Methodology 2.1 Field studies Field and laboratory work began on 2003 and lasted until September 2007. Information was collected using semi-structured ethnobotanical interviews as described by Martin ( Martin, 1995 ). Those interviews were always carried out spontaneously with people born or having lived most of their lives in the region studied. The informants’ search was realized across: (a) town halls; (b) geriatrics and pensioners’ clubs; (c) pharmacists of rural areas; (d) family, friends and contacts; and (e) spontaneous meeting in villages, gardens, fields and mountains ( Akerreta et al., 2010 ). A total of 253 informants were interviewed in 120 locations ( Fig. 1 ). Of those interviewed, 61% were women and 39% men. The ages of the interviewees ranged from 22 to 100 year, and mean age are 69 years. In the field work for each species the following data were noted: the local name, place, collection method, drying and preservation system, parts or organs used, method of preparation, dosage, and administration. Plant vouchers were collected, mostly in collaboration with the informants, and authenticated according to Flora Iberica ( Castroviejo et al., 1986–2005 ) and Flora of the Basque Country ( Aizpuru et al., 2003 ). These species were deposited in the PAMP Herbarium at the School of Science (University of Navarra). After all the information was compiled, a database in Microsoft Access ® was prepared to relate information concerning taxa and their uses, bibliographic references, and the interviewees. 2.2 Data analyses I/P index is calculated in order to know if the number of informants is suitable to the scientific validity of results obtained ( Muntané, 2005; Akerreta et al., 2010 ). The minimal number of surveys for a territory in Southern Europe is 0.10%. In this study, the population interviewed overcomes this minimum (0.36%). The accumulation or saturation curves ( Williams et al., 2005; Akerreta et al., 2010 ) compute randomised species accumulation and it demonstrates the differences in relative abundance as sample size. These curves show that the number of informants (253) is enough to confirm that the sample of interviewed population has a sufficient size (curves levelled between 100 and 150 informants). To confirm the degree of originality and novelty of the uses claimed by the informants, they are compared with those reported in more than 200 works on ethnobotany, economic botany, medicinal plants and phytotherapy, mainly. The plant uses not found in these papers or appearing only in a maximum of five of them, are considered as very scarcely reported. Quantitative ethnobotany calculations are performed, allowing us discussing the results and their novelty value comparing with other studies. The following indices are calculated: use values (UV) which is the ratio between the number of total uses and number of informants for each species ( Phillips and Gentry, 1993 ); number of medicinal plants/km 2 , per inhabitant and per informant; and finally the informant consensus factor (ICF), quotient between the number of use reports minus the number of used taxa and the number of use reports minus one ( Trotter and Logan, 1986 ), which indicates the degree of reliability of the uses claimed (higher when closer to 1). 3 Results and discussion A total of 1725 pharmaceutical uses are reported from the informants, 98% refer to human medicinal uses belonging to 174 plants (78% native and 22% introduced species from other continents, or other European regions). 17% of the introduced plants are cultivated in Navarra. The complete catalogue of the ethnoflora of the surveyed territory is given in Akerreta (2009) . 3.1 Botanical analyses: families, species and parts of the plants The 174 medicinal plants belong to 63 families, mainly represented by Compositae and Rosaceae (9%, each one), Labiatae (8%), Boraginaceae (4%) and Crassulaceae , Euphobiaceae , Liliaceae , Scrophulariaceae (3%, each one). These families are equally well represented throughout the Iberian Peninsula, and also constitute the major groups of medicinal plant in most of the works that are consulted ( Bonet et al., 1992, 1999; González-Tejero et al., 1995; Raja, 1995; Vázquez et al., 1997; Agelet, 1999; Fernández-Ocaña, 2000; Bonet, 2001; Pieroni et al., 2002, 2004; Novais et al., 2004; Guarrera et al., 2005, 2008; Macía et al., 2005; Scherrer et al., 2005; Akerreta et al., 2007b; De la Cruz et al., 2007; González-Tejero et al., 2007; Maxia et al., 2007; Rigat et al., 2007 ). These results can be due: (a) high species diversity, which changes according to the climate of each territory ( Bonet, 2001 ); (b) high ecological versatility, as well as its rapid adjustment to disturbed zones by the human activity ( Agelet, 1999; Stepp and Moerman, 2001; Aguilar-Støen and Moe, 2007 ). In addition, these plants adapted to disturbed habitats and in stress conditions, synthesize as defence mechanisms, active compounds for their ecological functions (dispersion of seeds, chemical defence against microbes, insects and herbivores, etc.); but also these compounds may have therapeutic interest ( Stepp and Moerman, 2001 ); (c) the best represented families in the flora of an area are the ones commonly used by local people ( Johns et al., 1990; Bonet et al., 1999 ). According to the number of given uses, Compositae (20%) and Rosaceae (10%) are the most represented family. However, families with only one to three taxa, are also very used, such as Verbenaceae ( Verbena officinalis , 8%), Caprifoliaceae ( Sambucus nigra ssp. nigra , 7%), and Urticaceae ( Urtica dioica , 7%). Other important families are Labiatae (6%), Liliaceae (6%) and Primulaceae (4%). ICF's high value (0.90) indicates the great uniformity in the use of some species to treat diseases. These data would be able to justify the low number of medicinal taxa used in Navarra; if certain plants are effective, there is not need to go looking for others ( Mesa-Jiménez, 1996; Heinrich et al., 1998 ). Table 1 shows a summary of the top 15 vascular plants with traditional phytotherapeutical use: they are the most reported species, the ones that also present a very high number of uses, high number of informants, its use values and a wide diversity range of medical uses. It is worth mentioning these plants, despite they are quite common and very often reported in ethnopharmacological papers, because they provide a good idea of the basic and more rooted ethnobotanical knowledge of the area studied; also, the most original medicinal plant uses in the region prospected, i.e. those not or scarcely previously reported, is presented in Table 2 . Following the reliability criteria of Le Grand and Wondergem (1987) and Johns et al. (1990) , in Tables 1 and 2 are listed the uses mentioned by at least three independent informants, as they constitute the most relevant ethnopharmacological data. The parts of the plant primarily used are the aerial part (51%) and the floral structures (23%) while the leaves (10%) and roots and bulb (8%), are also frequently used. Other parts used are fruits (7%), the whole plant (2%), and occasionally seeds (1%). These percentages are similarly found in other areas ( Agelet and Vallès, 1999; Bonet and Vallès, 2007; Benitez et al., 2010 ) and consistent with the data obtained for parts of plants used in veterinary medicine ( Akerreta et al., 2010 ). Generally, these parts facilitate plant identification and present less difficulties on collection and conservation methods. 3.2 Methods of drug preparation and administration Plants used in traditional remedies are prepared and administered in different forms. The percentage of internal and external uses is similar (54%, 45%, respectively). The plants are consumed fresh (56%), dry (30%) or indistinctly (12%). We detect that different forms of uses of some plants are forgotten (1%), and the same fact is noted about the way the plant is consumed (1% of the uses). For internal use, tisanes (infusions 72%, decoction 10%) are far followed by maceration with anisette (10%), direct administration or comestible (4%), and vapours (2%). The most important forms of preparation for external uses are poultices (36%), ointments (24%), and direct administration (19%); in lower proportion, “sahumerios” and olive oil or alcohol maceration. It is difficult to establish a quantitative formulation of remedies, because dosages are not always known (or only approximately given, almost never in units such as grams). 3.3 Main affections treated The most treated illnesses or troubles we group in 12 pathological groups. Other three groups are also considerate: “Various” in which the use-reports of unspecified diseases appear; “Magical” medicinal uses, and “Lost knowledge” ( Tables 1 and 2 ). We found 481 (28%) remedies to treat digestive problems (carminative, colic, diarrhoea, evil tripe, gastroenteritis, laxative, purgative, stomach ache, to the bloating and vomiting); 408 (24%) remedies to cure dermatological problems (“panizos”, furuncles, burn, skin ulcers and cracks, eczemas, warts, chilblains, skin spots, skin diseases, and wounds); 220 (13%) remedies to cardio-vascular conditions (hypertension, anti-inflammatory, heart problems, to purify or clean the blood, Anti-haemorrhoidal-piles-, for blood circulation); 211 (12%) remedies for respiratory tract infections (bronchitis, hoarseness, rhinitis, sore-throat, pulmonary paints, cold, and catarrh). Other remedies are mainly used to cure problems in the reproductive and urinary system, joints and rheumatism. Digestive and dermatologic problems are also the most cited in similar studies ( González-Tejero, 1989; Mulet, 1991; Heinrich et al., 1998; Bonet et al., 1999; Camejo-Rodrigues et al., 2003; Macía et al., 2005; Libman et al., 2006; Aburjai et al., 2007 ). Urtica dioica is one of the most mentioned plants ( Table 1 , 77 uses, 1.2 UV) for alterations of the circulatory system, joints and rheumatism, and as depurative. This plant is frequently referenced to confirm these uses ( Akerreta, 2009 ). On the other hand, attention should be focused on the use of plants popularly known as “manzanilla” (chamomile), which correctly refers to Chamaemelum nobile and Santolina chamaecyparissus ssp. squarrosa , plants generally used for gastrointestinal disorders. Both species belong to the Asteraceae family and have similar indications ( Table 1 ). Thus, Chamaemelum nobile is used in the West (which has the most humid climate, C1) and Santolina chamaecyparissus in the East (bordering the Central Pyrenees Region, a more Mediterranean climate, C2), because the species known as “manzanilla” varies from valley to valley. This fact is explained by the influence of the climate on the selection of plants. Both similar species, and with the same given use, may be inter-changeable, depending on the accessibility and availability, among other reasons. Popularly in Navarra there are some confusion between the stomach and the intestines, since everything in the abdomen is considered to be the same thing, including the abdominal viscera. As a result, stomach or intestinal pains, or even specific female pains (e.g., menstrual pain), have similar remedies ( Akerreta et al., 2007a,b ). Chamaemelum nobile is also one of the most cited plant, at the same time that Rosa canina and Tilia platiphyllos in ophthalmology and nervous system, respectively. In addition, there were 45 references mentioned maceration as a method of preparation with the fresh fruits of Prunus spinosa and Malus sylvestris . The most usual method is a maceration with anisette of the former species given as a result the liqueur called ‘patxaran’ and “patxaka” (internal and digestive use) respectively. Skin problems are very frequent in humid places ( Villar et al., 1992; Bonet et al., 1999; Agelet and Vallès, 2001 ). In this study many plants are used in cataplasms, direct applications and ointments: Allium cepa (30 uses), Sambucus nigra (29 uses), Verbena officinalis (26 uses), and Anagallis arvensis (19 uses). It is common and well-known the cataplasm of Verbena using as excipient the white of eggs, “the famous verbena omelette”. Moreover, this cataplasm is employed in respiratory and rheumatologic affections. Anagallis arvensis is the plant most mentioned in infectious diseases; its uses are reduced to the Basque area in Navarra, and the people interviewed refer to it for internal or external infections. On the other hand, Sambucus nigra is an important plant for two reasons: (a) it is one of the most employed in respiratory affections (tisanes, cataplasms, ointment and “sahumerios”); (b) its uses are lost (“Lost knowledge”), suggesting that this species is in process of disuse and oblivion. In a process of cultural erosion the use or indications for a given plant is the first information to be lost, whereas its vernacular name is the last to be forgotten ( Fernández-Ocaña, 2000 ). The aerial part of Parietaria judaica is employed in infusion and decoction as renal lithotripter. Its Basque common name ‘gibelbelarra’ (herb for liver), refers to its hepatic lithotripter function and to have other benefits associated with the hepatic function ( Bonet and Vallès, 2006 ). 3.4 Quantitative ethnobotany Quantitative data collection from ethnobotanical studies is turning to be essential for carrying out more solid comparisons between other ethnobotany works that use the same methodology ( Hoffman and Gallaher, 2007; Tardío and Pardo de Santayana, 2008 ). Table 3 shows some quantitative data on medicinal plants from 29 regions of the Iberian territories, including the three in the present study (Northern Navarra, C1 and C2). Comparison of index values reveals the ethnobotanical richness and reliability in every area, but differences in extension and number of inhabitants in every region gently vary these values and it should be considered. As assessed by other authors ( Begossi, 1996; Agelet, 1999 ), the number of medicinal plants reported by informants does not increase proportionally to the total number of people interviewed; new use citations become more infrequent as the number of informants rises. Similarly, the mean number of uses reported tends to stabilize as the number of informants increases ( Ali-Stayeh et al., 2000 ). In fact, the number of informants for this study (253) is the second highest in the areas compiled, and the number of medicinal plants reported (174) is among 553 taxa from Huesca ( Villar et al., 1992 ) and 92 taxa from Segarra ( Raja et al., 1997 ). The value of medicinal plants per informant (0.69), medicinal plants/km 2 (0.04) and per inhabitant (2.45 × 10 −3 ) is calculated as well ( Table 3 ). 3.5 New or scarcely reported medicinal plants Informants reported 24 scarcely cited plant uses for 23 species (13% of total) which are mentioned as medicinal for at least three independent informants. These plants are compiled in Table 2 , which includes, apart from plant nomenclature, plant activities as claimed by the informants, followed by the therapeutical category in brackets, and references. Moreover, their ways of preparation and administration are also referred. For 35% of the species (8) we have not found scientific references, and 48% (11) have only one to three references The “Magical” medicinal category is represented by 17 species with a total of 32 uses assigned. This includes, according to our interpretation, remedies not explained on the basis of pharmaceutical properties of the plant but rather on an intense faith in the fulfilment of its mission. In many cases, there are no ingestion of the plant or even topical contact. Many of these species are used in what we call “health rituals”, whether with religious or non-religious overtones. The use of medicinal plants in certain symbolic rites still occurs in the Northern of Navarra. People still place certain blessing species on the house doors, to protect them from illness. The two plants mainly employed are: (a) Carlina acanthifolia ssp. cynara , Basque common name “eguzkilore”, name related to the sun; (b) Tanacetum parthenium , the ritual is performed on the early morning of 24 June, San Juan's Night, before at dawn; for this reason, the common name of this plant is “San Juan Lorek”. In this type of magical or religious ritual, the use of Potentilla reptans as antihaemorrhoidal is often reported; the fresh plant is kept in a bag in the belief that when dries it cures the haemorrhoids. This has no scientific basis nowadays, but folklore continues to give equal importance to both conceptions of illness and remedy. Three interesting species are each one mentioned for postpartum treatments by two informants: Asplenium trichomanes ( Pieroni and Quave, 2005 ), Viscum album ( San Miguel, 2004 ) and Tanacetum parthenium ( Canales et al., 2005; Pinto, 2005; Bonet and Vallès, 2006 ). The scarcely references show that these plants could be interesting for future studies. 4 Concluding remarks The present study adds to the ethnobotanical map of Northern Navarra, a high number of species and medicinal uses. The pathologies treated by these plants are not serious, involving mainly the digestive, dermal and respiratory systems. The families that added the highest number of medicinal species to the ethnobotanical catalogue are Compositae and Rosaceae . We analyse the factors underlying the high use of plants from these two families. The species most referenciated are Chamaemelum nobile , Sambucus nigra and Verbena officinalis , with a long tradition of use in The Mountain (Navarra). Also, we confirm the high prevalence of medicinal rituals. The quantitative analysis provides indices that show the good knowledge of plants and uses in relation to their medicinal properties, as in other areas of Spain. Our work clearly shows that folk knowledge on medicinal plants and plant uses is still alive in the studied region. This fact draws attention to the need to preserve this wealth of local traditional medicine, and indicates that ethnobotanical studies constitute a valuable first step in the bioprospection process, which may lead to the development of new plant-based medicines. Our results also reveal the urgency of collecting ethnopharmacological data. Some of the traditional remedies are only known by the oldest people leading to the conclusion that the practice of the “natural” therapy is not popular or used in the preceding generations. Further studies on phytochemical and biological activity should also be conducted on the reported medicinal plants of this area so as to utilize them in drug development.

The piles were founded in chalk, and therefore detailed stratigraphical logging of the chalk strata was carried out using known marker bands such as flints bands and marl seams. This helped to develop a ground model, including the separation of the various chalk formations into their respective beds. Other investigation methods were employed to assist in developing the chalk stratigraphy, including downhole geophysical techniques, fluid temperature, fluid flow, resistivity, density, caliper and natural gamma. Other downhole tools, such as downhole optical imaging, were also used. Critical to the design of the pile was understanding the behaviour of the bentonite support fluid when used in chalk. Owing to concerns regarding the possible interaction of the bentonite with the chalk, bespoke laboratory tests were carried out on core samples using two commonly used bentonite types. The tests were carried out at two bentonite concentrations with chalk samples from three depths. Control samples were also tested without chalk. This paper presents the detailed investigation of the chalk and its interaction with the bentonite carried out prior to the commencement of the pile design.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/4C/33/A1/4C33A1A80DF65E56FF0F0EED1217ED6B.pdf

The foliage is clustered toward the tips of the branches and is thick, fleshy, and a glossy, medium green color. The insignificant half flowers are 3/4 to 1 inch in length, five to six lobed, and found in small clusters among the foliage. The fruits are black, glossy, smooth, and fairly prominent among the foliage. Inkberry provides food and cover for wildlife. Inkberry can be used as a seaside ornamental, specimen, or ground cover. They grow nearly to the high tide mark on the oceanside of the dunes among the Sea Oats and other highly salt tolerant plants. They are most effective when massed together as a low ground cover or low shrub. They catch sand and help stabilize the dunes. Inkberry is not harmed by salt spray and is found on sand dunes in southern Florida and the Florida Keys. It is drought tolerant, grows in alkaline and sandy soils, and requires full sun. Plantings inland should be located in a well-drained landscape setting. Beach Naupaka grows into a rounded to spreading shrub is a fast grower that is commonly 3 to 10 feet tall with an equal spread. They form a rounded clump where they have been planted along the beaches of South Florida. It has fleshy, bright green leaves that are densely clustered at the tips of the branches. The inconspicuous fragrant white half-moon flowers are borne in clusters of 5 to 9 and occur throughout the year. The fruits are white, pithy berries that are eaten by pigeons and seabirds, and then dispersed to new locations. Beach Naupaka is displacing rare native Florida Keys beach plants, such as Inkberry and Sea Lavender because it is widely sold and used as screen or hedge and as a tall ground cover along the beach. Beach Napuka will adapt to any soil and responds to irrigation and occasional fertilization with rapid growth. However, it also thrives on neglect. This shrub flourishes with high levels of sunshine and ocean spray, and it will grow well on marl land or on beach dunes. When planting your landscape, learn more about Florida Keys native",,

The section studied is composed of the Sub-Grybow Beds, the Grybow Marl Formation (GMF), and the Cergowa Beds, representing the middle to upper part of the Oligocene succession. The rocks studied consist of quartz, calcite, Na-plagioclase, muscovite and clay minerals (illite-smectite with 25-30% of smectite and kaolinite). Additionally, hematite occurs in the GMF and chlorite in the Cergowa Beds, respectively. The macerals assemblage of the GMF is dominated by landplant-derived compounds of liptinite, associated with minor amounts of vitrinite representing type II kerogen. The total organic carbon (TOC) content is between 0.45 and 6.16 wt.%. The delta C-13(org) values of the GMF vary between -27.1 and -27.9 parts per thousand. The values of both carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios of carbonates range for delta C-13 from -1.1 to -4.3 parts per thousand VPDB, and for O from -1.5 to -4.8 parts per thousand VPDB. The concentrations of Co, U, Ni, As, and Mo are higher in the GMF than in the adjacent strata and positively correlate with TOC and S. Values of the TOC/S and V/V+Ni ratios are 0.7 to 3.5 and 0.67 to 0.78, respectively, and indicate anoxic conditions. The ratios of U/Th and V/Cr (0.3-2.2, 1.18-3.18, respectively) suggest the change of oxic conditions to reducing conditions occurred during the GMF deposition. This change could have been preceded by a plankton bloom, initiated by a nutrient-rich freshwater inflow that is inferred from the decrease of the delta C-13(carb) values and the terrestrial detritus supply. Thermal alteration of the Grybow Succession is concluded on the basis of smectite illitisation and low delta O-18 values.",,

Parallel varve counting in four cores taken from the deep central part of the lake have led to the development of an independent varve chronology which may be compared with results of radiocarbon dating. Comparison of measured C-14 activities in carbonate fractions of lake marl with varve ages allow for the accurate estimation of secular changes of the C-14 dilution factor of total dissolved inorganic carbon. Using the geochemical model developed by Broecker and Walton (1959) and reconstructed changes of C-14 dilution it has been possible to reconstruct mean lake level during the Lateglacial and Holocene. The results of model calculations are compared with an independent record of lake level changes deduced from C-14 dated lithological boundaries marking low and high lake stands in numerous cores taken along lake shores, as well as with lake level data available from southern Sweden and France. Obtained patterns of lake level fluctuations show remarkable similarities with behaviour of Swedish lakes and general agreement with available records from European lakes. The behaviour of Gosciaz Lake during the last 12 ka BP reflects global climatic changes fairly well.",,

The lack of diurnal variations in both the rate of CH4 emission and its stable carbon isotopic composition suggests that CH4 flux from Cladium was independent of stomatal aperture and that gases were transported through the plant mainly via passive diffusion and/or effusion as opposed to active pressurized ventilation. Rhizospheric CH4 oxidation did not cause C-13-enriched CH4 to be emitted to the atmosphere by Cladium jamaicense. Previous workers have shown that Everglades soil types differ in that CH4 oxidizing bacteria are active in peat soils and inactive in marl soils (King et al., 1990; Gerard, 1992), however a comparison of the stable isotopic composition of emitted and sedimentary CH4 from Cladium marshes within marl and peat soils provided no evidence that rhizospheric CH4 oxidizing bacteria were consuming significant quantities of CH4 in situ within peat soils. Either CH4 oxidation in the rhizosphere was insignificant due to O2 limitation or it occurred quantitatively in discrete zones within the sediment, thereby imparting no isotopic signal to sedimentary CH4. Linear relationships between CH4 flux and live aboveground Cladium biomass in marl and peat soils were identical and offered no evidence for rhizospheric CH4 oxidation in peat soils. In Contrast core incubation experiments indicated that CH4 oxidizing bacteria at the sediment-water interface in peat soils intercepted and oxidized from 41 to 93 % (avg = 71 +/- 20 %, n = 9) of the CH4 diffusing from the sediments toward the overlying flood water. Furthermore, we were able to detect sediment-water interface oxidation with stable isotopes as CH4 emitted from the flood water (deltaC-13 = 57.3 +/- 3.6 parts per thousand, n = 5) after plants were clipped below the water surface was enriched in C-13 by over 10 parts per thousand relative to CH4 emitted from vegetated plots (deltaC-13 = -68.1 +/- 2.5 parts per thousand n = 10). Methane within flood water (before clipping) at peat sites was also C-13 enriched (deltaC-13 = -57.6 +/- 4.3 parts per thousand, n = 7). Lowering of the water table below the sediment surface caused an Everglades sawgrass marsh to shift from CH4 emission to the consumption of atmospheric CH4 at a rate of 55 +/- 41 mumol m-2d-1.",,

With the initial phase of drowning (incipient drowning), green algae, serpulid and whiteinellid facies (Lower Bahloul Formation) were deposited in the euphotic zone. Complete drowning during the early Turonian (Upper Bahloul Formation and Annaba Member) caused the benthic fauna and flora to become scarce, and the plankton (calcisphaerulids, foraminifera) and ammonites to proliferate, accompanied by the deposition of laminated pelagic micrites. Further, the reduction of carbonate sedimentation led to the deposition of pelagic marls. This phase was responsible for a worldwide oceanic anoxic event. Platform infilling during the middle Turonian (Bireno Member), contemporaneous with a major sea-level lowstand, engendered very shallow carbonate environments favourable to benthic biota and oolites. A second phase of drowning in the late Turonian (Aleg Formation) brought the platform floor below the euphotic zone, allowing the deposition of pelagic micrites and smectites. Final infilling of this platform during the early Coniacian (Douleb Member) favoured the development of rudist barrier-reef complexes which persisted for the duration of the Coniacian. In terms of sequence stratigraphy, the Turonian series indicate two depositional sequences. Drowning phases correspond to a transgressive systems tract, maximum-flooding surface and early highstand, whereas infilling phases include the late highstand and the lowstand systems tract of each sequence.

The sedimentology, stratigraphic architecture, and diagenetic alterations of deep marine sandstones of the Miocene Nutaysh Member of the Burqan Formation in the Midyan area (Saudi Arabia) are described based on number of measured sedimentologic sections, lithofacies identification in the field and laboratory studies. Three lithofacies types are here identified in the measured sections. These are from bottom to top: (1) ""lithofacies A"" consisting of massive to thickly-bedded, coarse-to-very coarse-grained sandstone and conglomerates; (2) ""lithofacies B"" consisting of well-bedded, coarse-to-medium-grained, well-sorted sandstone, and (3) ""lithofacies C"" consisting of thin-bedded, fine to very fine-grained, current-rippled sandstone, bioturbated shaley siltstone and marl. The main diagenetic processes in the sandstones include the formation of grain-coating smectite and rhombic dolomite. Small amounts of cements include the formation of authigenic kaolinite and calcite. The reservoir quality is anticipated to have been preserved under the transformation of smectite to deep burial illite, which is believed to prevent formation of quartz cements.",,

Whalen', 'org': 'Geological Survey of Canada', 'orgs': ['Geological Survey of Canada']}]","We examined the temporal and spatial relations of rock units within the Western Cordillera of Peru where two Cretaceous basins, the Huarmey-Canete and the West Peruvian Trough, were considered by previous workers to represent western and eastern parts respectively of the same marginal basin. The Huarmey-Canete Trough, which sits on Mesoproterozoic basement of the Arequipa block, was filled with up to 9 km of Tithonian to Albian tholeiitic–calc-alkaline volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks. It shoaled to subaerial eastward. At 105–101 Ma the rocks were tightly folded and intruded during and just after the deformation by a suite of 103 ± 2 Ma mafic intrusions, and later in the interval 94–82 Ma by probable subduction-related plutons of the Coastal batholith. The West Peruvian Trough, which sits on Paleozoic metamorphic basement, comprised a west-facing siliciclastic-carbonate platform and adjacent basin filled with up to 5 km of sandstone, shale, marl and thinly bedded limestone deposited continuously throughout the Cretaceous. Rocks of the West Peruvian Trough were detached from their basement, folded and thrust eastward during the Late Cretaceous–Early Tertiary. Because the facies and facing directions of the two basins are incompatible, and their development and subjacent basements also distinct, the two basins could not have developed adjacent to one another. Based on thickness, composition and magmatic style, we interpret the magmatism of the Huarmey-Canete Trough to represent a magmatic arc that shut down at about 105 Ma when the arc collided with an unknown terrane. We relate subsequent magmatism of the early 103 ± 2 Ma syntectonic mafic intrusions and dyke swarms to slab failure. The Huarmey-Canete-Coastal batholithic block and its Mesoproterozoic basement remained offshore until 77 ± 5 Ma when it collided with, and was emplaced upon, the partially subducted western margin of South America to form the east-vergent Maranon fold–thrust belt. A major pulse of 73–62 Ma plutonism and dyke emplacement followed terminal collision and is interpreted to have been related to slab failure of the west-dipping South American lithosphere. Magmatism, 53 Ma and younger, followed terminal collision and was generated by eastward subduction of Pacific oceanic lithosphere beneath South America. Similar spatial and temporal relations exist over the length of both Americas and represent the terminal collision of an arc-bearing ribbon continent with the Americas during the Late Cretaceous–Early Tertiary Laramide event. It thus separated long-standing westward subduction from the younger period of eastward subduction characteristic of today. We speculate that the Cordilleran Ribbon Continent formed during the Mesozoic over a major zone of downwelling between Tuzo and Jason along the boundary of Panthalassic and Pacific oceanic plates.SOMMAIRENous avons etudie les relations spatiales et temporales des unites de roches dans la portion ouest de la Cordillere du Perou, ou deux bassins cretaces, la fosse d’accumulation de Huarmey-Canete et la fosse d’accumulation peruvienne de l’ouest, ont ete percues par des auteurs precedents comme les portions ouest et est d’un meme bassin de marge. La fosse de Huarmey-Canete, qui repose sur le socle mesoproterozoique du bloc d’Arequipa, a ete comblee par des couches de roches volcaniques tholeitiques – calco-alcalines de l’Albien au Thithonien atteignant 9 km d’epaisseur. Vers l’est, l’ensemble a fini par former des hauts fonds. Vers 105 a 101 Ma, les roches ont ete plissees fortement puis recoupees par une suite d’intrusions vers 103 ± 2 Ma, durant et juste apres la deformation, et plus tard dans l’intervalle 94 – 82 Ma, probablement par des plutons de subduction du batholite cotier. Quant a la fosse d’accumulation peruvienne de l’ouest, elle repose sur un socle metamorphique paleozoique, et elle est constituee d’une plateforme silicoclastique – carbonate a pente ouest et d’un bassin contigu comble par des gres, des schistes, des marnes et des calcaires finement lamines atteignant 5 km d’epaisseur et qui se sont deposes en continu durant tout le Cretace. Les roches de la fosse d’accumulation peruvienne de l’ouest ont ete decollees de leur socle, plissees et charriees vers l’est durant la fin du Cretace et le debut du Tertiaire. Parce que les facies et les profondeurs de sedimentation de ces deux fosses d’accumulation dont incompatibles, et que leur developpement et leur socle sont differents, ces deux fosses ne peuvent pas s’etre developpees cote a cote. A cause de l’epaisseur accumulee, de sa composition et du style de son magmatisme, nous pensons que la fosse d’accumulation de Huarmey-Canete represente un arc magmatique qui s’est eteinte vers 105 Ma, lorsque l’arc est entre en collision avec un terrane inconnu. Nous pensons que le magmatisme subsequent aux premieres intrusions mafiques syntectoniques et aux reseaux de dykes de 103 ± 2 Ma sont a mettre au compte d’une rupture de plaque. Le bloc Huarmey-Canete-batholitique cotier et son socle mesoproterozoique sont demeures au large jusqu’a 77 ± 5 Ma, moment ou il est entre en collision et a ete pousse par-dessus la marge ouest sud-americaine partiellement subduite, pour ainsi former la zone de chevauchement de vergence est de Maranon. Nous croyons que la sequence majeure de plutonisme et d’intrusion de dykes qui a succede a la collision finale a 73–62 Ma doit etre reliee a une rupture de la plaque lithospherique sud-americaine a pendage ouest. Le magmatisme de 53 Ma et plus recent qui a succede a la collision finale, a ete genere par la subduction vers l’est de la lithosphere oceanique du Pacifique sous l’Amerique du Sud. Des relations temporelles et spatiales similaires qui existent tout le long des deux Ameriques representent la collision terminale d’un ruban continental d’arcs avec les Ameriques durant la phase tectonique laramienne de la fin du Cretace–debut du Tertiaire. Elle a donc separe la subduction vers l’ouest de longue date de la periode de subduction vers l’est plus jeune caracterisant la situation actuelle. Nous considerons que le ruban continental de la Cordillere s’est constitue durant le Mesozoique au-dessus d’une zone majeure de convection descendante entre Tuzo et Jason, le long de la limite entre les plaques oceaniques Panthalassique et Pacifique.",,

Nineteen sinkholes have formed in the last 33 years (1977–2009) as a result of the collapse of cavity roofs in the Neogene lacustrine limestone in the Obruk Plateau and beneath Quaternary lake sediments in the Karapınar-Hotamış Plain. Of these, 13 have formed within the past 4 years (2006–2009). The Obruk Plateau takes its name from the presence of several hundred paleo-sinkholes which formed as a result of natural processes during the Quaternary period. More recently, human activity has induced the formation of new sinkholes, which presents a hazard to life and property. Changing agricultural patterns have led to the opening of thousands of deep wells in recent years, and increased water pumping currently exceeds the sustainable yield of the aquifer. Thus the formation of sinkholes has been triggered by a combination of natural and human causes. The groundwater level has dropped almost 24 m in the vicinity of Karapınar during the last 26 years (1983–2008). Approximately 8 m of this drop occurred within the 4 years prior to the study (2005–2008). Legally-binding precautions must be taken to prevent further water table decline, in order to decrease sinkhole formation within the basin in the years to come. Keywords Karst Sinkhole Karst hazard Obruk Plateau Turkey 1 Introduction Carbonate karst is estimated to cover over 10–15% of the Earth’s land surface and these karstic terrains provide essential ground water to supply roughly 20–25% of the global population ( Ford and Williams, 2007 ). Within these karst areas, sinkholes are among the most significant natural hazards threatening human life and property and lead to increasing expenditure each year ( White, 1988; Waltham, 1989; Waltham and Fookes, 2003; Waltham et al., 2005; Parise et al., 2008 ). The location and timing of sinkholes cannot generally be predicted and they usually occur abruptly ( Newton, 1987; Waltham et al., 2005 ). Sinkhole hazards increase in cohesive alluvial cover on karst rocks ( Doğan and Çiçek, 2002; Waltham et al., 2005 ) and on evaporite karst, where dissolution is more rapid ( Benito et al., 1995; Alberto et al., 2008; Gutiérrez et al., 2008a,b; Luzón et al., 2008; Galve et al., 2009 ) in comparison to carbonate karst ( Bruno et al., 2008; Brinkmann et al., 2008 ) or caprock areas ( Doğan, 2005 ). In Turkey, nearly one third of which is composed of karst terrains, most attention is focused on sinkholes formed in recent years on lacustrine limestone and consolidated non-karst caprocks overlying the limestones near Karapınar in the Konya Closed Basin (KCB) ( Fig. 1 ), rather than on sinkhole hazards in evaporite karst, which are seen across a large area ( Doğan and Yeşilyurt, 2004; Doğan and Özel, 2005 ). The KCB is comprised of the Konya Plain sub-basin in the south, the Tuz Lake sub-basins in the north and the Obruk Plateau, which is located between these two sub-basins ( Fig. 1 ). Obruk is the local name for sinkholes that may be of collapse or caprock type; there are many that have been formed within the Taurus karst and in the KCB, and reach their greatest density on Obruk Plateau, northwest of Karapınar. In the Obruk Plateau, there are several hundreds of saucepan-like and cylindrical sinkholes, showing dimensions ranging from a few meters to tens of meters in width. Those which attract attention are “cenote” type ( Ford and Williams, 2007 ) sinkholes at diameters of several hundred meters; depths can range from 10 m to more than 100 m. A lake is often observed at the bottom where the sinkhole reaches the depth of the water table (e.g. Kızören, Çıralı, Meyil, Timraş, Apa) ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). Many geomorphologic and hydrologic studies have been conducted on the subject of the KCB especially regarding the Obruk Plateau sinkholes, which have attracted the attention of researchers since the early 20th century (e.g. Erinç, 1960; Eroskay and Günay, 1980; Canik and Çörekçioğlu, 1986; Erol, 1986, 1990; Biricik, 1992; Bayarı et al., 2009a,b ). However, the hazard to life and property posed by sinkholes, which continue to form rapidly at the present time, and which will continue to form in the future, has been widely ignored. The purpose of the present study is to determine the role of human and natural causes relating to the formation of new sinkholes around Karapınar. 2 Regional setting 2.1 Geological setting The formation and spatial distribution of sinkholes are closely related to the lacustrine İnsuyu Formation ( Ulu, 2009a,b ) and the aquifer in this formation ( Figs. 3 and 4 ). The İnsuyu Formation was formed as a result of an extension regime during The Upper Miocene–Pliocene ( Koçyiğit, 2005 ). It consists of thick limestone in the upper section, limestone, marl, clay, tuff and silt intercalation in the lower section ( Ulu, 2009a,b ). The thickness of fractured lacustrine limestone, suitable for karstification has been documented by boreholes to be over 200 m ( Canik and Çörekçioğlu, 1986 ). Limestone, marl and clay intercalations are commonly observed in the boreholes in the Obruk Plateau ( Fig. 5 ). At the base of the İnsuyu Formation, there is the Upper Cretaceous Karaböğürtlen Formation consisting of calciturbitide, quartzite, calcschist, serpentine, dunite, gabbro, shale and marble ( Ulu, 2009a,b ). The Karaböğürtlen Formation overlies Mesozoic formations. These Mesozoic formations consist of limestone, dolomite, marble and shale which are exposed in the study area ( Figs. 3 and 4 ). Volcanic mountains and maars formed as a result of Miocene-Quaternary volcanism ( Keller, 1974; Ulu, 2009a,b ) are common in the vicinity of Karapınar. These include Üzecek Mountain in the south of Obruk Plateau and Karacadağ, Meke Maar and Acı Lake Maar in the east. Sedimentation in the İnsuyu Formation came to end with the last compression that caused sediments deformation. Subsequently, Konya Graben – one of the biggest neotectonic structures characterizing continental extension in the West-Central Anatolia – were formed ( Koçyiğit, 2005 ). The modern Konya Graben is a large depression lying between Konya to the west, Niğde to the east, Karapınar to the north and Karaman to the south ( Fig. 1 ). It formed through an extension regime which began in the Late Pliocene. The western side of the Karapınar Graben, forming a part of Konya Graben, is bordered by the Seyithacı Fault, extending in a NE–SW direction ( Koçyiğit, 2005 ) ( Fig. 4 ). Thick Quaternary sediments largely were formed during glacial periods by the Paleo-Konya Lake and Tuz Lake. The Plaeo-Konya Lake approximately covered the areas where the Konya Plain is now situated and Tuz Lake, which covered a much larger area than it does now ( Erol, 1971; Fontugne et al., 1999; Kashima, 2002 ) ( Fig. 1 ). Borehole data indicate that the Quaternary sediments are 30–40 m thick near the edges of Karapınar-Hotamış Plain, increasing to be more than 100 m thick in the central areas of the plain ( Fig. 5 ), in accordance with tectonic subsidence. The Karapınar-Hotamış Plain is one of the sub-sections of the Konya Plain. The İnsuyu Formation remains high between the Quaternary sediments in the south and north because of the above-mentioned tectonic movement. 2.2 Hydrologic and hydrogeologic setting The large KCB has a semi-arid climate. Most streams in the region are seasonal, largely originate within the Central Taurus Mountains to the south, and terminate in the Konya Plain. The Obruk Plateau is largely devoid of runoff due to low precipitation, high evaporation and percolation. Considering that average precipitation in the basin is ∼330 mm (Konya 322.2 mm, Karaman 333.3 mm and Aksaray 347.3 mm) and average evapotranspiration is around ∼1300 mm (Konya 1305 mm, Karaman 1198 mm, Aksaray 1370 mm), it is clear that the Central Taurus Mountains are very important for the KCB. It has been known for many years that groundwater in the İnsuyu Formation aquifer flows from the high Central Taurus Mountains (2000–2500 m), the main recharge point in the south, towards Tuz Lake (∼905 m) ( Fig. 1 ), the main discharge point in the north ( Eroskay and Günay, 1980; Canik and Çörekçioğlu, 1986; Erol, 1986, 1990; Bayarı et al., 2009a,b ). This is also confirmed by the groundwater contours around Karapınar in the periods 1968–2008 ( Fig. 4 ). Radiocarbon dating determined that the age of the groundwater in the basin varies between the present-day and 40 ka years; water flows at 3 m/year within the aquifer, and increases in age from the main recharge point to the main discharge point ( Bayarı et al., 2009a ). According to Bayarı et al. (2009b) , there are two main, largely independent, aquifers within the KCB, which are separated by a Paleogene aquitard. The lower aquifer consists of Paleozoic–Mesozoic rocks. The upper aquifer is part of the İnsuyu Formation, in which limestone controls the formation and the areal distribution of sinkholes. The İnsuyu Formation aquifer contains Ca–HCO 3 groundwater, and 10–70 lt/s water could be pumped from deep wells of 50–250 m depth opened to this aquifer ( Bayarı et al., 2009b ). In recent years, a significant decline has occurred in the water table throughout the KCB because of increasing aridity and excessive pumping from deep wells. According to official data, 70% of nearly 100,000 deep wells are illegal ( İşçioğlu, 2008 ), and are bored in order to grow commercial crops which are highly water demanding ( Göçmez et al., 2008a; Bayarı et al., 2009a,b ). Approximately 886 M m 3 /year of water is pumped from the aquifer in the KCB. It is estimated that this exceeds the sustainable capacity of the aquifer by 267 M m 3 /year ( Göçmez et al., 2008a ). Comparison of the 1968 and 2008 groundwater contours shows that water table declined about 24 m in the last 41 years. In fact, long-term data for groundwater level obtained from wells show that, this water table decline occurred over a much shorter time ( Fig. 6 ). The series of groundwater measurements covering the longest period (1969–2008) was taken in the Gülfet Yayla well (well No. 52258 or 220), located approximately 10 km to the west of Karapınar at the border of Obruk Plateau ( Fig. 4 ). According to this data, no significant change occurred in ground water level between 1969 and 1982, with the exception of minor climatic fluctuations of a few meters (4 m maximum). However, from 1983 onwards, a decline trend started to be seen in the water table, which level −17.4 m in 1983 dropped to −41.1 m in 2008 ( Fig. 6 A). This lowering trend accelerated in 1990 (October −20.1 m) and 1999 (October −26.5 m). The most rapid decline in the water table occurred between 2005 and 2008, when the water table fell about 8 m (−33.1 m to −41.1 m). This period coincided with the formation of many sinkholes. The data set obtained from the Eğilmez well (well No. 52268) in the Hotamış Plain, in the southeast part of the study area ( Fig. 4 ) indicates that the water table fell 22.5 m during the 35 years between 1974 and 2008 ( Fig. 6 B). As in the Gülfet Yayla well, the measurements from this well also indicate a declining trend in the water table from 1983 onwards. The only well within the Obruk Plateau for which long term (between 1996 and 2008) measurements were taken is the Yenikent well (well No. 38306), located 1046 m to the west of Meyil sinkhole ( Fig. 4 ). The water table depth fell from −67 m in October 1996 to −82.6 m by July 2008. The recent dry period which has been influential in the region since 1980, has also contributed to the drop in groundwater level throughout the basin. Göçmez et al. (2008b) determined that 60% of the change in groundwater level in the KCB and 40% of the change in groundwater around Karapınar has resulted from climatic variables; the remaining change was caused by excessive water pumping. The years 1983, 1990 and 1999, when a subsidence trend was observed in the water table, coincided with the extension of irrigated farming, a period of climatic drought, and the introduction of agricultural crops with greater water requirements. The water table levels in Gülfet Yayla and Eğilmez wells started to show increased seasonal fluctuations, particularly from 1990 onwards. These fluctuations have increased over time, and are related to excessive water extraction from the aquifer for agricultural purposes. This process caused the groundwater level in the basin to drop. Accordingly, many shallow lakes, marshes and other water sources have dried up and the level of Tuz Lake has gone down. 2.3 Geomorphologic setting The Obruk Plateau is an extensive area (approximately 90 km E–W and 80 km N–S), which is 40–100 m higher than the Tuz Lake sub-basin in the north and the Konya Plain sub-basin in the south. The neotectonic regime, which is influential in the region, had a great influence on the southern and southeastern morphologic outline of the Obruk Plateau ( Koçyiğit, 2005 ). While the İnsuyu Formation is covered with thick Quaternary sediments of Konya Graben, which has started to subside under the influence of the extension regime in the south of the plateau, it has remained relatively high in the Obruk Plateau. The Tuz Lake sub-basin constitutes the lowest area of the Konya Basin topographically. For that reason, groundwater flows from the Konya Plain (∼1000 m) towards Tuz Lake (∼905 m). Pluvial lakes covering hundreds of square kilometers and reaching depths of several tens of meters emerged in the Konya Plain sub-basin during glacial periods and then largely or entirely disappeared during warm periods ( Erol, 1986, 1990 ). During the Last Glacial Maximum, the present Konya Plain was covered by the Paleo-Konya Lake. The Paleo-Konya Lake reached its most recent highest level between 23 and 17 14 C ka BP ( Roberts et al., 1979 ). The lake covered an area of more than 4000 km 2 , and was more than 20 m deep ( Fontugne et al., 1999; Karabıyıkoğlu et al., 1999 ). The same process affected the Tuz Lake sub-basin ( Erol, 1971; Kashima, 2002 ). Climate cycles during the Quaternary led to high amplitude water table fluctuations in the Obruk Plateau because of the emergence and disappearance of lakes in the KCB. According to Erol (1986, 1990) caves at different levels must have been formed in the İnsuyu Formation limestone in the Plateau. It would therefore be reasonable to suppose that each climatic cycle was characterized by the formation of new-generation sinkholes, which led to dramatic water table drop and therefore the removal of the buoyant support of cavity roofs. Erol (1986, 1990) indicated the relationship between distributions of sinkholes and changes in the Quaternary lake level with detailed geomorphologic maps. The great majority of the sinkholes in the Obruk Plateau are located within the study area ( Fig. 7 ). Of the more than 100 older sinkholes, a few are located on the edges of the Karapınar-Hotamış Plain. Large sinkholes are easily detected on topographical maps. Tens of sinkholes several meters deep, ranging in diameter between several meters and several hundred meters, could only be determined with the aid of aerial photographs and fieldwork, since they were too shallow or ruined and had become in filled to detect otherwise. There are several significant, large sinkholes in the KCB that contain lakes, because they extend down to the water table. Of these, Meyil and Çıralı obruks are in the study area, while Kızören, Timraş and Apa are in different parts of the basin. In addition, there are a number of large and deep sinkholes, such as the Ak, Potur, Karain, Kangallı and Kızıl obruks, located north of the study area ( Fig. 7 and Table 1 ). While some of the old sinkholes are collapse sinkholes, formed directly as a result of the collapse karstic void roofs in the İnsuyu limestone, some are caprock sinkholes ( Lowe and Waltham, 2002; Waltham and Fookes, 2003; Ford and Williams, 2007 ), formed in the non-karst rocks over the limestone in the plateau (A–A′ cross-section in Fig. 8 ). While some of the non-karst rocks in the plateau were deposited in lacustrine environments during the Neogene or Quaternary ( Ulu, 2009a ), some are composed of terrestrial sediments such as alluvial fan, colluviums. Most of the terrestrial sediments are located in uvalas on the plateau ( Erol, 1990 ). Combined paleo-sinkholes, which have lost their characteristics to a great extent as a result of erosion and infilling and/or karstic subsidence, have contributed greatly to the formation of uvalas. Secondary and third generation caprock sinkholes were formed in the uvalas (A–A′ cross-section in Fig. 8 ). 3 Results Information gathered from local residents, publications, and official institutions suggests that the oldest sinkholes which are known to have been newly formed in the vicinity of Karapınar date from 1977. In the 33 years since then, 19 sinkholes have formed ( Fig. 7 and Table 2 ). Between 1977 and 2000, six sinkholes (Akviran, Nebili, Sekizli, Yirce, Kolca and Yavşan Çukuru obruks) occurred in the vicinity of Karapınar. The first of these was Akviran Obruk, formed in 1977. Among the sinkholes situated at elevations between 1033 and 1090 m on the Obruk Plateau, the deepest is Akviran Obruk (78 m), and the widest is Kolca Yayla Obruk (52 m), formed in 1995 ( Fig. 9 ). All of these sinkholes are caprock sinkholes formed in relatively low-lying Quaternary sedimentary areas within the plateau, defined by Erol (1986, 1990) as uvalas. These sinkholes formed in and around the summer pasture settlements or roadsides. Between 2006 and 2009, 13 sinkholes have formed in and around summer pasture settlements in the vicinity of Karapınar. Two of these sinkholes, the İnoba and Akkuyu (Yarımoğlu) III obruks, were covered by the national media due to their large size ( Table 2 ) and the hazards they presented. Because these 13 sinkholes are situated in six different locations, they will be discussed in groups; the six sinkholes formed in the vicinity of the Seyithacı settlement belong to the Seyithacı obruks; the three sinkholes in the vicinity of Akkuyu settlement form the Akkuyu obruk group. The Inoba, Küpbasan, Eşeli and Akviran II obruks do not form part of a group and will be discussed separately. 3.1 Seyithacı Obruks Between April 2007 and October 2008, six sinkholes of various dimensions formed in and around the Seyithacı settlement situated on the adjacent part of the Obruk Plateau to the plain (1008–1011 m) ( Figs. 7 and 10 and Table 2 ). This settlement was separated by faults from the Obruk Plateau (1100 m) and Karapınar Plain (1000 m). On the walls of Seyithacı sinkholes, there is green clay (1 m thickness) overlying the limestone; and there is soil of 0.5 m thickness above the clay. Seyithacı sinkholes formed in the İnsuyu limestone are defined as collapse sinkholes due to thin caprock despite this stratigraphic section. Of the six Seyithacı sinkholes, four were formed in agricultural lands several hundred meters from the settlement ( Fig. 10 A, E, F and G) and the remaining two (Seyithacı II and III sinkholes), which are wider than the others, formed within the settlement ( Fig. 10B, C and D ). Seyithacı II sinkhole formed 10 m west of the settlement access road in the middle of a pathway. It is situated 30 m from local houses. 0.8 m clay above limestone, and ∼0.5 m soil is present above this sediment on the wall of the sinkhole. Seyithacı III sinkhole formed in the north part of the settlement, at a distance of 30 m from both the road and houses ( Fig. 10 C and D). Circular tension fractures 20 cm in width extend 2 m from the sinkhole, and indicate that the diameter of the sinkhole is likely to enlarge to at least ∼4 m within a short time. The lithologic structure of the sinkhole wall is the same as Seyithacı II. 3.2 Küpbasan Obruk This sinkhole, which is on the Quaternary lake deposits on the edges of the Karapınar Plain, is situated at an elevation of 1002 m. The sinkhole formed in the center of Küpbasan summer pasture settlement. Local people attempted to fill the 6 m deep sinkhole with back fill. It could be defined as a caprock sinkhole, because the non-karstic rocks in which it was formed are relatively thick compared to the Seyithacı sinkholes. 3.3 İnoba Obruk This sinkhole formed during late 2008 on the west side of İnoba settlement, 30 km southwest of Karapınar. The sinkhole is 50 m from the settlement houses ( Fig. 11 A) at the edge of the Karapınar Plain, which is 8 m higher than the plain bottom and surrounds the settlement of İnoba on the west. The sinkhole is 24 m in diameter and, since it is 35 m deep, it intersects the water table and a lake has formed within it ( Fig. 11 B). Approximately 250 m to the south of İnoba sinkhole, there is a larger old sinkhole. İnoba Obruk was formed in non-karst Quaternary lacustrine sediments composed of clay, marl, silt and red mudstone layers of various colors and thicknesses (C–C′ cross-section in Fig. 8 ). The thickness of some of the silt layers exceeds 1 m. Due to this characteristic, İnoba Obruk is defined as a caprock sinkhole. For 2 days prior to the formation of the sinkhole, local people heard noises underground. Intermittent sounds, originating from underground over a period of 2 days, caused villagers to leave their houses in the evenings for fear of an earthquake. Some local residents mentioned that they heard these noises while they were in their houses and that the frightening noises coming from underground sounded like a large mass falling into water (personal communication: Mehmet Köroğlu, a resident of İnoba Yayla). On the morning of the third day, a newly-formed sinkhole was observed. According to this piece of information, the dramatic fall of the water table and high seasonal fluctuations caused both the increase in the effective weight of the karstic void span and the fall of rocks from the span. Thus, the karstic void roof could not bear the load and collapsed. 3.4 Akkuyu Obruks During 2007 and 2008, three sinkholes formed in the vicinity of Akkuyu summer pasture. The first two were named Akkuyu Obruk I and Akkuyu Obruk II, according the order in which they formed. The third obruk was the largest and was named Yarımoğlu Obruk by the local people. However, this sinkhole is referred to as Akkuyu Obruk III in this publication. Akkuyu Obruk I (which is located on the Plateau) and Akkuyu Obruk II are caprock sinkholes with diameters of ∼15 m and depths of 1 m. Since these sinkholes are not very deep, only soil is visible in their wall. They were formed due to the sag of the caprock. Akkuyu (Yarımoğlu) Obruk III is 15 km west of Karapınar, situated 200 m north of the Karapınar-Konya highway, and 500 m from farmhouses in Akkuyu ( Fig. 12 ). It formed while maize was being harvested in a field on the edges of the Hotamış Plain. The sinkhole is 35.8 m deep; the mouth is 20.4 m wide in a north–south direction and 24.8 m wide in an east–west direction. Many fractures are visible within several meters around the sinkhole. These fractures and the slope profile of the sinkhole indicate that enlargement will occur in the future. There is a lake at the bottom of the sinkhole, which reaches the water table. This sinkhole is a caprock sinkhole formed in non-karstic sediments on the limestone (B–B′ cross-section in Fig. 8 ). 3.5 Eşeli Obruk Eşeli Obruk is located in the northwest of Eşeli summer pasture, at an altitude of 1036 m (on the Plateau). Its diameter is 15.9 m and the depth is 0.85 m. It is a shallow sinkhole, similar to the Akkuyu I and Akkuyu II obruks. 3.6 Akviran Obruk II This sinkhole was formed on the Obruk Plateau. Even though the sinkhole formed south of Akviran Obruk is relatively very small, it is important in the sense that it indicates that there are still hazards on the plateau. 4 Discussion The sinkholes developed on karstic voids which were formed within the İnsuyu Formation limestone by karst groundwater. The increasing effective weight of the load on the roofs of these voids caused them to collapse, forming sinkholes. These small karstic voids (or cavities) have been documented by several boreholes in the Obruk Plateau. The groups of Seyithacı obruks are collapse type and the other sinkholes are caprock types. While changes in the groundwater level related to the Quaternary climate cycles became influential in the formation of paleo-sinkholes, human activities together with natural karst processes have triggered the formation of many new sinkholes (particularly between 2006 and 2009 years). Excessive pumping from the underground and climatic aridity has contributed to falling of the water table by approximately 24 m during the last 26 years. High amplitude progressive seasonal fluctuations of the water table (related to pumping of the summer months) have caused existing karstic voids to migrate upward. In particular, breaks in caprocks have caused unsupported roofs to weaken from the bottom. Hydraulic support from groundwater on the cavity roofs disappeared as the water table dropped. This affected cavity roofs, increasing the effective load on the spans and causing roofs to collapse. Therefore, unlike paleo-sinkholes, sinkholes formed recently near Karapınar stem from both natural processes and human activities. The altitudes and geographical distributions of the sinkholes formed in recent years support the concept that water table decline has induced the collapse of cavity roofs. Among the sinkholes formed in the last 33 years, all of those formed before 2000 emerged on the plateau, but in the bottoms of the uvalas, which are relatively lower; those formed after 2006 (except for Akviran II, Akkuyu I and Eşeli obruks) emerged on the low lying adjacent part of the Plateau to the plain and edges of the Karapınar-Hotamış Plain (∼8–10 m higher than the lower part of plain). This spatial distribution and time relationship show that the first sinkholes formed in the uvala bottoms – with relatively thin karstic void roofs – between 1977 and 2000 when the water table was higher (∼24 m and 13 m, respectively) than the present time. The water table dropped further (∼13 m) between 2000 and 2008, leading to conditions under which cavity roofs collapsed largely on the edge of plateau and plain. The sudden fall (measuring up to 8 m) of the water table, particularly between the years 2005 and 2008, strengthens the evidence for a relationship between water table decline and the formation of new sinkholes. With the exception of Akrivan II, Akkuyu I and Eşeli obruks, sinkholes that have formed within the last 4 years (2006–2009) are situated at very similar altitudes (between 1002 and 1011 m), further evidence for a relationship between falling water table and cavity collapses. The findings of the present research support the earlier conclusions by Erol (1986, 1990) , suggesting that sinkhole formation in the Konya Basin is triggered by changes in groundwater level. Erol stated that groundwater flowed from the Paleo-Konya Lake to the Tuz Lake, which occurred during pluvial (wet) periods in the Quaternary, thereby enlarging the voids, and that sinkhole formation took place during the period in at least in four stages, as a result of the regression in lake levels (water tables) during the interglacial periods. In addition, Canik and Çörekçioğlu (1986) found that the groundwater contained high levels of CO 2 as a result of Plio-Quaternary volcanism. CO 2 accelerates karstic dissolution, leading to sinkhole formation ( Canik and Çörekçioğlu, 1986 ). Bayarı et al. (2009b) proposed that sinkholes are formed through hypogenic karstification, in which particularly strong geogenic carbon dioxide oscillation is effective. In addition, slope profiles of newly-formed sinkholes invalidate previous evaluations ( Erinç, 1960; Bayarı et al., 2009b ) of the formation mechanisms based on the slope profiles of giant paleo-sinkholes such as Kızören, Çıralı, Meyil and Timraş obruks ( Fig. 1 ). Therefore, it may be suggested that concave or convex slopes seen in the slope profiles of sinkholes have developed as a result of changes in the lithology of the bedrock forming the sinkhole walls; partial collapses in the mouth and on the walls after sinkhole formation; and rock falls and erosion. Many sinkholes have formed around Karapınar, on the Obruk Plateau and at the edges of the Karapınar-Hotamış Plain since the beginning of the Quaternary. However, increased human influence is causing the dramatic water table decline in the KCB, which most likely has a more significant influence on the formation of sinkholes in recent years in comparison to climatic factors. Accordingly, it appears that newly-formed sinkholes on the Obruk Plateau and plain were formed through a combination of natural and human influences. In addition, considering the mostly random distribution of old and new sinkholes on the plateau and plain; and the many paleo-sinkholes intersecting one another, it can be suggested that sinkholes were formed on network or spongework type karst conduits developed in the horizontal lacustrine limestone of the İnsuyu Formation. On the other hand, it can be said that many of the sinkholes extending along the northwest–southeast direction on the plateau and located in a line between Meyil and Çıralı obruks were formed on the same conduit ( Fig. 7 ; A–A′ cross-section in Fig. 8 ). 5 Hazard of karst collapse Observation of sinkhole, those formed between the years 1977 and 2000, and geomorphic–hydrographic data imply that sinkholes are less likely to be formed in the plateau compared to the plains, but that they have the potential to be larger. The hazard of sinkhole formation in central sections of the plains is greatly reduced by the thickness of Quaternary sediment above the limestone (more than 100 m thick in some sections) and the formation of karst is not good because of the high water table. Overall, sinkhole formation in the last 33 years has advanced from the plateau (relative altitude 40–100 m) towards the plain as a result of the falling of the water table. It could be argued that if the water table continues to drop in future years, the susceptibility of sinkholes will remain mainly for the edge of the Karapınar-Hotamış Plain, the low lying adjacent part of the plateau to the plain and parts of the Obruk Plateau. Settlements in the Obruk Plateau (Akviran, Kolca, Sekizli summer pastures, etc.) may also face a slight hazard of collapse. Especially the high hazard levels might also occur at the edge of the Karapınar-Hotamış Plain and the low lying part of the plateau adjacent to the plain (particularly in and around Seyithacı, Küpbasan, Akkuyu, İnoba summer pastures). This prediction is corroborated by the presence of the paleo-Atçukuru Obruk on the plain to the south of the Karapınar-Konya road ( Erol, 1990 ) ( Fig. 7 ) and also several paleo-sinkholes situated in the plain side, several meters below the new sinkholes in the vicinity of the İnoba and Seyithacı. These paleo-sinkholes must have been formed during periods when the water table was close to its present level or lower. The sinkholes prior to 2000 were generally formed in the vicinity of the summer pastures in the Obruk Plateau, where transportation and human activities are not very dense and several families live, mainly engaged in stockbreeding. This situation decreased hazard in terms of human safety and property security. However, new sinkholes formed in settlements and in the vicinity of highways have become a threat to life and property. 6 Conclusion Nineteen sinkholes of various dimensions have formed during the last 33 years (most of them during the past 4 years, between 2006 and 2009) on the Obruk Plateau and side of the Karapınar-Hotamış Plain. Formation of collapse and caprock sinkholes was triggered by natural processes, human-induced lowering of the water table, and increased seasonal fluctuations in the water table level. Recent sinkholes in the vicinity of Karapınar vary in age they formed in succession on the Obruk Plateau and spread to the Karapınar-Hotamış Plain. This orientation indicates that sinkhole formation in the KCB has been triggered by drops of groundwater level (around 24 m in the last 26 years) largely caused by human activities. The fact that the Obruk Plateau is 40–100 m higher than the adjacent plain allows the roof thickness above the voids to be thicker, thereby limiting the number of sinkholes formed in these areas in contrast to the edge of the Karapınar-Hotamış Plain and the low lying adjacent part of the plateau to the plain. The results presented in this paper raise awareness and the local decision makers should take into account the collapses. Therefore, illegal deep wells must be closed, in order the loss of life and property to sinkholes and the cultivation of crops which are not naturally able to withstand the climatic conditions of the basin should cease. Subsequently, water pumping must be controlled via licensed deep wells and reduced to the minimum level necessary, and further depletion of the water table must be prevented. In addition, immediate action must be taken to identify underground voids or conduits (using such methods as geophysics and drilling), particularly in Seyithacı, Küpbasan, İnoba, and the Akkuyu summer pasture settlements, in the vicinity of Karapınar-Konya road, and in some settlements in the plateau. The immediate hazards of sinkhole formation might be reduced by recharging the aquifer using surface-water from within the basin or from an adjacent basin. However, this approach is problematic, as there are insufficient water resources within the basin for this operation; also, it is very difficult to divert water from adjacent basins, due both to water stress in these areas and the high costs involved. Therefore, there is an urgent need to implement a water management action plan in the KCB.

5f0e32bf9fced0a24b630583,Effect of residual tectonic stresses on roadway stability in an underground coal mine,,[{'name': 'B.  Unver'}],"Yeni Çeltek Colliery is located in the north west of Anatolia, 36 km from Bolu Province. Total lignite reserve in the mine area is about 6.5 million tons. Because of the presence of tectonic and lithological problems only 1.5 million tons of lignite are suitable for production. Cores obtained from exploration boreholes were analysed and the following properties related to the coal seam were found: Ash Content 17.10 % Moisture Content 4.40 % Sulphur Content 9.23 % Calorific Value 4100-5500 kcal/kg There are several mining methods implemented, namely; retreat shortwall with caving, bord-and-pillar and blasting galleries. Although the coal seam contains a high amount of sulphur and production methods are conducive to spontaneous combustion there has never been any serious mine fire experienced. Since the sulphur content of the coal is very high, it is not suitable for use as domestic fuel. However, it is very much in demand by nearby brick factories. Strata around the mine had been affected by major tectonic movements resulting in the formation of extensive folds as anticlines and synclines . Main roadways have been driven in marl and clay. There was an asymmetric syncline in the vicinity of main roadways forming a complex stress state. Clay bands surrounding the roadways had different swelling potentials adversely affecting the stability of the roadway. There has always been a great problem of stability in the mine due to closure in the roadways. Dinting and ripping had to be done frequently to maintain transportation and ventilation functions of roadways. This study defines and analyses the source and mechanizm of instability problems in the main roadways and to establish the necessary measures to be taken in order to maintain stability.",,

Observed golden sedge rhizome and root depths among three specimens, one per site, ranged from 6 to 8 cm below the soil surface, which suggested primarily topsoil influence. A total of 96 soil samples, 48 topsoil and 48 subsoil, were collected in transects and analyzed. Mean pH values within populations were very strongly (4.7) to moderately (5.7) acid for topsoils and moderately (5.8) to slightly (6.5) acid for subsoils. These values did not differ significantly inside versus immediately outside each population, but varied among topsoils and subsoils between populations. Other soil variables associated with marl and limestone parent material influence (i.e., cation exchange capacity, base saturation, calcium, and magnesium) did not exhibit any consistent trends either inside versus outside, or between populations.

In some localities this same saliferous mass is also interbedded within Upper Aptian marls, well dated by planktonics. From new stratigraphic, sedimentologic and tectonic data and referencial models taking in account the recent improvements in the Gulf Coast restorations, this organization is interpreted as a composite submarine ""salt glacier"" emplaced during Aptian-Albian times, in a shallow water environment and over a synsedimentary slope, in the frame of a palacogeographic setting, characterized by extensional tilted blocks. The lower contact of this composite ""salt glacier"" is poorly mineralized by traces of barytine and, on the contrary the upper contact is underlined by interesting and probably polyphase concentrations of celestite. Pb-Zn sulphides and sonic sulfur. The large saliferous Triassic body studied in this area does not show the supposed negative gravimetric anomalies. normally expected from the ""classical"" drapiric hypothesis. Oil the contrary. they are characterized by positive anomalies reaching in the Fedj el Adoum area, the highest local value. This interpretation is also supported by a neighbouring seismic profile and by old or recent drillings. A comparison with the extensional genesis of submarine composite ""salt glaciers"" of the Gulf Coast continental margin allows to explain the Fedj el Adoum Triassic saliferous rocks as a body flowing along a marine slope over various Cretaceous levels and the same time the appearance of the Douamiss typical depocenter. We propose also a ""Gulf Coast"" solution in order to explain the surprising very strong positive axial gravimetric anomaly of the largest Tunisian ""true diapir"" of the J. Ech Chehid. With our interpretation, the recently proposed hypothesis of a lateral injections of salt under a thick sedimentary cover during the Tertiary late tectonic inversion stage, is unfounded. It is also not demonstrable by the sand-box modelling experiments. Precise and illustrated comparisons with others large submarine ""salt glaciers"" provinces (therefore difficult with central and western Maghreb and Betic Cordillera), allow us to identify single and/or composite comparable structures in Aquitaine offshore, Kazakhstan, Ukraina, Yemeni Red Sea margin, but also in the Western French Alps. In the last one, the proposed halokinetic zonation raises the question of the significance of the <<grandes zones de gypses>>. All large submarine ""salt glaciers"" in the world (length of more than 10 km), are apparently linked with the post-rift stage of areas overlying a thinned continental crust.",,

We attempted to determine the correlation between the presence of postextrasystolic changes in the STU segment and a history of sustained ventricular arrhythmias. Background. Postextrasystolic U wave augmentation (a marled increment in U wave amplitude after premature ventricular complexes [PVCs]) is an adverse prognostic sign in the ""pause-dependent long QT syndrome."" However, the prevalence of postextrasystolic changes in patients without the long QT syndrome is unknown. Methods. We compared the configuration of the STU segment of the postextrasystolic heat (the sinus beat after a PVC) with the Snr configuration during sinus rhythm in three patient groups: 1) 41 patients with spontaneous ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) (VT/VF group), 2) 63 patients with heart disease and high grade ventricular arrhythmias (control group), and 3) 29 patients with high grade ventricular arrhythmias but no heart disease (reference group). Results. Postextrasystolic T wave changes did not correlate with a history of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, However, postextrasystolic U wave changes were more common among the patients with VT/VF than among control subjects (39% vs. 8.7%, p < 0,001), By logistic multiple regression analysis, a low left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.001) and postextrasystolic U wave changes (p < 0.005) were independent predictors of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Conclusions. Postextrasystolic T Have changes are common and lack predictive value, Postextrasystolic U wave changes may be a specific marker of a tendency to the development of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. Prospective studies should be performed to confirm this association. (C) 1996 by the American College of Cardiology",,

Due to the considerable costs of detailed ground surveys of this phenomenon, remote sensing is an appropriate alternative for analyzing and evaluating the risks of the expansion of soil degradation. In this paper, we characterize the state of land degradation in a small Mediterranean watershed using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data and ground-based spectroradiometric measurements. The two visible, the near-infrared and six shortwave infrared bands of the above sensor were calibrated using ground measurements of the spectral reflectance. Field measurements were carried out in the Saboun experimental basin located in the marl soil region of the Moroccan western Rif. The study leads to the development and evaluation of a new spectral approach to express land degradation. This index called Land degradation index (LDI) is based on the concept of the soil line derived from spectroradiometric ground measurements. In this study, we compare LDI and the spectral angle mapping (SAM) approaches to assess and map land degradation. Results show that LDI provides more accurate results for mapping land degradation (Kappa=0.79) when compared to the SAM method (Kappa=0.61). Validation and evaluation of the results are based on the thematic maps derived from the ground data (organic matter, clay, silt and sand) by kriging, DEM, slope gradient and photointerpretation.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/D7/46/A6/D746A640A91B8D1622B1E312CC131007.pdf

Most planktic foraminifers exhibit a high-frequency cyclicity in their distribution pattern and show little relationship to the sequence stratigraphic subdivision. A few characteristic species of benthic foraminifers (Tritaxia pyramidata, Ataxophragmium compactum, Dorothia levis, and Gavelinella cenomana) are related in their frequency distribution to certain systems tracts. Other benthic foraminiferal species are more evenly distributed through the systems tracts. Cluster analysis and factor analysis allow the separation of three benthic foraminiferal biofacies domains, which exhibit a characteristic frequency distribution pattern with respect to sequence stratigraphy. Biofacies 1 is dominant in the highstand systems tract (HST), and biofacies 3 is characteristic for the transgressive systems tract (TST). Biofacies 2 is most abundant around the maximum flooding-downlap surface (mfs) and less abundant around the sequence boundary. Factor analysis shows that most of the variance in the data set is explained by variables related to plankton productivity. Variables related to changes in water depth and changes in sea-level have minor influence on the variance of the whole data set, but have some influence on the variance of the benthic foraminiferal data set. The different reaction of benthic and planktic foraminifers to relative sea-level changes is also recorded in the total number of foraminifers per gram sediment (foraminiferal number) and in the ratio between planktic and benthic foraminifers (p/b-ratio). The foraminiferal number is highest at the mfs and lowest at the sequence boundaries of the investigated depositional sequences. The p/b-ratio has no correlation with the sequence stratigraphic subdivision, but shows a high-frequency cyclicity. The abundance pattern of planktic foraminifers is controlled by changes in the productivity of calcareous plankton. The regular variation in calcareous plankton productivity leads to marl (low productivity)-chalk (high productivity) cycles that form conspicuous couplets in the section. The productivity cycles are also recorded in gamma-ray logs in the environmental setting of the Escalles section. In contrast, the abundance patterns of benthic foraminifers are more influenced by relative sea-level changes, changes in water depth, and variations in substrate composition. The stacking of probably precession-controlled development of couplets lead to a distinct 100,000-year cyclicity that does not match very well with published sequence stratigraphic subdivisions.

Biostratigraphical tie points are furnished by ammonites, dinoflagellates, calpionellids, and ostracod-charophyte assemblages. The hierarchical stacking of small-scale depositional sequences reflects Milankovitch cyclicity: sequences corresponding to the 20-, 100-, and, locally, 400-ka orbital cycles can be identified. Elementary (20 ka) sequences on the platform generally consist of one bed of shallow subtidal to intertidal, high-or low-energy carbonate facies, whereas on the slope and in the basin they are commonly developed as limestone-marl;couplets. These elementary sequences group into small-scale composite sequences reflecting the first orbital eccentricity cycle (100 ka), which in turn build up large-scale (3rd-order) composite sequences. One 3rd-order sequence has been analysed in detail: according to the cyclostratigraphic interpretation, it took approximate to 2 Myr to form, which is in accordance with the duration of the corresponding ammonite subzones. Sequence-stratigraphic and cyclostratigraphic platform-to-basin correlation shows that for about 900 ka the platform was exposed or only partly flooded, whereas on the slope and in the basin, lowstand deposits with channel fills and slumps accumulated. With rising sea level, accommodation space gradually increased on the platform and a thickening-upward sequential pattern with transgressive facies developed, while in the basin the facies still had lowstand characteristics with thick and nodular limestone beds. This situation lasted about 700 ka. The following 300 ka were characterized by sediment starvation and increased bioturbation on the platform, and by more marry, transgressive sediments on the slope and in the basin. The maximum-flooding phase is more or less isochronous on the platform and in the basin, although the surface with the best-developed maximum-flooding features may be displaced by one or two small-scale composite sequences because of superimposed high-frequency sea-level fluctuations, and/or local variations in substrate morphology and sediment distribution. Third-order highstand conditions prevailed for only about 100 ka. The combination of cyclostratigraphy and high-resolution sequence stratigraphy, constrained by good biostratigraphy, is thus a powerful tool for detailed stratigraphical correlation over long distances and from one sedimentary environment to another.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/D1/E3/00/D1E3007415674E6DF1DF5ACAEFC77BC9.pdf

The 12–1/4"" section is generally drilled in three main intervals with RSS/PDM. New PDC bit technology was developed to efficiently drill two of these sections with controllable torque response and consistent directional behavior while achieving maximum ROP and durability. Several new bit designs were implemented and tested at the manufacturer's surface simulator with good results. The upper interval from the 13–3/8"" shoe originally used 8-bladed 13mm cutter PDC down to the Maureen limestone (USC c.15,000psi). A 19mm 7-bladed PDC featuring reduced exposure and advanced cutter technology was introduced. This design achieved a drilling record from the 13–3/8"" shoe to the top Tor in one run where previously two bits had been required. In addition there was improved steerability on a motor through the Lista Formation; previously this had been considered directionally challenging. The same section on the next well with this bit design achieved a field footage record of 9,534ft. The lower Cretaceous chalk section from the top Tor was originally drilled with 6-bladed PDC with 16mm/13mm cutters. Historically PDC bits slowed to unacceptable ROP with only minimal wear due to the rounded diamond lip proving unable to penetrate the Chalks. An application specific 7 bladed 16mm cutter design was introduced featuring latest technology cutters, and a customized back up cutter layout. This design drilled 4,500ft from the top Tor Formation with no visible wear. This section had previously required 2–3 PDC bits. During this same time, the service company was also matching the closed-loop RSS system with the ever changing PDC bit technology. The development of the RSS in combination with the advancing PDC technology played a large role in the performance improvement. The authors will describe field results and developments leading to this performance step-change. Introduction The Britannia field is a large natural gas condensate field situated 210km (130 miles) north-east of Aberdeen and covers approximately 112km2 (70 square miles) (Figure 1). The Britannia reservoir lies in the Upper to Lower Cretaceous Formations (Cromer Knoll Group) at approximately 12,500 ft - 13,000 ft TVD. Long term back-to-back development well drilling and multiple 12 ¼"" polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bitruns per section provide a challenge for the latest in PDC technology. The Central North Sea (CNS) Cretaceous formations are dominated by chalk and marl groups (Figure 2) which have long been recognized as a significant drilling challenge, limiting both drilling performance and development drilling options. New wells normally drill the Cretaceous in 12–1/4"" hole size (Figure 3). Typical challenges encountered are:Unpredictable, widely varying and normally low rate of penetration (ROP)Troublesome oriented drilling with steerable motorsHighly cemented formation boundariesHole spiraling and ledgingHigh friction factorsHigh levels of drilling vibrationUnpredictable but strong natural directional tendencyPotential instability These challenges have limited well trajectories being planned through the Cretaceous to either tangent or drop. Only in extreme circumstances were directional course changes planned in the initial wells drilled in the field as it significantly increased well costs and operational risk. Today, sophisticated PDC bit technology used in combination with rotary steerable systems (RSS) and high-torque motors has allowed efficient steering in extended reach and sub-horizontal wells.",,

In consideration of the lithofacies and sedimentary characteristics of other sections in Jiufotang Formation of Kazuo basin, the authors chose the tuffaceous rock association as the marker bed or the bed set and, on such a basis, divided the type section of Jiufotang Formation into four members called 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. The authors found that the Jiufotang Formation is mainly composed of siltstone and pelite, intercalated with numerous extremely tiny layered limestone or marl, characterized by the upward sedimentary evolution from shore shallow lake facies through deep lake facies intercalated with shallow lake facies to shallow lake facies. The differences between Xiaogushan-Jiushaoguo section and other sections in Jiufotang Formation indicate that the clastic rock granularity of Xiaogushan-Jiushaogou section was finer in general, without the development of delta facies and fan delta facies.

Such a stratigraphic unit results lithologically heterogeneous, and is representative of a very long time span (from the Early Cretaceous to the Oligocene) during which very important geological events took place, such as the convergence and collisional events giving rise to the edification of the Northern Apennines orogene. We have studied several key outcrops of the Scaglia Toscana exposed in the Rapolano Terme area (Southern Tuscany, Northern Apennines) in order to contribute to the reconstruction of the depositional setting and palaeogeographical features of a sector of the Tuscan Domain from the Cretaceous to the Early Miocene, and to hypothesise a possible geodynamic evolution.

The Scaglia Toscana exposed in the Rapolano Terme area has been deeply investigated through lithostragraphic and biostratigraphic analyses mainly carried out in three key areas indicated in the fig. 1: 1) the Podere Cetinaia-Podere Monte Petroso section; 2) the Podere Le Rossole section; and 3) the Modanella-Podere Campo d’Aia section. From the top (represented by the overlying Macigno Fm) to the bottom (Maiolica Fm) we have recognized three litostratigraphic units: 

1. Claystones and calcarenites ( Argilliti e calcareniti di Dudda ), containing lenses of nummulite bearing calcarenites and calcirudites («Nummulitico», Calcareniti di Montegrossi ). The thickness ranges from 50 to 100 m; Middle-Late Eocene.

2. Silty marls and claystones ( Marne siltose ed argilliti marnose rosse di Podere Le Rossole ) comparable for the age and stratigraphic position with the Marne del Sugame described in the Chianti Mts. The thickness does not exceed 10 m; Early-Middle Eocene.

3. Argilliti di Brolio consisting of three lithofacies: BRLa - manganesiferous radiolarites (thickness from 5 to 10 m); BRLb - siliceous siltstones (thickness of about 10 m); BRLc - red marly clays (thickness from 6 to 8 m); Albian-Turonian.

The boundary separating the Argilliti di Brolio from the overlying Marne siltose ed argilliti marnose rosse di Podere Le Rossole is representative of a time gap about 7Ma long (from 40 to 47Ma). According to Canuti & Marcucci (1967) we exclude the emersion during this time span, but we support for: i) the reduction of the sedimentation and/or; ii) submarine erosion induced by tectonic instability. Such possible hypotheses can be confirmed by the fact that the gap affects different stratigraphic horizons of the Argilliti di Brolio , and the sedimentation of the Marne siltose ed argilliti marnose rosse di Podere Le Rossole started diachronically. The sedimentary environment of the Marne siltose ed argilliti marnose rosse di Podere Le Rossole is pelagic-hemipelagic, characterised by Foraminifera bearing marly and pelitic sediments. The occurrence of thin bedded calcarenites indicates the formation of a turbidite system, mainly carbonate. Such a turbidite system typifies the overlying succession: the Argilliti e calcareniti di Dudda with interbedded Nummulites bearing calcarenites and calcirudites ( Calcareniti di Montegrossi ).

The stratigraphic contact between the Argilliti e calcareniti di Dudda and the Marne siltose ed argilliti marnose rosse di Podere Le Rossole lithostratigraphic units is gradual and continuous, and is characterized by the frequency and thickness increase of the turbite beds, as well as by the progressive appearance of the reddish color, moreover characterizing the overlying Marne siltose ed argilliti marnose rosse di Podere Le Rossole . The sedimentological features of the Argilliti e calcareniti di Dudda suggest a radical change of the sedimentary environment. In fact, the hemipelagic sediments were substituted by the turbidite systems. The turbidites are characterized by graded beds containing Eocene planktonic Foraminifera indicating an intrabasinal reworking of penecontemporaneous sediments. Contrarily, the calcarenites of the upper part of the succession are characterized by Cretaceous planktonic Foraminifera being bioclasts indicating an extrabasinal origin. This is indicative for the development of a carbonate turbidite system fed by Cretaceous sediments. The uppermost part of the succession is newly typified by the occurrence of calcarenite beds with intrabasinal Eocene planktonic Foraminifera. Such a lithological assemblage and palaeontological containts became a recurrent feature for the overlying Nummulites bearing calcarenites and calcirudites («Nummulitico», Calcareniti di Montegrossi ). Furthermore, these latter are characterized by Eocene benthonic Foraminifera suggesting the development of one or more lobes of a submarine fan channels fed by carbonate platforms. The Nummulite bearing calcarenites are characterized by a trend thinning-fining upward, and gradually pass to the Argilliti e calcareniti di Dudda , indicating the deactivation of the lobe fan system. Such a succession passes to the Macigno siliciclastic sandstone (Macigno Fm).

In sum, we hyphotesise that the embryonal foredeep system of the Northern Apennines could be developed since the Middle-Late Eocene with the activation of a carbonate turbidite system ( Argilliti e calcareniti di Dudda plus the Nummulites bearing calcarenites) successively evolved in a siliciclastic turbidite system represented by the Macigno Fm.

The sedimentary gap recorded within the Scaglia Toscana succession could indicate the records of the beginning of the tectonic activity which affected the Tuscan Domain for a long time, related to the development of the Northern Apennines foredeep system.",,

Oriented drilling using bent housing steerable motors is troublesome and rate of penetration is unacceptably slow with rotary steerable systems. This has historically resulted in well trajectories being planned with minimal directional course changes through these sequences and, when directional course changes are absolutely required, oil based mud is often required to facilitate oriented drilling. With many assets in the Central North Sea reaching maturity, directional drilling course changes in the Cretaceous has increasingly become a necessity to access remaining targets. Talisman Energy (UK) Limited acquired several CNS mature assets in the period 1997 - 2005. A challenge faced by the operator was to improve directional drilling control and overall drilling performance through the CNS Cretaceous while simultaneously moving away from oil based mud requirements. A new generation rotary steerable system which integrates a performance drilling motor with a high speed rotary steerable tool was introduced to meet this challenge. By applying this new system coupled with the latest steerable drill bit technology, precise three dimensional trajectories are now being drilled at more than double the offset rates of penetration & water based mud can now be used more frequently. The results have been easier access to remaining reserves, a dramatic reduction in drilling time, lower environmental impact and overall reduced cost and risk. This paper describes the drilling conditions in the CNS and the new drilling technology applied. It also describes the challenges encountered applying new technology on cost sensitive mature assets, procedures put in place to minimise operational risk while introducing the new system and a comparison of performance now compared with that of offset wells. Introduction The UK Central North Sea (CNS) covers an area from block 14 in the North through block 31 in the South (Figure 1) and is an important area for North Sea hydrocarbon production. A number of fields discovered here in the 1970's, were quickly developed and commenced production in the late 1970's or early 1980's. Many are still producing but are past peak production. A challenges faced by the operators is to maintain economic recovery from these maturing assets. The primary source of production is from Jurassic sands with some fields producing from the Lower Cretaceous itself. To reach these producing zones, it is necessary to drill through the Cretaceous sequence of formations. The CNS Cretaceous formations are dominated by chalk and marl groups as illustrated in Figure 2. Since development drilling first commenced in the CNS back in the early 1970's, the CNS Cretaceous has been recognized as a significant drilling challenge, limiting both drilling performance and development drilling options. New wells normally drill the Cretaceous in 12 ¼″ hole size while re-entry wells frequently drill it in 8 ½″ size. Typical challenges encountered are:Unpredictable, widely varying and normally low rate of penetration (ROP)Troublesome oriented drilling with steerable motors or turbinesHole spiraling and ledgingHigh friction factorsHigh levels of drilling vibrationUnpredictable but strong natural directional tendency.",,

Ciledug Raya'}, {'name': 'Cipulir  Kav'}, {'name': 'Kebayoran  Lama'}, {'name': 'Jakarta  Selatan'}, {'name': 'Palynova  Limited'}]","Rich palynomorph assemblages have been obtained through a marine Oligocene succession from the East Java Sea (Indonesia) and provide the first instance of an independently dated Oligocene succession from SE Asia that has yielded a good quality palynological record. The succession has been independently dated by nannofossils and foraminifera. The palynomorph succession suggests climatic control on Oligocene vegetation, on which basis a regionally applicable zonation is proposed. The Early Oligocene is characterized by common rain forest elements, suggesting an everwet, rain forest climate. The early part of the Late Oligocene contains much reduced rain forest elements with grass pollen, indicating a more seasonal climate, whereas for the latest Late Oligocene, rain forest elements return in abundance, suggesting a superwet rain forest climate. This palynological succession is similar to that from the Sunda Basin in the West Java Sea, allowing the Sunda Basin succession to be dated by correlation. The study also extends the stratigraphic range of Dacrydium and Casuarina, two plant taxa previously thought to have dispersed from the Australian Plate into SE Asia at the time of the collision with Sunda, to well before the time of collision. A different means of dispersal for these taxa is proposed. The area of study is located on the off-shore of North Madura which is a part of the East Java basin (Fig. 1). This is a back-arc basin situated on the southern margin of the Sundaland. This basin covers an area over 54 000 km with an east–west alignment and accommodates sediment with a thickness of more than 2000 m (Pusoko et al. 2005). It is well known as an important hydrocarbon province in Indonesia. East Java has been an attractive area for oil exploration and new discovery continues to occur within this basin. A regional stratigraphy of the East Java basin is shown in Figure 1. The stratigraphic succession follows an internal Lemigas report and also Yulianto et al. (2000). Sedimentation commenced during the Middle Eocene, unconformably over Cretaceous metasedimentary and igneous basement rocks and Paleocene/Late Cretaceous ‘PreNgimbang’ sediments, with deposition of the Ngimbang Formation. The Ngimbang Formation consists of sands, coals and lacustrine shales in the lower part, and subsequently marine shales and limestones deposited during the Late Eocene and Early Oligocene, and forming the synrift phase of deposition within the basin. Subsequently, following a period of nondeposition/erosion during the mid Oligocene, during a period of post-rift tectonic quiescence, thick and extensive carbonates of the Kujung Formation formed over the major part of the area during Late Oligocene–Early Miocene (Johansen 2003). This was followed by clastics of the Tuban Formation during the latest Early Miocene. The Kujung Formation is divided into three units, generally termed Kujung Units III, II and I. Kujung unit III is the oldest (Late Oligocene) and consists of alternations of shale, sand and limestone. Kujung unit II is characterized by clastics and carbonates with a basal sandstone and formed during Late Oligocene–Early Miocene, whilst Kujung unit I is represented by widespread Early Miocene carbonate build-ups. The Kujung Formation is conformably overlain by the Tuban Formation which is dominated by claystones with the intercalation of foraminiferalrich marls forming during the Early Miocene in a deep shelf setting (Firdaus 2004), and includes the widespread Rancak reef limestone member. The younger Neogene succession consists of the Ngrayong, Wonocolo, Ledok and Mundu Formations. The Oligocene of the East Java Sea area is usually subdivided biostratigraphically using a combination of nannofossils and foraminifera. It is indeed one of the mainstay areas for larger foraminifera, with many classic papers from the onshore From: Hall, R., Cottam, M. A. & Wilson, M. E. J.

In the area NW of Madura, however, the Kujung Formation often contains interbedded clastics which introduce additional correlation problems, and to try to clarify correlations in this area well sections have been studied for palynology as well as the usual microfossil groups. Samples from two wells, termed Well X and Well Y, have been studied at 600 intervals for each discipline, with some analyses of sidewall cores. The traditional palynological zonation for SE Asia (Morley 1978, 1991) does not work well in this area, and so the succession has been divided into broad palynological assemblage zones, which appear to be controlled mainly by climate. Some pollen types previously found to be stratigraphically useful in the Sunda Basin have also been recorded, and can be used in this area to help define the zones. The palynological zones appear to provide the best criteria for correlation of the observed stratigraphic succession between the two wells. The age of the assemblage zones, however, is best determined on nannofossils, with support from larger foraminifera. This provides one of the first instances where an Oligocene palynological succession from the SE Asian region can be independently dated using marine fossils. For nannofossils, reference is made to the scheme of Martini (1971) as presented by Perch-Nielsen (1985). For planktonic foraminifera, the scheme of Blow (1969, 1979) is followed using taxon ranges as presented by Bolli & Saunders (1985), whereas the larger foraminiferal zonation follows Adams (1970). The timescale used is that of Gradstein et al. (2004). Based on the close similarities of the palynological succession with that from the Sunda Basin, it is possible to apply at least part of the zonation scheme in the non-marine Sunda Basin Talang Akar and Cibulakan Formations, thus providing the first direct indication of the age of these formations. Apart form providing a new, independently dated, palynological zonation this paper will also discuss the regional implications of the climatic succession The sequence is also characterized by the common occurrence of palynomorph taxa of Australasian origin, and the biogeographical implications of these records are considered.

ASR produced mobilization of alkalies towards the interior of reactive grains coupled with mobilisation of Ca2+ ions wich re-precipitate and react with alkali-silica rich fluids to produce a hard rim.

Such mass movements are likely to generate changes in the geophysical parameters characterizing the ground, which can be used to map the landslide body. In the last decade, geophysical techniques have been increasingly used for landslide investigation purposes. However, the success of any geophysical technique is overall controlled by the existence of a geophysical contrast differentiating the body to be mapped. For landslides affecting thick clay materials (from soft clay to shale or marl), electrical and seismic techniques have been mainly applied in the past. In this study, we attempt to physically characterize the deformation within a large slide (Avignonet) affecting laminated clays which were deposited in a glacially dammed lake during the Würm period. Clay deposits, which cover an area of 300 km 2 south of Grenoble (French Alps) and have a maximum thickness of 200 m, overlay compact alluvial layers and marly limestone of Mesozoic age. Piezometric data at Avignonet show that the water table is very shallow, implying that the slide developed in saturated clay. Several seismic and electrical profiles were performed in order to tentatively correlate the variations of P-wave (Vp) velocity, S-wave velocity (Vs) and electrical resistivity with geotechnical data and morphological observations. In such saturated and fine material, it turned out that only the S-wave velocity exhibits significant variations with the displacement rates and the morphological features. Vs values at shallow depth were found to be inversely correlated with displacement rates measured by GPS, with a division by at least a factor of 2 between the zones unaffected and strongly deformed by the landslide. These results suggest that Vs mapping could provide valuable information on the deformation state of the clay material and that the evolution of Vs with time could be used as an indicator for characterizing the landslide activity in the subsurface, including the evolution into a flow.",,

A direct observation of ancientaeolian systems is not always possibleas they are prone to erosion and to theremoval of sand into other, ﬂuvial andmarine systems. Although the aeoliandeposits may no longer be present,their former existence can be inferredon the basis of grain-size characteris-tics and aeolian features on grainsurfaces. Aeolian sediments indeedconstitute an important source formarine deposits (Kukal and Saadal-lah, 1973; Fryberger et al., 1983).Widespread, ﬁne-grained, very well-sorted quartz sandstones characterizeshallow-marine facies in the mid-Cre-taceous of the eastern Spain (IberianBasin). The good sorting and round-ness of the grains hint at the presenceof a nearby erg system, suggestive ofan arid climatic zone along the west-ern Tethyan Margin during the mid-Cretaceous.Geological settingThe Mesozoic Iberian Basin along thewestern Tethyan Margin has one ofthe more complete lower-middle Cre-taceous sedimentary records in Eur-ope. The Iberian Range is a NW–SEstriking intraplate fold belt generatedby the tectonic inversion of theIberian Basin during the Palaeogene(Fig. 1A,B) (Salas and Casas, 1993;Capote et al., 2002). This basin wasformed by crustal thinning duringthe Late Permian–Triassic and LateJurassic–Early Cretaceous rift stages(Salas and Casas, 1993; Arche andLo´pez-Go´mez, 1996). During thesecond rift stage, extensional sub-basins were formed as part of thelarger Maestrazgo Basin (i.e. the east-ern sector of the Iberian Basin;Fig. 1B) (Soria, 1997). Sands of boththe last synrift unit of these sub-basins(the Escucha Formation) and of theﬁrst post-rift unit of the Iberian Basin(the Utrillas Formation) were depos-ited across the estuarine, deltaic andﬂuvial environments (Fig. 1C) (Quer-ol et al., 1992).

The section contains 15 distinct sedimentary cycles of alternating dark- and light-coloured marls, while the gamma-ray attenuation record reveals an additional five to six cycles. The cycles in the lower half of the section are on average 5.3 m thick, as opposed to the cycles in the upper part, which have an average thickness of 3.1 m. Palynological results define the lithological alternations in both the lower and upper cycles in terms of periodic changes in humidity, where the light marls represent the humid periods and the dark marls the relatively dry periods. Changes in cycle thickness and shifts in average gamma-ray values suggest a rather abrupt decrease in sedimentation rate at V60 m in the section. This is confirmed by the magnetostratigraphy, which recorded four reversals, which ^ given the biostratigraphic constraints from the Lava locality ^ could be correlated unambiguously to subchrons C3An.1n and C3An.2n of the geomagnetic polarity time scale. With this magnetostratigraphic time control, the average duration of the cycles can be calculated to be constant in the entire section, and similar to precession. The astronomical origin of the cycles is confirmed by the results of spectral analyses of gamma-ray and susceptibility time series. The sedimentary cycles in the upper part of the Lava section are unambiguously tuned to insolation using the typical clustering of the cycles that follows the eccentricity cycle. The filtered gamma-ray record centred at 41 kyr confirms the tuning in the upper part and allows tuning of the lower part. The tuning results in accurate ages for the sedimentary cycles and polarity reversals that confirm the astronomical tuning of [Krijgsman et al., Nature 400 (1999) 652^655], but define more precisely the astronomical polarity time scale. fl 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

621947c95aee126c0fe46e9b,Eastern Grego-Roman Cities,,[{'name': 'Dora P. Crouch'}],"Only since the last two decades of the twentieth century have professional geologists been working specifically at Miletus, investigating the shiny white limestone on top at KalabakHill; the limestone of Theater Hill and Humei Hill; and the limestone of Zeytin Hill (at the west of the hill called Degirmen, west of Kalabak), with sandstone and tuff to the east. The stratigraphy at Miletus is as follows, beginning with the topmost modern layer: . . . Iron deposits in mountains east of Miletus and both iron and brown coal at Mt. Mykale (today Samsun Dag) north of the Meander River valley. Volcanic tuff. Soluble limestone: 200 m of Yatagan or Balat strata of marble with tufa, sand, and gravel from which springs emerge. Early Pliocene limestone, shiny white limestone cap 60–100 m thick, karstified but with few on-site springs, forming ridges, hills, and a thick layer of scree. Miocene marls, sandstones, conglomerates, and clays with springs. Pink-yellow sandstone, sometimes with tuff, around sides of hills. Older clayey limestone deposited in a lake environment. Former large bay, now a swampy river plain with rich alluvial soil. . . . Prof. B. Schröder and his team have done geological research in the area (1990–94) and published their findings swiftly, which I acknowledge with gratitude. Suspected faults run north and south of Kalabak Hill (recognized in C. Schneider 1997). The town of Akköy to the south, where the German archaeological house is located well above the mosquitoes of the archaeological site in the swampy plain, sits on limestone that forms a peninsular ridge, surrounded on three sides by sandstone with tuff. The west coast of Asia Minor is subject to strong relief, steep gradients, and high precipitation; the high amount of energy available allows rapid change in topography (Gage 1978: 621). In Ionia, on average, the sea has risen or the land has sunk 1.75 m since antiquity (Bintliff 1977: 24; 1992). The Greek cities of Asia Minor were without exception built on or next to karst terrain (V. Klemes, 1988, personal communication when he was president of the International Association for Karst Hydrology).",,

The Case Of The Rhodope Prefecture Coasts.",,"[{'id': '53f4341fdabfaec22ba6b72c', 'name': 'g s xeidakis'}, {'name': 'p delimani'}]","Approximately half of the world's population are living or working in a narrow zone of a 100 km from the world coastlines. In this paper the erosion problems appearing in the central part of the Greek Thrace coastline (Rhodope Prefecture), are examined. The coastline studied is more than 100 km long and belongs to Xanthi-Komotini tectonic basin and is not well developed economically yet. From geomorphologic point of view the aforementioned coastal zone is principally a hilly area, consisting of Miocene, loose to semi-consolidated deposits (gravels, sands, silty-clays and conglomerates). This material is impregnated with CaCO3 and/or SiO2, in various degrees, forming a caliche (calcrete) deposit at the lower part of the column. The impregnation material is increasing with depth forming nodules of CaCO3 in the upper layers and turning to hard marl limestone or calcareous sandstone at greater depth. Small torrent deltas are built at the exits of valleys to the sea. The serious problems of the coastal erosion are concentrated principally to the upper, loose or semi consolidated part of the sedimentary,column. The height of the coastal cliffs (bluffs) varies from one to 30 m and the rate of their retreat fluctuates from a few centimeters to 3 m/year. The causes of the coastal erosion is attributed to: (a) natural factors like sea waves and alongshore currents, subsidence of the broader area, increase of the sea water level, consistency of the material, etc. and (b) to human-induced changes e.g. regulation of water courses and construction of dams on the streams inland, which results in the depletion of sediments of the rivers' waters; construction of inlets, jetties, breakwaters and seawalls at the coastline; human induced subsidence due to groundwater over pumping, etc.",,

One of these formations is composed of carbonate and marl of a shallow-marine environment (Euphrates Formation), and the other formations are composed of a clastic terrestrial (fluviatile) deposits with some differences in the depositional conditions (Injana and Dibdibba formations). The isotopic delta C-13%, delta N-15% values, organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen contents, and atomic C/N ratios are used as evidence of depositional environment. Average delta C-13 values (in parts per thousand) for the Dibdiba, Injana and Euphrates formations are -25.4, -25.7 and -24.5, respectively; average delta N-15 values (in parts per thousand) are 4.44, 5.24 and 7.24 and average OC (in wt. %) is 0.13, 0.3 and 1.1, respectively. A significant variation in the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions between fluvial and marine deposits was recorded. The delta C-13, delta N-15 and C/N values indicate that the organic matter in the Euphrates Formation is of marine origin, whereas it is of terrestrial origin (fluviatile) in the Injana and Dibdibba formations. The C/N-atomic values are mostly high in the lnjana (37) and Dibddiba formations (51), suggesting greater input and/or preservation of terrestrial organic matter derived from land plants; the shallow-marine environment (Euphrates Formation) was characterized by a low C/N ratio (9) due to the algal-derived organic matter with limited input of terrestrial organic matter.",,

The surface deposits of gullies studied vary from silty-clays in the northern half of the territory, to silts in the middle to southern area and sands in the southern end of the region. Factorial analysis of geometrical and granulometrical variables showed the role of the M parameter as a discriminating value of gully cross section shape. The rate of gully head cutting is over 1.5 m/year for gullies cut in sandy deposits and under 1 m/year for the gullies cut in marls and clays. A model of gully development is proposed which shows an accelerated rate of gully development immediately downstream after their initiation and a reduced and even cessation of advance on attaining an equilibrium length.",,

Detailed mapping of sedimentary units in these basins, together with sedimentological and paleomagnetic analysis lead to the proposal of a new chronostratigraphic framework for Pliocene and Quaternary deposits. This chronostratigraphic setting rejects the synchronous character of the ""Pliocene Units"" previously referred to as: ""P.I"" (grey-blue marls), ""P.II"" (yellow calcarenites), and ""P.III"" (variegated silts and clays). Instead, tectonics would have controlled the paleogeographic evolution of the Eastern Betic realms, causing the lithofacies to occur repeated in space and time. The Plio-Pleistocene boundary in these basins is not accompanied by changes in geodynamic behaviour or climatic conditions. According to the paleomagnetic data, these changes occurred at different times during the Pleistocene in the different studied basins.",,

The negative δ13C values indicate a source of meteoric water for the Fe-rich fluids. More positive δ13C values are present in ankerite and in some calcite, both related with marine water. δ18O in ankerite indicates low-temperature hydrothermal conditions, while in calcite is showing either primary signatures or early diagenesis at low temperature. On the contrary, calcite displaying more negative δ13C and δ18O values represents a late mineral phase which was formed under meteoric diagenesis. Each chimney resulted from the precipitation of intergranular carbonate cement around a channellized flux of metal-rich fluid crossing a shallow-marine, unconsolidated, sandy-marl substrate.

This Ir anomaly originated from an impact event and is always stratigraphically and geochemically decoupled from the underlying spherule-rich ejecta deposit related to the Chicxulub event. In all sections examined, one to three glass spherule ejecta layers and one or two chondrite-dominated PGE anomalies are separated by a bioturbated siliciclastic deposit and/or hemipelagic marl, which indicates the occurrence of at least two impact events separated by a considerable amount of time. In addition, bentonite layers and Pt and Pd-dominated PGE anomalies below and above the K/T boundary indicate volcanic activity.

6229b5395aee126c0f85ff98,E-Mail Reference Responses from Academic ARL Libraries: An Unobtrusive Study,,[{'name': 'Kristine K. Stacy-Bates'}],"E-mail reference connects patrons with reference service providers who can find answers for them. How accurate are the responses to e-mail questions? How firm are libraries' guidelines for time of response, type of questions addressed, and category of user whose questions will be answered through e-mail reference? This article examines e-mail reference services provided by academic libraries in the Association of Research Libraries (111 sites). Sets of three pretested e-mail reference queries were sent to each of these libraries during February 2001. Twenty-one assessment questions were used to record characteristics of the e-mail reference service pages and characteristics of responses to the reference queries; comparisons were made between service policies as stated and as practiced. Assessment questions covered the topics of e-mail reference polities, services to non-affiliates, elements of reference interviews, features of reference service enabled by the e-mail medium, and accuracy of query answers. ********** Thank you for using the [name] University Library's Ask-a-Librarian service. Your question has been forwarded to the liaison librarian for Sure. This message appeared on the computer screen as a result of filling out an online form for an e-mail reference service and selecting Not Sure from a dropdown menu to indicate the subject of the submitted query. Providing Not Sure as a choice allowed for the amusing response above--perhaps suggesting an alternate job title for reference librarians. More important, the presence of this option was an acknowledgment that some patrons are unclear on how to categorize their information needs. One aim of reference service is to alleviate our patrons' uncertainty, and e-mail reference service can be a means for achieving that aim. E-mail reference service is now a common component of large academic libraries' services, and has been an established service for long enough that simply providing it no longer suffices. It is time to look at the quality of the service provided in this area. Quality can be affected by a library's choices in setting policies for email reference service, planning it, staffing it, and advertising for it. But none of these things is the actual service. To measure the quality of the output of e-mail reference, it is necessary to examine the e-mailed query responses. Patron satisfaction with e-mail reference service has been measured for individual libraries, but this does not allow for comparisons among libraries or give a picture of the overall quality of electronic reference service provided by these academic libraries as a group. (1) A means for making comparisons and broader statements about quality was needed. After a 1999 study of e-marl reference pages on Association of Research Libraries (ARL) academic library Web sites, the author conducted an unobtrusive study of e-mail reference practice as performed by these libraries in early 2001. (2) The objectives of the 2001 study were to examine common characteristics of responses to e-mail reference queries, and to collect data on these characteristics as expressed in responses received from the reference service providers. Expectations for the state of e-marl reference service were: * Libraries would give all Web patrons a clear statement of their policies concerning e-mail reference service, and then meet or exceed the goals for service mentioned in those policies. * Libraries would provide more service to their affiliated patrons than to non-affiliates. * Reference service providers would extend accepted good practices for reference interviews into the e-mail environment. * Libraries would take advantage of technology to provide features not applicable to face-to-face or telephone reference situations. * Reference service providers would respond to clearly worded queries with direct answers, or with URLs of Web pages containing direct answers, and would answer with high levels of accuracy. …",,

We attempted to determine the correlation between the presence of postextrasystolic changes in the STU segment and a history of sustained ventricular arrhythmias. Background. Postextrasystolic U wave augmentation (a marled increment in U wave amplitude after premature ventricular complexes [PVCs]) is an adverse prognostic sign in the ""pause-dependent long QT syndrome."" However, the prevalence of postextrasystolic changes in patients without the long QT syndrome is unknown. Methods. We compared the configuration of the STU segment of the postextrasystolic heat (the sinus beat after a PVC) with the Snr configuration during sinus rhythm in three patient groups: 1) 41 patients with spontaneous ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) (VT/VF group), 2) 63 patients with heart disease and high grade ventricular arrhythmias (control group), and 3) 29 patients with high grade ventricular arrhythmias but no heart disease (reference group). Results. Postextrasystolic T wave changes did not correlate with a history of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, However, postextrasystolic U wave changes were more common among the patients with VT/VF than among control subjects (39% vs. 8.7%, p < 0,001), By logistic multiple regression analysis, a low left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.001) and postextrasystolic U wave changes (p < 0.005) were independent predictors of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Conclusions. Postextrasystolic T Have changes are common and lack predictive value, Postextrasystolic U wave changes may be a specific marker of a tendency to the development of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. Prospective studies should be performed to confirm this association. (C) 1996 by the American College of Cardiology",,

Cervarola Formation in the Bologna Apennines, between the Sillaand Setta streams. A number of distinctive geometrical, sedimentological and compositional characteristics allow the carbonate bodies to be interpreted as authigenic carbonate buildups (primary chemoherms), related to methane venting. Chemoherms are always located in proximity of the tectonic contact separating the M. Cervarola Fm from the Sestola-Vidiciatico Unit. In this context, the expulsion of fluids was probably induced by tectonic compression and the chemoherms could be considered as syn-tectonic deposits related to structural highs. Syntectonic highs affected the early-middle Miocene sedimentation of foredeep turbidite units (M. Cervarola and Marnoso-arenacea formations) with pelitic turbidites overlapping structural reliefs, probably related to blind thrusts-fold drapes. Chemoherms within the pelitic intervals could be used as indicators of tectonic activity, as confirmed by the associated chaotic structures and slumps. These observations, and the comparison with the resedimented chemoherms occurring in other outrops of the M. Cervarola Fm. as well as in minor basins (Porretta-Suviana), are crucial to more accurate paleogeographic reconstructions of the middle Miocene foredeep.",,

The sensitive preferred orientation of the phyllosilicates is considered as the main responsible of the fabric orientation due to external forces (e.g. those that produce deformation). A clear longitudinal tangential mechanism can be recognised in the hinges of the structure. Due to the synsedimentary growing of the anticline we propose a dynamical model to explain the results obtained at the syncline hinges. This model correlates well with the obtained data and allows us to differentiate the degree of deformation between the synclines that surround the study anticline. Furthermore an approach to the relationship between the differences of geometrical shortening and the degree of anisotropy (P′) can be fitted due to similarity between the magnetic and mechanical properties of the studied rocks and to the coaxiality between the initial fabric (sedimentary) and the overprinted one (tectonic).,,

All of these control factors were influenced by a major tectonic event represented by the rifting of the Cieszyn Basin. In its earliest history it acted as a gulf adjacent to the Eastern European Platform. The Tithonian marls and marly shales known in Polish regional geology as the lower Cieszyn shales and Cieszyn limestones yielded highly diverse calcareous benthic foraminiferal assemblages which are dominated by shallow and deep infaunal morphogroups. A remarkably well-developed epifaunal component can be recognized as well. Shelf and peri-reefal foraminifera originally developed their life cycles under well-oxygenated conditions in the immediate proximity of the sea-bottom. The initiation of turbidite sedimentation lead to the removal and transportation of shelf foraminifers into deeper water environments (bathyal). Consequently, the tests of calcareous foraminifers are small, and poorly preserved, presenting dissolution traces, and abraded and corroded surfaces. The mixed and reworked microfauna were replaced by a more uniform one in the proximity of the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary. Active omnivorous infauna survived not only the change of deposition system but also the deepening of the Cieszyn Basin during Early Cretaceous times. Periodically the supply of reworked and allochthonous calcareous benthic forms into the Cieszyn Basin took place during the Berriasian and Late Valanginian-Hauterivian times.",,

These promising shows, based on early appraisals, require thorough in depth investigations in terms of reservoir size, recoverable reserves, well deliverabilities in order to assess whether the resource could sustain feasible development issues for electricity production. The paper reviews the results of the preliminary reservoir simulation studies carried out for the area in question addressing reservoir evaluation: i.e. lateral extent, thickness and volume, tectonic features, governing boundary condtions, porosity/ permeability patterns, reservoir compartments and continuity between these compartments. INTRODUCTION The Pannonian Basin was formed as a result of a southward subduction of an oceanic lithosphere. The rising contact of the mantle with the crust resulted in crust thlnning by extension and erosion. This caused a Iugher than average heat flow in the region, due to the closer proximity to the hotter mantle. The subsidence which took place mainly the NeogeneQuaternary age. resulted in sedmentation of sandstones, clays and marl. The Pannonian formations overlie rocks of Mocene age or older. The latter are often referred to as basement and consist of both sedmentary and igneous rocks, includng limestones, dolomites, sandstones, conglomerates, as well as igneous and metamorphic rocks. The basement rocks are the main target of exploration for geothermal resources suitable for electricity production.

A.D. 1650 in the Allen phase. The landowner had collected artifacts on his farm and contacted the Texas Historical Commission (THC) about getting information about them, who in turn contacted the author, a member of the Texas Archeological Stewardship Network. The landowner was interested in learning more about the native inhabitants who had once called this portion of Stone Chimney Creek home. Stone Chimney Creek originates in northern Cherokee County and flows in a southerly direction before joining the Neches River under present day Lake Palestine. The study area is some 4.8 km north of the confluence of Stone Chimney Creek and the Neches River. Stone Chimney Creek, in the study area, is deeply entrenched with a narrow floodplain and steep valley walls. Therefore, in the study area, there are no good alluvial settings for archaeological sites. Rather, archaeological sites are located on upland slopes or on top of upland landforms paralleling Stone Chimney Creek. Some of the site settings are unusual, being at the head of dry drainages and gullies, as they are in the adjoining Flat Creek basin and long distances (in terms of easy access to water) from Stone Chimney Creek proper. The soils in the study area are of the Nacogdoches series, which are the principal red soils in the Redlands section of East Texas. The iron and red pigments in these soils permeate everything: skin, clothing, the outside of houses, even artifacts. Depending on the degree of slope, soil layers and fertility vary across the study area; the steeper slopes are heavily eroded. Parent material is greensand marl or glauconitic sandy clay and clay. Certain locations in the study area have been mined of soil for construction purposes. There is evidence of old farming activities, such as farming terraces, but currently large portions of the study area have been cleared and developed for pasture. This land clearing and mining provided good surface visibility at certain sites, resulting in some large surface collections from those areas. Shovel tests were conducted at six of the recorded sites and a 1 x 1 m test unit was placed in a midden deposit at 41CE426. This article characterizes the work to date on these Stone Chimney Creek sites, focusing mainly on five sites with the largest surface collections. The article concludes with a discussion of the broader character and cultural affiliation of these sites with respect to the recently defined Upper Neches River cluster of Historic Caddo sites.",,

The clays contained in the less than 2 ~tm fraction of the sediments are detrital phengites and illites, illite/smectites or smectites, and palygorskite. Due to the presence of well preserved long fibers, the palygorskite could not have been transported. They are authigenic and must have formed directly by precipitation from solutions rich in Mg and A1. The detrital illites are impoverished in K and tetrahedral AI. The illite/smectites or smectites, on the contrary, are K-rich but have a low tetrahedral charge. They are also richer in Mg and Fe and have a different crystal size, composition, and crystallinity from the illites. They most probably formed by crystallization, similar to the palygorskites, directly from the solution. The A1 could have been provided by the detrital illite, which may have been unstable in an alkaline environment and released K and A1 to the solutions. Key Words--AEM, Jbel Rhassoul, Neoformation, Palygorskite. I N T R O D U C T I O N The Tertiary lacustrine formation of the Jbel Rhassoul (Morocco) has great commercial interest because it is exploited for magnesian clays which are used as fuller's earth. In this work we are particularly interested in the fibrous clay, palygorskite, which is associated with other clays in the sediments of the ""Formation Rouge"" at the bottom of the Jbel Rhassoul mountain. This palygorskite has been previously identified (Trauth, 1977; Lucas and Prrvr t , 1976), but its origin has not been clarified. According to the literature, there are two mechanisms to generate palygorskites in surface conditions: 1) by neoformation (Weaver, 1984; Isphording, 1984; Esteoule-Choux, 1984; Singer, 1984); or 2) by transformation of another clay, such as illite (Galan and Castillo, 1982) or smectite (Singer, 1984). It is proposed in this work, first, to characterize structurally and chemically the palygorskites and associated clays in the Rhassoul formation by means of X-ray diffraction and AEM analyses; and second, to suggest a mechanism for their genesis. FIELD OCCURRENCE AND SAMPLE LOCATION The Jbel Rhassoul is a small mounta in in the Moulouya Valley, located at the East side of the Middle Atlas in Morocco (Figure 1). The Mio-Pliocene sediments of the Jbel Rhassoul have a lacustrine origin (Raynal, 1952; Trauth, 1977; Lucas and Prrvrt , 1976). An angular unconformity separates these sediments from the underlying Cretaceous formations. The ""Formation Rouge"" is composed of detrital material from the erosion of Jurassic to Cretaceous marine Copyright 9 1993, The Clay Minerals Society deposits. The sediments of the ""Formation Rouge"" interbedded with a chalky dolomite incrustation (Figure 2) are essentially marls and mudstones showing cross bedding, trough-cross bedding, and rill erosion features typical of a lacustrine delta (Lucas and Prrv6t, 1976). Five representative specimens (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) chosen for this study were obtained from different levels of the ""Formation Rouge"" (Figure 2). They contain days; dolomite; traces of celestite and quartz; and, in one case, gypsum (Table 1). The clay is quantitatively dominant.

In the Lower Cretaceous sandstones and marls of Gerecse Mts a corrensite-rich association could be derived from ophiolitic sources. In thick clastic detrital sequences of Paleogene and Neogene basins mixed-layer illite/smectites display diagenetic transition toward illite depending on depth, temperature, rate of subsidence and subsequent tectonism. In Pliocene and Quaternary basaltic craters of W Transdanubia bentonites consist of iron-rich beidellites. Red clays contain disordered kaolinite-bearing and a smectite(+vermiculite)-bearing units. At Visonta high charge beidellites were found. Paleontological and mineralogical records agree well in the fresh and paleosol layers of loess. In the clay fraction of Recent soils, chernozems are characterized by illite, brown forest soils, humic gleys and salt affected soils by more smectite-rich associations.",,

The group, comprising 650 m of well-bedded pelagic limestone, marl, and chert, consists of two formations: Mead Hill Formation (257 m) and Amuri Limestone (393 m). The latter includes five distinctive, informal units: Black Siltstone, Lower Limestone, Lower Marl, Upper Limestone, and Upper Marl. Muzzle Group is in fault contact with mid-Cretaceous (Clarence Series) Split Rock Formation siltstones at its base, and is unconformably overlain by Oligocene (Landon Series) Weka Pass Limestone. The Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary, within Mead Hill Formation, is marked by a distinct lithologic change from pale limestone to dark laminated mudstone grading up into a 23 m thick chert unit. Basal Paleocene biotas suggest a relatively complete boundary sequence, similar to that observed in coastal Marlborough. The Late Paleocene Black Siltstone unit, considered laterally equivalent to distinctive transgressive or highstand facies to the south and in North Island, forms the basal unit of Amuri Limestone. The overlying Lower Limestone is also Late Paleocene (late Teurian) at the base and Early Eocene (Waipawan to possibly Mangaorapan) in the upper part. The Lower Marl is Early Eocene, possibly as old as Waipawan, at the base, otherwise it is Mangaorapan to perhaps earliest Heretaungan. The Upper Limestone is early Middle Eocene based on Radiolaria; foraminifera and dinoflagellates have not been obtained from this highly indurated unit, but indirect evidence suggesting a Heretaungan-Porangan age is consistent with radiolarian results. All groups indicate a late Middle Eocene (Bortonian) age for the Upper Marl. Foraminifera indicate progressive transgression, with submergence from inner-mid shelf to mid-bathyal depths in the Cretaceous. Highly siliceous lithologies and an abundance of diatoms indicate a nutrient-rich upwelling setting. Significant shallowing, probably within the bathyal zone at the K-T boundary is inferred from an increase in total abundance of benthic foraminifera and greatly reduced numbers of planktics. An influx of spumellarian radiolarians, together with increases in diatom abundance and whole-rock silica content, indicate enhanced levels of siliceous plankton productivity, probably due to regional upwelling of cool, nutrient-rich waters in the earliest Paleocene. Benthic-dominated foraminiferal faunas indicate bathyal to outer shelf depths prevailed for most of the Paleocene, and planktic foraminifera only return to Cretaceous abundance levels in the latest Paleocene (Lower Limestone). Bathyal conditions are maintained throughout the remainder of the sequence. Upwelling appears to have declined progressively, with silica content and siliceous biota abundance reaching very low levels in Early-Middle Eocene (Lower to Upper Marl).",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/85/C0/C2/85C0C2B38061D5A7F6969833B960D96A.pdf

Microfossils are predominantly benthic foraminifera represented by 38 species, many of which are milioline and one is a larger form. A Borelis melo melo Local Range Zone of Early Miocene (Burdigalian) age was recognized.

The Dam Formation was stratigraphically subdivided into two new formal members. The basal Al-Kharrara Member is made up of limestone, marl, and claystone, and the overlying Al-Nakhash Member is a cyclic assemblage of carbonate, evaporite, and algal stromatolite facies. The lithofacies are grouped into four major types of which limestone, subdivided into six subfacies, is dominant. The Al-Kharrara was interpreted as having been deposited in warm (25°–30°C), clear, shallow waters of the inner neritic zone (0–35 m) that had an elevated salinity (35‰–50‰) and a vegetated substrate. The Al-Nakhash probably formed in an oscillating, very shallow-marine environment (0–10 m deep, including tidal flats), under warm climatic conditions that eventually led to the accumulation of evaporites and algal stromatolites.",,

The postmortem involved a review of the drilling experiences, the analysis of CAST image data, wireline log data and the LWD logs. This information was used to refine and verify a geomechanical model (in-situ stress, pore pressure and rock mechanical properties) in the vicinity of the Gnu-1 well. Of prime concern was the verification of the pre-drill pore pressure prediction previously undertaken using 3D seismic velocity data and offset well data. Wellbore failure and natural fracture analysis were an integral part of the postmortem. Wellbore breakouts seen in the image data allowed the pore pressure in the 8½"" hole section of Gnu-1 to be constrained. Modelling using image data collected in the Athol Formation indicates that the pore pressure does not increase as rapidly as was estimated in the pre-drill study. Pore pressures in the North Rankin Formation and below were consistent with the pre-drill study. The geomechanical model was able to explain the losses seen in the Athol Formation in Gnu-1 when using the mud weights experienced by the open hole at the time of drilling. Introduction The Gnu Prospect is situated in the northern portion of Block WA-209-P in the Dampier Sub-basin, Australian Northwest Shelf (Fig. 1). The prospect is located within the Reindeer Gas Field. A number of offset wells exist in the region, the closest wells being Reindeer-1, approximately 1.5 kilometres to the northeast, and Caribou-1, 2 kilometres to the southeast. Gnu-1 was designed as an exploration well. The anticipated overburden stratigraphy at the location of Gnu-1 consists of Tertiary and Upper Cretaceous carbonates, marls and siltstones that overlie Cretaceous claystones, siltstones and minor sandstones and greensands. The primary aim was to drill vertically to intersect the M.australis glauconitic sandstone and then to build angle and continue drilling a deviated hole through the main Reindeer Field gas appraisal location within the Legendre Formation and into the North Rankin, Brigadier and Mungaroo Formations (Ref. 1). The M.australis sandstones lie within a stratigraphic trap, formed due to restricted deposition and subsequent erosional truncation in the vicinity of the Reindeer Gas Field. The traps at other levels are structural closures. The Legendre Formation comprises blocky well developed sandstones which are anticipated to have similar porosities and permeabilities to those rocks seen within the Reindeer-1 and Caribou-1 and Caribou-1ST-1 wells. The purpose of drilling to specific depths within the North Rankin and Brigadier Formations was to test the potential of an additional structural closure. Both the North Rankin and Brigadier Formations were expected to contain hydrocarbons and also different degrees of overpressure. In fact, the main drilling hazard for the deeper targets was the overpressure which was expected to be encountered based on information obtained during the drilling of Caribou-1. The nearest well, Reindeer-1, did not drill deep enough to intersect these overpressured formations. The objectives of this paper are to show how geological and well engineering data from the exploration and appraisal wells in the Dampier Sub-basin were used to build a pre-drill geomechanical model for the Gnu Prospect to help in the design of the Gnu-1 well. The postmortem analysis shows the strengths and limitations of the pre-drill pore pressure from high quality 3D seismic velocity data. The analysis was subsequently verified and improved using observations of wellbore breakouts in image data to back calculate pore pressure in the shale. Geomechanical Approach A robust, field-specific geomechanical model (in-situ stress, pore pressure and rock mechanical properties) has proved to be an essential tool for the hydrocarbon industry (Ref. 2). This is because geomechanics has an impact on all aspects of field development from the initial exploration and appraisal stages to production and field abandonment. A properly optimised development plan incorporating geomechanics can result in large cost savings over a field's lifetime.",,

The lower part of the succession contains a turbidite interval comprising a number of distinct turbidite sequences. The turbidite sequences occur within or substitute entirely the laminite beds, so that turbidite deposition is similarly precession punctuated.The turbidite facies is characteristic for small, prograding fan lobes fed by small-volume turbidites. The abundant plant remains, the local palaeogeographic setting and the association with laminites (related to wet climate) suggest a river-fed submarine fan-lobe, where the timing of sediment transport is largely controlled by river floods during periods of high precipitation and continental run-off. The onset and ending of the turbidite interval is most likely finked with either autocyclic processes or by tectonic steepening of the hinterland relief.

The type section of the Wadi Bahloul comprises 29 m of sediment showing a regular repetition of an elementary depositional sequence including black, thinly-bedded limestones and bioturbated gray marls. These sedimentological fluctuations define two trophic states of the palaeoenvironment. The laminated black limestones are associated with eutrophic conditions in the water column above an anoxic basin, while oligotrophic and at least temporarily oxic conditions at the sediment/water interface prevailed during the deposition of the bioturbated grey marls. Each lithological cycle reflects short-term climatic fluctuations: arid conditions are associated with the deposition of the black laminated limestones, whereas the grey marls correspond to sub-humid conditions. These environmental changes are interpreted as being related to precession cycles of 20 ky. According to the number of precession cycles identified in the section of the type locality, the Bahloul Formation probably was deposited during one eccentricity cycle of 400 ky.

In the Campos Basin two main pre-salt source kitchens can be identified; an inboard graben which has sourced most of the hydrocarbons and an eastern outboard graben system. The presence and maturity of this latter graben system is essential for the success of the deepwater plays in the Campos and other Brazilian basins. Reverse post-rift subsidence modelling was employed to determine the thermal history of the basin to aid constraining predictions of source maturity. The risk in the outboard graben is that the thermal model required to produce a post-rift basin, with a shallow depositional environment for salt accumulation followed by a period of rapid subsidence associated with continental breakup, must involve a period of high heat flows. These are associated with extreme thinning of the lithosphere, either during or after deposition of the salt. This period of high heat flow is separate from the thermal event that produced the original rifting, indicating that the Pre-salt sources have been influenced by two periods of elevated heat flows during the initial rifting and subsequently during the later breakup event. Critically, modelling is required to determine the timing and extent of these events and their effects on the petroleum system. Post-salt subsidence results in further hydrocarbon generation from the pre-salt sources in the outboard grabens. Key risks are the timing and extent of this breakup related heat flow event: structural modelling in conjunction with basin modelling was used to assess the critical effects on maturation of the pre-salt source rocks. Structural modelling used an integrated approach of flexural backstripping (or reverse post- rift subsidence modelling) and section restoration to generate sequential snapshots of section geometry from the present day back to 112 Ma, the assumed age of continental breakup (Figure 1). The beta factor profile represents the degree of whole-lithosphere thinning associated with the breakup event. Beta factor magnitude is a proxy for mantle isothermal",,

Smith'}]","The Edwards aquifer of south-central Texas lies within, and adjacent to, the Balcones fault zone and is one of the most productive carbonate aquifers in the United States. The Trinity aquifer outcrops to the north of the Balcones fault zone and supplies baseflow to streams flowing south over the Edwards recharge zone. The geology of Edwards and Trinity aquifers consists of approximately 400 meters of Lower Cretaceous carbonates with interbedded marl and dolostone. Miocene age faults within the Balcones fault zone are en echelon, exhibiting primarily normal displacement, trending northeast and downthrown to the southeast. Numerous cross-faults oriented perpendicular to the primary faults trend to the southeast. In the Edwards aquifer, cross-faults breach relay ramps between overlapping faults, providing both a mechanical and hydrologic link between the primary faults. The fracturing within relay ramps and adjacent to the primary faults in the Edwards aquifer is quite variable, resulting in the development of circuitous and prolific ground-water flow paths. Because of the crystalline nature of the host rock and the susceptibility of the carbonate strata to karst formation, the enhancement of secondary porosity and permeability in fracture zones and fault planes is highly likely in both the Edwards and Trinity aquifers. Vertical displacement of the terrain from north to south by Balcones faults allows for steep hydraulic gradients to develop, maintaining high flow velocities of meteoric groundwater in the shallow sub-surface during recharge events. This process of karst formation resulting from the dissolution of fractures and enhancement of fracture zone permeability occurs primarily parallel to the down-dip direction, along high-angle cross-faults and fracture zones that trend nearly perpendicular to the regional ground-water flow direction. In both the Edwards and Trinity aquifers, a relation between fractures and faults and their susceptibility to dissolution by groundwater can often be observed in outcrop as recrystallized calcite or cavities filled with oxidized clays. Mapping in the Edwards and Trinity aquifer region in south-central Texas reveals a bimodal distribution of fracture zones and faults and corresponding cave passages oriented both parallel and nearly perpendicular to the northeast-trending, primary faults. The most well-developed caves and solution zones are not aligned with the major faults, but are oriented along the northwest to southeast trend of cross-faults and shorter fracture zones, that parallel the down-dip direction of the Balcones fault zone, and are nearly perpendicular to regional ground-water flow direction. The location and extent of most sensitive karst features in the region are unmapped and those that are have not been released to the public. However, the fracture zones and faults that influence the location and direction of secondary porosity development have been mapped; thus providing a representative surface expression of potential zones of karst enhanced fractures and highly developed cavern systems. Understanding the relation between these fracture zones/faults and the subsequent karst development can assist in the identification and quantification of high volume, high velocity ground-water flow paths in the Edwards and Trinity aquifers.",,

This paper briefly describes the abiotic boundary conditions at the artificial reef area in Nienhagen on the coast of the German Baltic Sea. This reef, the largest man-made reef in the Baltic Sea (about 4 ha), was built in autumn 2003 by the state research institute for agriculture and fisheries (LFA) in 12 m water depth. The artificial reef area in the Mecklenburg Bight was mainly constructed to enhance fish populations, especially for the commercially important Baltic cod population. Reef monitoring of abiotic factors (temperature, salinity, 02, pH) started in 2003 and is still in progress, complemented by sediment sampling. The reef rises from the seafloor, up to 3 m at the central structures and between 1 and 2 m in the outer regions. The reef units were chosen for their long life and high stability and for the creation of cavity systems and hideaways for juvenile organisms. The used concrete material was composed in a special way to reach neutral pH values, with regard to the surrounding waterbody, on the surfaces of the structures. The reef units were placed on a strong marl layer with a thin sediment layer of sand and gravel. The grain size distribution and sediment composition within the reef area has changed compared with the surrounding areas since the installation of the reef units.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/C7/50/89/C750894DCC6EF5867DD900DC23EAB53D.pdf

It has been applied to the pelagic, organic-rich and carbonate-dominated ""Marne a Fucoidi"" Formation in the Marche-Umbria Basin. The relationship between the natural radioactivity parameters (potassium, thorium and uranium) and the carbonate and organic contents has been analysed in a reference section. The potassium and thorium signals appear as very good indicators of the clay content, whereas the uranium signal is not as straightforward. The latter is influenced by the content in organic matter, the thickness of black shales and the type of rocks alternating with black shales (marls or carbonates). In marl-dominated rocks, the uranium curve is a good indicator of the organic-rich zones, whereas, in carbonate-dominated sediments, the signal is more subtle and zones with a higher organic content do not always appear as good log markers. The total gamma-ray signal is strongly influenced by the potassium and amplifies the effects of the clay content with respect to the organic matter. The validity of field gamma-ray investigations as a lithological and intra-basin correlation tool is confirmed by the excellent match between the total gamma-ray curve of the reference section, that from another field section and geophysical logs from a petroleum well. The precise correlation of field gamma-ray data with subsurface logs permits results from field studies (e.g., biostratigraphic boundaries) to be directly plotted onto the well data.",,

So there is, e.g., the ""diinple'Yomation, the high level of stab~lity (with respect to the bulk situation), the dipoldipole crystallization, layering effect in the electron mobility and so on, see Ref. [I]. A11 these phenomena are developed under the assumption that the solid substrate is flat. However, in reality solid surfaces are not perfect and the level of roughness is usually not small {the roughness amplitude IS comparable to the thickness of the helium film), So the question arises, how the 2D clectroil system on a thin helium film ""feels"" the random roughness of the substrate. A preliminary answer to this question is presented in Rcf. [ 2 ] . Using quite general assumptions 2D electron layers on t h ~ n hellurn films arc represented as a two-fraction system which leads to various consequences of the understanding of these electron layers [ 2 ] .

Larsen'}],"Early Pliocene marine marls from Il Trave Sud, located along the Adriatic coast of Italy, consist of rhythmic light-grey and dark-grey color variations. These variations have previously been interpreted as cycles of warm, wet, estuarine climates, and cool, dry, anti-estuarine climates, based on whole-rock carbon and oxygen stable isotope analysis, calcimetry, and magnetic susceptibility by Borkowski (2002). Milankovitch cycles of precession and obliquity were determined by to be the dominant driving forces behind these climate alterations. Proxies from marine sediments offer useful data for paleoenvironment interpretations. Planktonic and benthic foraminifera provide detailed analysis of paleoceanographic conditions due to their habitat in surface and deep water reservoirs. Carbon and oxygen isotope analysis from foraminifera are used to reconstruct paleoceanographic conditions including ocean circulation, biological marine productivity, precipitation-evaporation rates, salinity, global ice volume, and paleotemperatures. In this study, carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of Orbulina universa and Planulina wuellerstorfi from Il Trave Sud generally support and add to the model proposed by Borkowski (2002). A warm, wet, climate with a stratified water column consists of low surface water δO and CaCO3 content, high surface δ C, and high deep water δO and δC. A cool, dry climate with a vertically mixed water column was interpreted from high CaCO3 content, high surface δ O and δC, and low deep water δO and δC values. A third climate system was interpreted as a warm, wet climate with some ocean mixing. This climate contains low surface δO and δC values, high CaCO3 content, and low deep water δO and δC values due to mixing of the water column.",,

Introduction Study Objectives for location bypassed hydrocarbons in AlgyöField C/O logging began in 2003. The main objective was to determine the currentwater saturations and gas contacts in the Csongrad-Del-1 and Szo-1 reservoirsin twelve ALGYO field wells. A second objective was to locate bypassedhydrocarbons to aid in the planning and selection of drilling targets forsubsequent horizontal well drilling programs. A third objective was to enhancereservoir description through updated lithology identification. Finally, afourth objective was to monitor changes in the gas column in one crestal wellthrough time-lapse logging. These objectives were to be met with all production hardware in place, andwith minimal disruption in hydrocarbon production from the intervals belowthese logging campaign's zones of interest. Geological Environment of Algyo Field Until now, 76 reservoirs were explored, both saturated and undersaturatedoil and gas reservoirs can be found among them. The reservoirs situated in1500–2600 mss zone were formed on the compactional anticlinal of N-NW, S-SEdirection, were deposited on the structural basement. (Fig.1.) For more than 30years, the hydrocarbon production has come from four main geological intervals:Paleozoic, fractured metamorphic basement; Lower-Pannonian age basalticconglomerates above the basement; Lower-Pannonian turbiditic sandstones andUpper-Pannonian deltaic sandstones. The Lower-Pannonian age basalticconglomerates means mainly the Deszk gas formation nowadays for water disposal.It originally contained 20% of the gas reserves. The Lower-Pannonian productivezone consists of turbiditic sandstones and marls with low porosity andpermeability. The Alsopannon-13 reservoir which is the most important targetzone for horizontal sections and Alsopannon-14 gas reservoir are in thiszone.",,

The Betic Belts consist of an internal metamorphosed part and an external sedimentary zone containing the Triassic deposits, with the latter seam being in turn divided into the Prebetic Zone with continental to shallow marine facies and the Subbetic Zone with pelagic facies. The Buntsandstein-facies red bed series is vertically split into three main facies associations: alluvial fans and pebbly braided rivers (conglomerates and sandstones), low-sinuosity proximal and distal sandy braided rivers (sandstones and mudstones) and coastal evaporitic sabkha (mudstones, marls and gypsum). Alluvial-fan and pebbly braided river sediments occur at the base of the sequence and cover the palaeorelief of the pre-Triassic morphology. The inner fan zone is characterized by debris-flows or mud-flows, the mid fan zone is dominated by sheet floods, and the outer fan zone is governed by stream flood and stream flow passing into pebbly braided rivers in front of the fans. With transition from restricted alluvial fans to an open braidplain, the pebbly rivers soon evolve both vertically and horizontally into sandy stream networks consisting of channels and floodplains. The channel facies comprises sheet-type and ribbon-type sandstone layers. The sheets form complexes up to 15 m and more thickness due to amalgamation by multilateral coalescence and multivertical stacking of individual genetical units. In the lower part of the series, the number of channels is rather high suggesting a non-hierarchical channel pattern where high- and low-sinuosity rivers coexist. The middle portion reflects a smaller number of very large channels thus indicating an amelioration of the hierarchical pattern. The upper part consists of variegated sabkha plain mudstones and evaporites where channel deposits are almost absent. The floodplain facies is divided into proximal and distal part. The proximal floodplain facies comprises interbedded sandstones and mudstones containing some layers of nodular pedogenic carbonates and originates by overbank sheet-flood, levee overtopping and crevasse-splay sedimentation. The distal floodplain facies is built up of mud with minor layers of silt and fine sand with intercalations of micritic lacustrine limestones and originates in overbank lakes and ponds. Depositional sequences within the sandy braided river series comprise major sequences that are produced by migration of alluvial subenvironments during course of their aggradation, and minor sequences that are related to alternating high- and low-water stages with changing channel abandonment and stream neoformation. The fluvial architecture is highlighted by two types of depositional settings: proximal and distal facies. The proximal facies is characterized by predominantly straight channels without or with only poorly-developed levees and being infilled with sediments under rather high-energy conditions. The distal facies is characterized by low-sinuosity channels surrounded by better developed levees and being infilled under lower energy conditions than the proximal equivalents. With passage from the proximal to the distal facies, the floodplain sediments consist of increasingly more backswamp, levee and crevasse-splay deposits as well as of sediments of small meandering channels operating in the overbank plain between the large main streams. The evaporitic complex at the top of the Triassic originates in an arid coastal intertidal belt and supratidal sabkha seam. Within the sandy braided river complexes, the different magnitudes and effectivities of currents in large channels, small watercourses and floodplain reaches are underlined by partially divergent, bimodal or even bipolar palaeocurrent directions. Copper mineralizations of mixed syngenetic and epigenetic type in the terrestrial red beds are associated with plant debris in sediments of inactive to abandoned secondary channels and comprise azurite, chrysocolla and malachite. The Triassic palaeogeographical setting represents a large bay between the European and African plates. Fluvio-lacustrine red beds of Buntsandstein facies surrounded the bay and graded laterally into coastal and shallow marine carbonates.",,

Abstract. TRILOBITESFROMTHE VOLCANCITO FORMATION (FILO AZUL MEMBER, LATE CAMBRIAN) OFTHE FAMATINA SYSTEM, LA RIOJA, ARGENTINA: SYSTEMATICSANDPALEOENVIRONMENTS. The Filo Azul Member of the Volcancito Formation (Famatina range, La Rioja, Argentina) consists of a lower part (30 m) of thinly laminated marls and calcareous shales with intercalations of fine-grained sandstones, a middle part (85 m) of massive middle to thick-grained calcareous sandstones, and an upper part (50 m) of shales with interbedded layers of fine sandstones. Previous studies on trilobites, graptolites and conodonts assigned the section to the Upper Cambrian-Lower Ordovician. The lower portion of the member (Parabolina frequens argentina Biozone, lower part) contains a diverse trilobite fauna that was studied by Harrington and Leanza in the 1950s. Since then, new collections have been obtained, which are the subject of the present study. New polymerid trilobites, originally described on the basis of scarce material, are re-illustrated (Onychopyge riojana Harrington, Asaphellus riojanus Harrington and Leanza, Rhadinopleura eurycephala Harrington and Leanza, Plicatolina scalpta Harrington and Leanza) and the assignations of several taxa are reconsidered (Angelina cf. hyeronimi (Kayser), Parabolinella sp. 1, Parabolinella sp. 2, Pseudokainella tosellii sp. nov., Conophrys sp.)

On the other hand, the occurrence of Parabolina (Neoparabolina) frequens (Barrande) permits the outcrop to be correlated with other Upper Cambrian sections. The abundance of nutrients in the sea bottom must have favoured the development of a diverse trilobite community, which included different morphotypes and feeding habits. Several taxa were especially adapted to live under low-oxygen conditions, probably in symbiosis with sulfur bacteria.",,

In the study area, the Gessoso-Solfifera Fm is characterized by sulfate evaporites correlated to the Lower Evaporites in Sicily (DECIMA & WEZEL, 1971, 1973; MCKENZIE, 1985; DECIMA et alii, 1988) and to the Vena del Gesso in the northern Apennines (VAI & RICCI LUCCHI, 1977; ROVERI et alii, 2001; 2003; 2004). Above the Messinian evaporites, brownish marls, micritic- and brecciated-lime-stones rest unconformably on an erosional surface (the intra-Messinian unconformity). The NRD measurements have been carried out in three quarry-sections: 1) the Buzzi-Unicem (Trovigliano); 2) the Lafargessi (Trovigliano); 3) the Colle di Votta (Abbateggio). Combining the stratigraphy of these different sections, a composite stratigraphic column, which starts from the pre-evaporitic euxinic shales and up to the base of the post-evaporitic deposits, can be reconstructed. For each quarry-sections, the field gamma-ray profile has been obtained with a 20 cm regularly-spaced measurement of the gamma ray emission. Field NRD measurements and spectral acquisition have been clone by using the portable spectrometer «Rainbow 7010 MCA», equipped with a gamma scintillator having a Nal (T1) 2x2 crystal as detector. Different NRD values, in terms both of count per second (Cps) measured in the field and of U ppm , Th ppm , % K 2 O from laboratory analyses, allow us to recognize some NRD facies, which correspond to the main lithofacies within the Messinian deposits of the Maiella Mts. In terms of NRD values we have been able in distinguish the following facies (fig. 8): a) limestone - 20 Cps, 2.58 U ppm , 0.33 Th ppm , 1.01 % K 2 O; b) massive selenite with carbonate -11.1 Cps, 0.74 U ppm , no detectable Th ppm , 0.38 % K 2 O; c) massive selenite - 7.13 Cps, 0.30 U ppm , no delectable Th ppm , 0.40 % K 2 O; d) giant selenite. - 6.95 Cps, 0.07 U ppm , 0.08 Th ppm , 0.33 % K 2 O; e) euxinic shale - 49 Cps, 4.76 U ppm , 1.19 Th ppm , 13.48 % K 2 O; f) sapropel - 33 Cps, 1.04 U ppm , 1.52 Th ppm , 18.57 % K 2 O; g) branching selenite - 8.3 Cps, 0.52 U ppm , 0.11 Th ppm , 1.16 % K 2 O; h) gypsarenites - 9.1 Cps, 0.88 U ppm , 0.19 Th ppm , 1.16 % K 2 O; i) fine laminated gypsarenties - 10.3 Cps, 0.95 U ppm , 0.43 Th ppm , 5.43 % K 2 O; l) brecciated limestone - 42 Cps, 5.29 U ppm , 0.21 Th ppm , 0.89 % K 2 O. In the gamma-ray profiles (figs. 5, 6 and 7), the NRD signal allows us to distinguish each evaporitic cycle, characterized by low values of radioactivity, separated by sapropel horizons that show high gamma-ray emission. The gamma-ray profile of Colle di Votta section allows us to distinguish the Messinian evaporitic succession from the lower portion of the post-evaporitic Messinian deposits. In fact, the evaporitic and post-evaporitic Messinian deposits are characterized by different background values of the gamma-ray profile, which are about 10 Cps and 20-30 Cps, respectively. In terms of Th ppm /U ppm ratio, the main lithofacies of the Gessoso-Solfifera Fm show different values (tab. 1 and fig. 9b). Generally, sapropel are characterized by Th ppm /U ppm ≥ 1. On the contrary, limestones and gypsum deposits are characterized by values of Th ppm /U ppm <<1. These differences in the Th ppm /U ppm ratio could be related to changes in the detrital input into the sedimentary basin. In this frame, values of Th ppm /U ppm <<1 could he referred to decrease in the input if extra-hasinal detrital grains and to the formation of authigenic U-minerals (ADAMS & WEAVER, 1958). On the contrary, Th ppm /U ppm ≥ 1 could correspond to an increase in the input of detrital grains into the sedimentary basin. Changing of the Th ppm /U ppm ratio in the stratigraphic section could also indicate alternation between humid (Th ppm /U ppm ≥ 1) and arid (Th ppm /U ppm <<1) conditions. In conclusion, NRD analyses could supply information about several parameters connected with the evolution of sedimentary basin, such as: abundance of organic matter, redox condition, detrital input, climatic changes, etc. Thus, NRD field and laboratory investigations on stratigraphic sections could be a useful tool for basin analysis.",,

Silicon optical platform applications, where a laser diode is aligned to a single mode fiber or an optical waveguide, then soldered to a substrate, require post-bonding alignments better than 1 um for optimum device performance.Several methods have been investigated to meet such stringent alignment requirements, ranging from active alignment of a powered device to various forms of passive self-aligned soldering methods employing one or more mechanical stops. Though these methods have demonstrated some good results, the active alignment method incurs substantial cost of assembly time, while some self-aligning methods carry the disadvantage of requiring additional process steps during chip and substrate fabrication, as well as generating more sporadic alignment results under typical manufacturing variations.A fresh approach to this alignment problem is proposed, where the mechanical alignment and placement burdens are borne by the robotic placement machine. Differing substantially from pick and place machines available on the marl;et today, this new flip chip bonder has been specifically aimed at the special requirements of the optoelectronic module market.

For a comprehensive proteome analysis, multidimensional separation strategies are necessary. Online two-dimensional liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) combining strong cation exchange (SCX) in the first dimension with reversed-phase (RP) chromatography in the second dimension provides a powerful approach to analyze complex proteomes. Although the combination of SCX with RP chromatography provides a good orthogonality, only a moderate separation is achieved in the first dimension for peptides with two (+2) or three (+3) positive charges. The aim of this study was to improve the performance of online SCX-RP-MS/ MS by applying displacement chromatography to the first separation dimension. Compared to gradient chromatography mode (GCM), displacement chromatography mode (DCM) was expected to improve the separation of +2-peptides and +3-peptides, thus reducing complexity and increasing ionization and detectability. The results show that DCM provided a separation of +2-peptides and +3-peptides in remarkably sharp zones with a low degree of coelution, thus providing fractions with significantly higher purities compared to GCM. In particular, +2peptides were separated over several fractions, which was not possible to achieve in GCM. The better separation in DCM resulted in a higher reproducibility and significantly higher identification rates for both peptides and proteins including a 2.6fold increase for +2-peptides. The higher number of identified peptides in DCM resulted in significantly higher protein sequence coverages and a considerably higher number of unique peptides per protein. Compared to conventionally used saltbased GCM, DCM increased the performance of online SCX-RP-MS/MS and enabled comprehensive proteome profiling in the low microgram range. D recent technological advances in mass spectrometry, which have led to increased speed, sensitivity, resolution, and mass accuracy, the complexity of mammalian proteomes remains a major challenge in bottom-up proteomics. Although high proteome coverages can be obtained with onedimensional liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis using reversed-phase (RP) ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and modern high resolution orbitrap and Q-TOF instruments, deep proteome profiling requires multiple dimensions of separation. Two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) separation is most often used with low pH RP chromatography directly coupled to MS analysis in the second dimension. For the first separation dimension, several techniques exist such as high pH RP chromatography, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), and strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography. Multidimensional peptide separation methods can be used either offline or online, having their own advantages and disadvantages. Offline separation strategies offer a higher degree of freedom in optimizing parameters for each separation Received: May 16, 2018 Accepted: July 17, 2018 Published: July 17, 2018 Article pubs.acs.org/ac Cite This: Anal.

In addition, fractions collected in the first dimension can be reanalyzed and sample size can be reduced by combining different fractions. Online approaches are more easily automatable, offer an improved recovery, and reduce sample losses and contamination. One of these online approaches is the multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) pioneered by Yates and coworkers, which combined SCX with RP-LC-MS/MS analysis and became the template for many online 2D-LC-MS/ MS approaches. In conventionally used online SCX-RP-MS/ MS, the peptides are first loaded onto a SCX column, where they bind to the SCX material via electrostatic interactions. The peptides are usually eluted from the SCX column onto the RP column by injecting increasing concentrations of a volatile salt. In between the salt injections, the peptides are separated by an ACN gradient applied to the RP column and analyzed by tandemmass spectrometry. The SCX-RP-LC-MS/MS approach is the most frequently applied online 2D-LC-MS/MS approach in bottom-up proteomics. Under the acidic condition of the eluent with formic acid as an additive, which is mainly used for conventional online SCX-RP-MS/MS analysis, most tryptic peptides are doubly positive charged (+2). One charge is based on a basic residue such as lysine or arginine at the C-terminus. The second charge is due to the N-terminal amino group. Tryptic peptides with a three (+3) or even a higher number of positive charges are expected due to internal histidine, lysine, or arginine residues. The combination of SCX with RP chromatography provides a good orthogonality but only a moderate separation efficiency for tryptic peptides in the first dimension (SCX) because peptides with two (+2) and three (+3) positive charges tend to elute in clusters. In the early 1940s, Tiselius defined an alternative chromatographymode called displacement chromatography (DC). DC is based on competitive binding of the components themselves and the displacer molecule. First, the column is equilibrated with a carrier solution that is also used as the sample application buffer. The carrier solution must support a high binding affinity for the analytes toward the stationary phase. During sample loading, the analytes arrange themselves according to their affinity in a process described as sample self-displacement. The analyte with the highest affinity toward the stationary phase is binding to the chromatographic material at the top of the column, displacing analytes with lower affinities from their binding sites. Compared to conventionally used gradient chromatography (GC), 50−100% of the column binding capacity is used for sample loading in DC. The analytes are eluted in DC by loading a molecule onto the column called “displacer”, which is usually dissolved in the carrier solution. It is mandatory that the displacer has a very high affinity toward the stationary phase. Ideally, the displacer has a higher affinity toward the stationary phase than any of the sample analytes. Upon adsorption of the displacer to the stationary phase, it displaces the analyte with the highest affinity bound to the top of the column. Each displaced analyte itself acts as a displacer for the adjacent analyte with a lower affinity toward the column. This leads to the formation of a “displacement train”. In a displacement train, the analytes move down the column in a system of contiguous zones with rectangular shapes. The zones will keep their rectangular shape even if mass transfer resistances and slight kinetic or flow misdistributions are present, while these effects are responsible for bandspreading in elution chromatography. The self-sharpening effect of the boundaries between the zones during the displacement process increases the effectiveness of the separation. Provided the column is sufficiently long and the analytes are present in sufficient quantities, each zone contains only one analyte in a high purity. Thus, displacement chromatography mode (DCM) offers several advantages for peptide separation in SCX such as an improved separation of peptides in accordance to their charge state compared to gradient chromatography mode. However, DCM has been so far only applied to proteomics in a few cases. The aim of this study was to investigate whether DCMapplied to the first separation dimension improves the performance of online SCX-RP-MS/MS compared to conventionally used GCM due to a better separation of peptides according to their charge states. ■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION A detailed description of the materials and methods used for this study is included in the Supporting Information, whereas concise descriptions of the materials and methods are presented below. Online SCX-RP-MS/MS Setup. An OPTI-PAK SCX trap column (5 μm particle size, 120 nL bed volume, Dichrome, Marl, Germany) was used for the online SCX-RP-MS/MS analysis. The SCX trap column was installed directly behind the injection valve (nanoACQUITY, Waters, Manchester, UK) or the autosampler valve (UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano, Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) (Figure S-1). The SCX trap column was connected to a RP trapping and a RP separation column that was directly coupled to a ESI-Q-TOF (Q-TOF Premier, Micromass/Waters, Manchester, UK) or a ESI-Q-IT-OT (Orbitrap Fusion, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). A detailed description of the online SCXRP-MS/MS setup is included in the Supporting Information. Determination of SCX Binding Capacity and Displacer Pulses. Binding capacity of the SCX trap column was determined by repeated injections of 400 ng tryptic peptides (HeLa digest, c = 1 μg/μL, 0.1% FA dissolved in HPLC-H2O, buffer A). Peptides were loaded on the SCX column with a flowrate of 3 μL/min with 2% buffer B (0.1% FA, dissolved in ACN) and separated in the second dimension by RP chromatography using a linear gradient from 2 to 30% buffer B in 30 min (300 nL/min). Peptides were analyzed by ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS as described in the Supporting Information. Displacer pulses were determined by loading 5 μg of tryptic peptides (tryptic HeLa digest, c = 1 μg/μL, dissolved in buffer A) on the SCX column (2% buffer B, 3 μL/min). Peptides were elut",,

Both basins contain an early fill of Miocene carbonates including reef limestones. Messinian extension, oriented ENE-WSW, produced the asymmetrically faulted Polls graben structure. Evaporites were deposited in the south of the area while unconformity surfaces developed in the north. Pliocene marls and chalks were then deposited in a relatively quiescent phase in the north of the graben, while faulting continued into the Early Pliocene in the south. Plio-Pleistocene to Recent sediments record regional uplift of Cyprus. Contemporaneous NNE-SSW-oriented extension formed the Pegia half-graben and renewed minor faulting in the Polls graben. The extensional structures of the Polls graben system are thought to result from extension above a subduction zone located south of Cyprus, driven by subduction 'roll-back' and trench migration. Accelerated convergence and rapid roll-back during Late Miocene times caused the first stage of extension, whilst the Plio-Pleistocene faulting was driven by differential extension in the overriding plate as the Eratosthenes Seamount collided with the trench and locally impeded subduction. The Polls graben system may provide a model for the early stages of development of major supra-subduction zone extensional areas such as the Aegean region.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/0A/7A/F0/0A7AF0499083B66496CA0A1946EEB66E.pdf

Frontal parts of the nappe are diagenetic (Tmax <200°C) whereas rear parts both in the normal and inverted limb are epizonal (Tmax >300°C). We demonstrate that the calcite content of shales, marls or limestones has no influence on the average IC. Deviations of individual samples from the mean IC of any given diagenetic and lower anchizonal site are very large, however, without it being possible to associate deviations with any obvious rock parameter. The standard deviations of populations of IC values decrease strongly with increasing metamorphic grade (toward smaller IC values).

With falling sea level, the oyster Lopha villei colonized bathymetric highs in the shallow shelfal environments in east-central Jordan during the uppermost Campanian-Lower Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous). The oyster bioherms in the epeiric southern shelf of the Tethys formed small basins several hundreds of meters across and about 40-50 m deep. Under these lowstand conditions, oyster shells were shed off the bioherms and deposited as large cross bedded units on the flanks of the basins, At the same time, precursor phosphatic sediments were reworked and winnowed to form high-grade phosphorite sand. More than 250 million metric tons (250 x 10(9) kilograms) of phosphorite sand were deposited basinward of the oyster beds. As sea level continued to fall, the oyster bioherms formed partially silled basins with low biological diversity in which marl and/or bituminous marl was deposited.

The
 combined petrographic/isotopic/stratigraphic investigations of the dolomite succession in the studied area reveal the presence
 of two distinct dolomite types: dolomite type (I) is confined to the basal part of the succession being associated with economic
 ferro-manganese deposits, and dolomite type (II) is located near the upper part of the succession. Silt, clay and marl beds
 vertically separate the two dolomitic units.
 
 The dominance of ooid and benthic fossil ghosts in the basal dolomite type (I) supports the suggestion that the CaCO3 precursor has been formed under shallow agitated subtidal setting. The terrigenous beds that overlie this basal unit indicate
 that that the area has been brought into a meteoric realm during a subsequent lowstand period even before the emplacement
 of the upper part of the formation. During this period considerable stabilization of the initial metastable CaCO3 phases into diagenetic low-Mg calcites has presumably took place.
 
 
 
 The persistent stratigraphic distribution of dolomite type (II) throughout the entire area and the typical marine δ13C values (+1.1 and 2.9‰ PDB) are consistent with platform-wide pumping system within a subtidal setting. Early stabilization
 of the initial CaCO3 fabrics of the basal carbonate unit impeded their dolomitization during this stage. Subsequent shallow burial stabilization
 of dolomite type (II) is assessed from the well-developed stylolites, the non-planar crystal boundaries, the undulose extinction,
 the low porosity and the relatively depleted δ18O (−5.1 to −7‰ PDB) values. The initiation of dolomite type (I) was a post-burial process as indicated from the euhedral planar
 crystal boundaries, the high intercrystalline porosity and the absence of any compaction fabrics. The oxygen (3.3 to 4.7‰
 PDB) and carbon (+1.9 to 3.4‰ PDB) isotopic values of this type of dolomite are possibly inherited from the CaCO3 precursor where dolomitization took place from more or less unmodified marine water during period of minimum sea level fluctuations.",,

After a period of no diatom occurrence (the Coscinodiscus gigas var. diorama Zone is missing), the Middle Episode is defined by the Craspedodiscus coscinodiscus and the Actinocyclus moronensis Zones and covers the late Serravallian-early Tortonian. The Upper Episode corresponds to the Thalassiosira yabei Zone and is assigned to the middle Tortonian. The diatomaceous marls are comprised of opal A (10–85%) (mainly diatoms), calcite (5–80%) (principally foraminifers and nannoplakton), clay minerals (5–40%) and terrigenous quartz (<15%). The proportions of dilutants in diatomaceous sediments (biogenic calcareous, terrigenous and clay minerals), vary among the three episodes, reflecting their genesis and paleogeographic context. The beds containing the highest amounts of biogenic silica (opal A) and the lowest of biogenic calcite, located in the Middle and Upper Episodes, are the diatomaceous sediments formed under the most vigorous upwelling. The Upper Episode, where the clay and terrigenous dilutants predominate over calcareous dilutants, is interpreted as having been formed in an environment closer to the shore than the other episodes. The narrowing of the North Betic Strait from the Langhian to the Tortonian could have given rise to the progressive intensification of the upwelling.",,

Q7-forming Candida species were divided into three major groups (Group I, II, and III) and were phylogenetically distant from a group that includes the type species of the genus Candida. Group I included four clusters with basal branches that were weakly supported. The first cluster comprised C. vartiovaarae, C. maritima, C. utilis, C. freyschussil, C. odintsovae, C. melinil, C. quercuum, Williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, and W. mucosa. The second cluster comprised C. norvegica, C. montana, C. stellimalicola, C. solani, C. berthetii, and C. dendrica. Williopsis pratensis, W. californica, Pichia opuntiae and 2 related species, P. amethionina (two varieties), and P caribaea were also included in this cluster. The third cluster comprised C. pelliculosa (anamorph of P. anomala), C. nitrativorans, and C. silvicultrix. The fourth cluster comprised C. wickerhamii and C. peltata, which were placed in the P. holstii-C. ernobii clade with Q8-containing species. Group II comprised C. pignaliae, C. nemodendra, C. methanolovescens, C. marls, C. sonorensis, C. pini, C. lianquihuensis, C. cariosilignicola, C. ovalis, C. succiphila (including its two synonyms), C. methanosorbosa, C. nitratophila, C. nanaspora, C. boidinii (including its two synonyms), W. salicorniae, and P. methanolica. Group III was composed of four clusters with strong bootstrap support. The first cluster comprised C. valida (anamorph of P. membranifaciens), C. ethanolica, C. pseudolambica, C. citrea, C. inconspicua, C. norvegensis, C. rugopelliculosa, and C. lambica. Three species and two varieties of the genus Issatchenkla were also included in this cluster. The second cluster comprised C. diversa, C. silvae, 4 Saturnispora species, and P. besseyi. The third comprised C. sorboxylosa, and the fourth comprised C. vini. Based on this 18S rDNA sequence analysis, it is evident that Q7-forming Candida species and the genera Pichia and Williopsis are polyphyletic. The genus Issatchenkla is suggested to be congeneric with the genus Pichia. The genus Saturnispora is phylogenetically definable.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/A6/CF/B0/A6CFB0A75386C4C1D09B8F75FA42AE1B.pdf

This species is restricted to specialized habitats in a narrow upper-intertidal to lower-supratidal zone of salt marshes and thus particularly sensitive to environmental degradation through land reclamation and other human activities. Here, we first report the genetic diversity and population structure of E. chinense in Japan to evaluate the connectivity and conservation value of its local populations. Specimens were collected from seven localities (Tsu, Okayama, Yamaguchi, Usa, 'marl, Saga and Izumi) that cover the species' present distribution in the country. Analyses of 612-bp sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene showed high genetic diversity within populations and a reasonable level of connectivity among populations. However, significant genetic differentiation was detected among distant geographic regions in Japan and South Korea, due potentially to the disjunct distribution of habitable salt marshes and a short pelagic larval period of the species. The population of the Ise-Mikawa Bay area, representing the eastern limit of the current distribution range, showed the highest level of genetic differentiation and deserve particular conservation efforts to avoid local extinction, which occurred in Tokyo Bay area in the last century.",,

One such unit is the Coniacian-Santonian Matulla Formation exposed at Wadi Sudr, western Sinai. It is a fossiliferous and argillaceous limestone, marl, shale and sandstone about I 10 m thick. The oysters Pycnodonte (Costeina) costei (COQUAND, 1869) and Oscillopha dichotoma (BAYLE, 1849) are abundant in the middle (Coniacian) and upper (Santonian) members of this formation, respectively. Biostratigraphically, they represent the most characteristic index oyster species for the Coniacian-Santonian formations of Egypt. Their palaeobiogeographic distribution confirms the strong affinity to the Mediterranean Province of the Tethyan Realm. Taphonomic observations indicate that abrasion and highly fragmented shells are generally lacking. However, the thick shells of P (C.) costei and O. dichotoma at Wadi Sudr are highly altered by disarticulation, encrustation and bioerosion. The common encrusters include ostreids, cheilostome bryozoans, serpulid worms, foraminifera and plicatulid bivalves. Bioerosion structures include Tiers D, E, E G and H. They are represented by traces of acrothoracican cirripeds (Rogerella), clionaid sponge (Entobia), bivalves (Gastrochaenolites) and polychaetes and/or sipunculans (Maeandropolydora, Trypanites and Caulostrepsis). The distribution and frequency of the observed taphonomic features are varied greatly between the studied shells of both species, as well as within the shells of the same species.

Biomarker and diamondoid distributions as well as stable carbon isotope analysis on selected samples were determined by GC-MS and Finnigan Delta Plus mass spectrometer, respectively. Two active petroleum systems were identified in the region. A Jurassic petroleum system charged Nargesi oilfield, whereas the seeps appear to be charged by an older petroleum system. Higher maturity of seep samples identified by methylnaphthalenes, trisnorhopanes, and triaromatic steroid ratios implied that the second petroleum system should be older than Jurassic. Biomarker ratios confirmed that Marl-Carbonate source rocks deposited under anoxic to dysoxic conditions in open marine environment were the main oil-generating facies for the oilfield. Diamondoid indexes further support the concept developed by biomarker data and reveal that the seeps should be probably charged by shaly source rock.

Yu. Korolyuk'}, {'name': 'L. M. Abramova'}, {'name': 'N. a. Dulepova'}]","The results of long-term studies of the vegetation of chalk outcrops of the Orenburg region (Russian Federation) and North-West Kazakhstan on Sub-Ural plateau and adjacent territories are presented. Chalk outcrops are unique botanical-geographical sites located in steppe and desert zones of Eurasia. Specific communities of calcephyte plant species have spread in these areas, in places of outcrops or close occurrence from the surface of upper-Cretaceous carbonate rocks. The flora of chalk outcrops is characterized by a great amount of rare species, mainly ende­mic, associated with peculiar substrates, the locality of habitats, and the historical past of the area of outcrops location (Matyshenko, 1985) The history of the study of flora and vegetation of chalk outcrops is given. Synthaxonomic studies of chalk vegetation as part of the ecological-floristic approach cover only territories west of the Volga river (Poluyanov, 2009; Averinova, 2011, 2016; Demina, 2014; Demina et al., 2016; Didukh et al., 2018). Chalk highlands of the North-West Kazakhstan and adjacent regions of the Russian Federation occupy quite large areas. However, up to date, there is no data on the vegetation diversity of these territories based on complete geobotanical relevés, that is why their synthaxonomy remains undeveloped. The study area with 15 massifs of chalk outcrops (Fig. 1) includes the Orenburg region (Novosergievsky, Perevolotsky, Sol-Iletskiy, Akbulak and Gaysky districts), and Aktobe (Hobdinsky, Uilsky and Bayganinsky district) and Atyrau (Zhylyoysky district) regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The largest massifs in the Orenburg region of the Russian Federation are: Starobelogorskie (Fig. 2), Chesnokov­skie (Fig. 3), Verkhnechibendinskie (Fig. 6), Troits­kie (Fig. 7), Pokrovskie Chalk Mountains (Fig. 4) and Durtel mountain (Fig. 5). Chalk massif Akshatau (Fig. 8) and the range Aktolagai (Fig. 9) are the largest within Aktobe region. The investigated sites are mostly located on the Sub-Ural Plateau, which extended from the southern regions of the Orenburg region to the Emba River in the territory of Aktobe region. They are less common within the Obschiy Syrt and sporadic in the Guberlinskie mountains. The study area covers a wide range of zonal vegetation from dry steppes in the northern part of the gradient to northern deserts in the southern one. The dataset includes 270 relevés of chalk outcrops communities performed by the authors in 2014–2019. The primary classification was carried out using TWINSPAN algorithm. As a result three groups of communities are established. The first group is communities of the Emben Plateau, the most southern area; second is communities on relatively developed soils in the slopes bases, depressions between chalk ridges and on their flat tops; third is widespread communities on most of the Podural Plateau and Obschy Syrt, excluding the Emben Plateau. Comparison with associations of calcephyte, semidesert and steppe vegetation (Golub, 1994; Kolomiychuk, Vynokurov, 2016; Lysenko, Yamalov, 2017; Didukh et al., 2018; Korolyuk, 2017) was made to determine the position of studied communities in the system of ecological-floristic classification of the herbasceous vegetation of Eurasia. Cluster analysis results (Fig. 10) revealed the significant specificity the chalk outcrops of the Sub-Ural Plateau in comparison with calciphytic communities of Eastern Europe, as well as with deserts and steppes zonal vegetation. That was the reason to describe a new class for vegetation of the studied chalk outcrops. The class Anabasietea cretaceae Golovanov class nov. hoc loco. Diagnostic species: Anabasis cretacea, Anthemis trotzkiana, Artemisia salsoloides, Atraphaxis decipiens,Crambe aspera, Echinops meyeri, Jurinea kirghisorum, Hedysarum tscherkassovae, Lepidium meyeri, Limonium cretaceum, Linaria cretacea, Matthiola fragrans, Nanophyton erinaceum, Seseli glabratum, Zygophyllum pinnatum;holotypus is order Anabasie­talia cretaceae ord. nov. hoc loco. Class combines calciphytic, mainly semi-shrub communities on the outcrops of chalk and marl rocks of the south of the Orenburg region and North-West Kazakhstan within the steppe (subzones of the true and desert steppes) and desert zone. The central order, Anabasietalia cretaceae Golovanov ord. nov. hoc loco, is described;holotypus is alliance Anthemido trotzkianae–Artemision salsoloidis all. nov. hoc loco. Three alliances identified within the order reflect both community distribution along the latitudinal gradient and succession stages.

In the study area, the Gessoso-Solfifera Fin is characterized by sulfate evaporites correlated to the Lower Evaporites in Sicily (DFCIMA & WEZEL, 1971, 1973; McKENZIE, 1985; DECIMA et alii, 1988) and to the Vena del Gesso in the northern Apennines (VAI & RICCI LUCCHI, 1977; ROVERI et alii, 2001; 2003; 2004). Above the Messinian evaporites, brownish marls, micritic- and brecciated-limestones rest unconformably on an erosional surface (the intra-Messinian unconformity). The NRD measurements have been carried out in three quarry-sections: 1) the Buzzi-Unicem (Trovigliano); 2) the Lafargessi (Trovigliano); 3) the Colle di Votta (Abbateggio). Combining the stratigraphy of these different sections, a composite stratigraphic Column, which starts from the pre-evaporitic euxinic shales and Lip to the base of the post-evaporitic deposits, can be reconstructed. For each quarry-sections, the field gamma-ray profile has been obtained with a 20 cm regularly-spaced measurement of the gamma ray emission. Field NRD measurements and spectral acquisition have been done by using the portable spectrometer ""Rainbow 7010 MCA"", equipped with a gamma scintillator having a NaI (Tl) 2 "" x2 "" crystal as detector. Different NRD values, in terms both Of Count per second (Cps) measured in the field and of U-ppm, Th-ppm, % K2O from laboratory analyses, allow us to recognize some NRD facies, which correspond to the main lithofacies within the Messinian deposits of the Maiella Mts. In terms of NRD values we have been able to distinguish the following facies (fig. 8): a) limestone - 20 Cps, 2.58 U-ppm, 0.33 Th-ppm, 1.01 % K2O; b) massive selenite with carbonate - 11.1 Cps, 0.74 U-ppm, no detectable Th-ppm, 0.38 % K2O; c) massive selenite - 7.13 Cps, 0.30 U-ppm, on detectable Th-ppm, 0.40 % K2O; d) giant selenite - 6.95 Cps, 0.07 U-ppm, 0.08 Th-ppm, 0.33 % K2O; e) euxinic shale - 49 Cps, 4.76 U-ppm, 1.19 Th-ppm, 13.48 % K2O; f) sapropel - 33 Cps, 1.04 U-ppm, 1.52 Th-ppm, 18.57 % K2O; g) branching selenite - 8.3 Cps, 0.52 U-ppm, 0.11 Th-ppm, 1.16 % K2O; h) gypsarenites - 9.1 Cps, 0.88 U-ppm, 0.19 Th-ppm, 1.16 % K2O; i) fine laminated gypsarenites - 10.3 Cps, 0.95 U-ppm, 0.43 Th-ppm, 5.43 % K2O; 1) brecciated limestone - 42 Cps, 5.29 U-ppm, 0.21 Th-ppm, 0.89 % K2O. In the gamma-ray profiles (figs. 5, 6 and 7), the NRD signal allows us to distinguish each evaporitic cycle, characterized by low values of radioactivity, separated by sapropel horizons that show high gamma-ray emission. The gamma-ray profile of Colle di Votta section allows us to distinguish the Messinian evaporitic succession from the lower portion of the post-evaporitic Messinian deposits. in fact, the evaporitic and post-evaporitic Messinian deposits are characterized by different background values of the gamma-ray profile, which are about 10 Cps and 20-30 Cps, respectively. In terms of Th-ppm/U-ppm ratio, the main lithofacies of the Gessoso-Solfifera Fm show different values (tab. 1 and fig. 9b). Generally, sapropel are characterized by Th-ppm/U-ppm >= 1. On the contrary, limestones and gypsum deposits are characterized by values of Th-ppm/U-ppm << 1. These differences in the Th-ppm/U-ppm ratio could reCapt'ed to changes in the detrital input into the sedimentary basin. In this frame, values of Th-ppm/U-ppm << 1 could be referred to decrease in the input of extra-basinal detrital grains and to the formation of authigenic U-minerals (ADAMS & WEAVER, 1958). On the contrary, Th-ppm/U-ppm << 1 Could correspond to an increase in the input of detrital grains into the sedimentary basin. Changing of the Th-ppm/U-ppm ratio in the stratigraphic section Could also indicate alternation between humid (Th-ppm/U-ppm >= 1) and and (Th-ppm/U-ppm << 1) conditions. In conclusion, NRD analyses could supply information about several parameters connected with the evolution of sedimentary basin, such as: abundance of organic matter, redox condition, detrital input, climatic changes, etc. Thus, NRD field and laboratory investigations on stratigraphic sections could be a useful tool foci basin analysis.",,

Here we reconstruct sedimentary factories and ecosystem change across the Permian-Triassic Critical Interval (P-TrCI) in the Xiakou area (South China). Six microfacies (MF) were classified. The succession begins with a eukaryote-controlled carbonate factory (MF-1) that passes upward into an organomineralization-dominated carbonate factory (MF-2-3). Organic-rich marls atop these units reflect carbonate factory collapse (MF-4). Organomineralization-driven carbonate formation restarts prior to the Permian-Triassic boundary (MF-5) and subsequently develops into a mixed carbonate factory where organomineralization and biomineralization are almost equally important (MF-6). MF-1 reflects oxygenated shallow water environments. In contrast, MF-2-6 were all deposited in somewhat deeper environments, some of which episodically exhibited elevated salinities, oxygen depletion, and, possibly, euxinic conditions. Our results demonstrate that distinct changes in carbonate production styles, biodiversity, and environmental conditions are not synchronous at Xiakou. Furthermore, the Xiakou record is strikingly different to that of other localities, even from the same area (e.g., the Global Stratotype Section and Point section at Meishan). Together, these findings highlight the enormous complexity of the P-TrCI and calls simplified views of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction into question.",,https://static.aminer.cn/storage/pdf/biorxiv/20/2008/2020.08.10.244210/1.1/244210.pdf

These functions confirm the suitability of a general type of distribution (Sanz 1996), which is a borderline case of the lognormal distribution. The statistical methods proposed for the lithological types presented can be applied to any region if data on flow and lithology of the aquifers drained by springs are available. These methods have been applied to Spain, a representative region with varied geology, climate and topography; 71.2% of spring flow is supplied by limestones, 19.17% by alluvial sediments and marls, 6.7% by conglomerates and sandstones, and 3% by slates, plutonic rocks, quartzites, and other groups. Springs with discharge rates exceeding 2000 L/s exist only in limestones. The majority of springs with low flow occur in marls. If we consider springs with flow greater than 0.5 L/s, alluvial sediments, sandstones, marls, and limestones have the greatest density of springs per surface area, although the average flow varies greatly from one lithology to the next. The cumulative estimated discharge and the estimated number of springs depend upon the definition of the lower limit of flow. For example, total discharge is reduced by 30 % if we eliminate all springs with flow lower than 0.5 L/min.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/21/48/78/2148782F7B60E34E134BE73940AD7AB7.pdf

Edgell'}]","Permian strata form thick sequences in the Middle East, especially through south Iran and adjacent Iraq and, to a lesser extent, in eastern Arabia. Apart from basal sandstones previously considered as Carboniferous, the Permian System in these areas consists predominantly of carbonate formations. These formations have all the characteristics of favourable reservoir rocks. They represent thick, fractured, limestone-dolomite sequences and are often foetid, oily or bituminous in outcrop. Significant gas production has been obtained from these Permian strata in the Dammam Field and at Bahrain for many years. In recent years, very large gas fields have been discovered in Permian strata of south Iran and, especially in Coastal Fars at Kangan, Dalan, Nar, Kuh-e Aghar and Kuh-e Mand, as well as in the Persian Gulf (e.g. Pars C structure). These large gas reserves are of great significance in the future development of Iran. The thick Permian carbonate sequences of south Iran, now known as the Dalan Formation (NIOC Geological Sub-Committee July 1976), were formerly referred to as the Khuff Formation, a much thinner stratigraphic unit of Permian carbonates, which occurs in Arabia. Stratigraphic and paleontological analysis of many Permian sections shows that prospective strata are almost invariably Upper Permian. The importance of the Permian sequence in Iran, Iraq and Arabia is that it concordantly underlies almost every known productive oilfield structure, as well as the majority of prospective ones. The Permian Dalan and Khuff formations, thus represent a very extensive hydrocarbon reservoir and, wherever possible, drilling should be continued to test these formations. In the thicker sequences of south Iran, much of the section in made up of highly fossiliferous, fusulinid and coral limestones with considerable associated dolomitization. These Permian reef type limestones are an attractive prospect as reservoir rocks because they are: 1. conformably involved in major oilfield structures and many large unproved, anticlines. 2. mostly capped by Triassic marls and evaporites. 3. are significantly fractured and dolomitized with secondary porosity. 4. are mostly organic limestones and thus potential source and reservoir rocks. 5. often oily or bituminous in outcrop and already known to produce gas in at least seven major oil fields.",,

Dulepova'}]","The results of long-term studies of the vegetation of chalk outcrops of the Orenburg region (Russian Federation) and North-West Kazakhstan on Sub-Ural plateau and adjacent territories are presented. Chalk outcrops are unique botanical-geographical sites located in steppe and desert zones of Eurasia. Specific communities of calcephyte plant species have spread in these areas, in places of outcrops or close occurrence from the surface of upper-Cretaceous carbonate rocks. The flora of chalk outcrops is characterized by a great amount of rare species, mainly ende­mic, associated with peculiar substrates, the locality of habitats, and the historical past of the area of outcrops location (Matyshenko, 1985) The history of the study of flora and vegetation of chalk outcrops is given. Synthaxonomic studies of chalk vegetation as part of the ecological-floristic approach cover only territories west of the Volga river (Poluyanov, 2009; Averinova, 2011, 2016; Demina, 2014; Demina et al., 2016; Didukh et al., 2018). Chalk highlands of the North-West Kazakhstan and adjacent regions of the Russian Federation occupy quite large areas. However, up to date, there is no data on the vegetation diversity of these territories based on complete geobotanical relevés, that is why their synthaxonomy remains undeveloped. The study area with 15 massifs of chalk outcrops (Fig. 1) includes the Orenburg region (Novosergievsky, Perevolotsky, Sol-Iletskiy, Akbulak and Gaysky districts), and Aktobe (Hobdinsky, Uilsky and Bayganinsky district) and Atyrau (Zhylyoysky district) regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The largest massifs in the Orenburg region of the Russian Federation are: Starobelogorskie (Fig. 2), Chesnokov­skie (Fig. 3), Verkhnechibendinskie (Fig. 6), Troits­kie (Fig. 7), Pokrovskie Chalk Mountains (Fig. 4) and Durtel mountain (Fig. 5). Chalk massif Akshatau (Fig. 8) and the range Aktolagai (Fig. 9) are the largest within Aktobe region. The investigated sites are mostly located on the Sub-Ural Plateau, which extended from the southern regions of the Orenburg region to the Emba River in the territory of Aktobe region. They are less common within the Obschiy Syrt and sporadic in the Guberlinskie mountains. The study area covers a wide range of zonal vegetation from dry steppes in the northern part of the gradient to northern deserts in the southern one. The dataset includes 270 relevés of chalk outcrops communities performed by the authors in 2014–2019. The primary classification was carried out using TWINSPAN algorithm. As a result three groups of communities are established. The first group is communities of the Emben Plateau, the most southern area; second is communities on relatively developed soils in the slopes bases, depressions between chalk ridges and on their flat tops; third is widespread communities on most of the Podural Plateau and Obschy Syrt, excluding the Emben Plateau. Comparison with associations of calcephyte, semidesert and steppe vegetation (Golub, 1994; Kolomiychuk, Vynokurov, 2016; Lysenko, Yamalov, 2017; Didukh et al., 2018; Korolyuk, 2017) was made to determine the position of studied communities in the system of ecological-floristic classification of the herbasceous vegetation of Eurasia. Cluster analysis results (Fig. 10) revealed the significant specificity the chalk outcrops of the Sub-Ural Plateau in comparison with calciphytic communities of Eastern Europe, as well as with deserts and steppes zonal vegetation. That was the reason to describe a new class for vegetation of the studied chalk outcrops. The class Anabasietea cretaceae Golovanov class nov. hoc loco.

This discontinuity is recorded in various successions described along a palaeoslope joining the Vocontian Basin and the Provence platform, between the Jabron valley in the west and the Var valley in the east. The successions including Aptian marls always exhibit an omission surface with Rhizocorallium. Through this area, the Aptian discontinuity equates to at least part of the Goguel Level. The latter is represented by black shales occurring in the Vocontian Basin at the top of Deshayesi zone and is a regional expression of the global anoxic event OAE1a. Thus, the surface with Rhizocorallium can be regarded, on the North-Provence margin, as a marker coincident with the onset of the anoxic event which, in the Vocontian basin, succeeded to a nannoconid crisis. Representing a short event, the surface is also a marker of various processes: (1) current activity, deduced from a dominant orientation of Rhizocorallium. The Barremian-early Aptian carbonate succession is strongly eroded by the formerly more active currents along the Peipin Channel, south-east of Sisteron; these currents also led to the omission of the Bedoulian (= carbonate Lower Aptian) to upper Valanginian series from the top of the hemipelagic palaeoreliefs in the eastern Castellane arc; (2) tectonic activity in the Lower Aptian, marked by N080 degrees to N100 degrees extension faults and slumping of a semi-lithified carbonate sediment.

The ore is shear hosted and consists primarily of disseminated native gold in several mineralized zones near the contact between quartz-feldspar porphyry and metasedimentary rocks. Metsasedimentary rocks (i.e., pelite, graywacke, arenite, marl, mafic fragmental rocks, and baritic sediment) host most of the ore. The dominant alteration is potassic and is characterized by a central zone of granoblastic microcline-quartz-(barite-muscovite-biotite-pyrite) rocks, surrounded by muscovite-quartz-pyrite schists. Regional, amphibolite-facies metamorphism (similar to 630 degrees C, 5-7 kbars) overprinted the ore zones and recrystallized the alteration assemblages. Unaltered metasedimentary wall rocks contain the assemblages biotite-garnet-staurolite-kyanite and/or sillimanite (metapelite) and amphibole-plagioclase (mafic fragmental rocks and marly sediment). As tire ore zones are approached, the proportions of muscovite and K-feldspar and the mole fraction of pyrope in garnet increase, garnet, staurolite, and kyanite gradually disappear, biotite becomes Mg rich, ilmenite is replaced by rutile, and pyrrhotite is replaced by pyrite. In altered and mineralized mafic fragmental rocks, biotite replaced amphibole, which indicates that amphibole was present prior to alteration and that gold mineralization occurred at pressure-temperature conditions equivalent to those of the greenschist facies (400 degrees-500 degrees C, 3-5 kbars). The presence of garnet and staurolite in unaltered metasedimentary rocks, but not in the ore zones, is consistent with phase equilibria which indicate that only Mg-rich silicates an coexist with pyrite, and that Mg-rich end members of garnet and staurolite are only stable at temperatures and pressures considerably higher than those of peak metamorphism. This change in mineral assemblage is due primarily to the very high f(s2) during alteration and gold mineralization, which caused iron to partition preferentially into pyrite, and is supported by the decrease in the Fe/Mg ratio of garnet and biotite toward the ore zones. Similarly, the absence of kyanite in the ore zones, despite its common occurrence in the immediately adjacent wall rocks, can be attributed directly to the high activity of potassium, which stabilized the assemblage muscovite-microcline in favor of the assemblage kyanite-muscovite. The combined effects of sulfidation and potassic alteration ensured that all phases in the ore zones participated directly or indirectly in metamorphic reactions. The evolution of such rocks therefore differs significantly from those of normal metasedimentary rocks. In general, typical peak metamorphic assemblages do not develop, and thus timing relationships of mineralization hosted by amphibolite-grade rocks are obscured. However, the disappearance of metamorphic index minerals, modification of mineral assemblages, and mineralogical changes in sulfides and oxides that are recognizable on an outcrop scale at Hemlo serve as important vectors to economic mineralization.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/9A/A2/E8/9AA2E8B128733C1D77837AF12D11673B.pdf

The metamarls were collected in the Kalkschiefer from the Termen zone (Liskay; 1965) and underwent lower amphibolites pressure- temperature conditions (Kamber; 1993). The metamarls contain up to 1.6 wt% and have an assemblage consisting of garnet, biotite, white mica, clinozoisite, carbonates (calcite and ankerite), ilmenite, pyrite and accessories minerals such as zircon, tourmaline and apatite. Garnets are dodecahedral porphyroblasts with a size of 0.6 mm to 4.8 mm. Their diameter is larger in S1 schistosity plane. All garnets display two distinct zones. The outer zone is graphite rich and has clinozoisite, carbonates, and quartz inclusions. The width of the graphite rich rim decrease with an increase of garnet diameter. The central zone shows 6 sectors without graphite inclusions and radiating from the centre of the crystal. The sectors contain a few quartz rods oriented normal to the garnet growth face. Irregular birefringent lamellae oriented also normal to the face of the crystal can be observed in the sectors. The width of the lamellae varies from one to twenty microns and their length can reach up to 500 microns. The sectors and birefringent zones are absent in the smallest garnets (d<1.5mm). Element X-ray maps and profile were made on centrally cut garnets of different sizes. Compositional profiles show a decrease of Mn and an increase of Fe and Mg from core to rim. Mn X-ray maps and profiles document a chemical sector zoning in agreement with the inclusion sector zoning. Ca X-ray maps (fig. 1) show in sectors anomalous Ca richer lamellae oriented normal to the garnet faces. Those zones correspond to the anomalous birefringent lamellae. These lamellae do probably not represent exsolution, since they only occur within the six sectors. They are also parallel to the quartz rod inclusions. The most likely explanation is that these Ca-rich lamellae are growth structures linked to the interaction of the garnet surface with the graphite rich matrix. This implies that garnet composition is, on a second order, influenced by surface kinetics. In the graphite rich rim, the Ca zoning is parallel to the garnet faces and indicates a close to equilibrium growth process.",,

The age and genesis of these deposits prevails to be a subject of much debate and models of syn- to late diagenetic metal enrichment are competing with those proposing epigenetic processes of ore formation involving external mineralizing solutions. We have performed systematic Re-Os analyses on a drill core from the formerly economic Kupferschiefer district near Mansfeld (Germany). Samples were selected from a 90 cm section that encompasses the entire sequence of Kupferschiefer black shales and underlying, ore-bearing conglomerates, sandwiched between two layers of condensed marls. The Kupferschiefer black shales display c(Re) = 3-956 ppb; c(Os) = 65-4050 ppt and 187Os/188Os = 1.3-12.3. In contrast, the Re and Os contents of the conglomerates are lower by one order of magnitude (c(Re) = 5-130 ppb; c(Os)=27-329 ppt) and their isotopic ratios show a range with 187Re/188Os = 1723-47688 and 187Os/188Os = 6-177. Two sulfide samples extracted from the conglomerates yielded 187Re/188Os = 9392/44976 and 187Os/188Os = 32.0/153.52 (c(Re) = 2.95/3.54 ppm; c(Os) = 7.20/8.29 ppb), respectively. In a 187Os/188Os vs. 187Re/188Os diagram, the entire data set including the sulfide ores defines a statistically robust isochron (MSWD = 1.5; n = 12) corresponding to an age of 204.3 ± 0.5 Ma (187Os/188Osi = 0.543 ± 0.021) which we interpret as the age of Kupferschiefer mineralization in the Mansfeld district. This Lower Jurassic Re-Os age is in perfect agreement with previously published K-Ar studies (Bechtel et al. 1999) and clearly favors epigenetic models of ore genesis. Our results point to a process of preferential Re mobilization/migration from the primarily Re-rich Kupferschiefer black shales into the underlying, permeable conglomerates by external ore-forming solutions, thereby resetting and homogenizing the Re- Os system among cogenetic neoformations and reorganized phases.",,

The successions including Aptian marls always exhibit an omission surface with Rhizocorallium. Through this area, the Aptian discontinuity equates to at least part of the Goguel Level.

Thus, the surface with Rhizocorallium can be regarded, on the North-Provence margin, as a marker coincident with the onset of the anoxic event which, in the Vocontian basin, succeeded to a nannoconid crisis. Representing a short event, the surface is also a marker of various processes: (1) current activity, deduced from a dominant orientation of Rhizocorallium. The Barremian-early Aptian carbonate succession is strongly eroded by the formerly more active currents along the Peipin Channel, south-east of Sisteron; these currents also led to the omission of the Bedoulian (= carbonate Lower Aptian) to upper Valanginian series from the top of the hemipelagic palaeoreliefs in the eastern Castellane arc; (2) tectonic activity in the Lower Aptian, marked by N080 degrees to N100 degrees extension faults and slumping of a semi-lithified carbonate sediment.

Coastal Plain suggested an episodic pattern of escalation within, the naticid gastropod predator-prey system. This study examines escalation from the perspective of naticid prey selectivity. If escalation occurred within the system, less selectivity of prey may be apparent in the Paleogene compared to younger assemblages. We test this hypothesis for four Eocene Coastal Plain assemblages. Contrary to predictions, intraspecific prey size selectivity was well developed for nine of eleven bivalve prey species. Drillhole size (indicating predator size) correlated significantly with prey size, especially for successful drillholes. Few incomplete or nonfunctional drillholes occurred except within corbulid species. Interspecific prey selectivity was less developed than for Neogene or Recent assemblages. Naticid prey preferences predicted by cost-benefit analysis were consistent with actual drilling frequencies only for the Bashi Marl Member of the Hatchetigbee Formation (Alabama). In the Piney Point Formation of Virginia, all prey items were drilled at equivalent frequencies, despite their different cost-benefit rankings.

The information used to conduct the PSHA includes the characterization of seismic sources of significance to the bridge site and the characterization of ground motion attenuation relationships applicable to hard rock in the eastern United States. The second basic analysis conducted for the study was an analysis of crustal response to the hard rock motions. For this analysis, the response of soft rock extending from the top of hard rock at 800 m depth to the base of Cooper Marl at 100 m depth was evaluated. The presence of a thick, relatively low velocity soft rock layer having a strong velocity (impedance) contrast with the underlying hard rock resulted in a substantial amplification of long-period ground motions in the analysis.

They may be exemplified by polyhalite representing a sulfate rock in salt deposits, in which both halite and sulfate are rock-forming components. Two (or sometimes more) karsting components can be contained not only in rocks, but also in separate beds (and sequences). For example, rock beds composed of sulfate‐carbonate material are widespread (Devonian of the Pripyat Trough, Cambrian of the Siberian Platform, and others). Some beds of the Green River Formation in the United States consist of halite and trona (water-dissoluble sodium carbonate) [1]. The hierarchical succession (sequence, bed, rock) is terminated by poorly known (in the aspect under consideration) sulfate‐carbonate minerals, such as tychite, nakauriite, carrboydite, and others. In the considered case, the rock loses two karsting components due to erosion: carbonates and solid organic (carbonaceous) matter (OM). The rocks in question are high-carbonaceous marls (O 2 kk) in the Baltic shale basin, which are mined as fuel and chemical raw material (production of phenol, hardening materials, and others). Development and processing of these rocks required their more comprehensive study in the basin, including subsurface karst areas subjected to the influence of descending fluid filtration [2 among others]. The technical name of these marls (oil shale, kukersite) does not reflect adequately their lithological properties. With respect to lithology, they consist largely of three components: OM, carbonate material, and terrigenous material. Their proportions are highly variable (average 35, 40, and 25 wt %, respectively) [3]. Despite numerous studies dedicated to karstification of these marls, the contribution of OM to the formation of voids and contraction of bed thickness was underestimated in previous works. It appeared that the low density of OM (approximately 1) makes it the most significant volumetric component of these rocks. For example, contents of OM and carbonates are 35 and 40 wt %, respectively, whereas their volumetric proportions are 54 and 25%, respectively (table). It means that carbonates represent the major rock-forming components in terms of weight and the subordinate components in terms of volume. Thus, among the two karsting components, OM plays the main role in the formation of voids, contraction of bed, and decrease of its thickness (and associated deformations). This fact provided grounds to define a new, carbonaceous karst type (by analogy with its other types, such as carbonate, sulfate, and other types) and widen the spectrum of karsting rocks by including the rocks under consideration [4]. The reduction of thickness due to karst denudation in a shale bed 1.5‐1.8 m thick (without rock interbeds) was approximately 0.8‐1.0 m at the expense of OM and only 0.3‐0.4 m at the expense of carbonates [4].",,

The overlying sedimentary rocks include marls and marly limestones with sandstone intercalations and belong to the Pliocene sediments. The following lateritic zones are defined from the bottom to top layers: a) bedrock (norite); b) serpentinized zone; c) goethitic zone. The bedrock consists of the following primary minerals: basic plagioclase, orthopyroxenes and clinopyroxenes. The serpentinized zone includes clinochrysotile, lizardite, antigorite clinoenstatite, calcite and dolomite while in the goethic zone there are goethite, quartz, pyrite, chromite, dolomite. A12O3, Fe2O3, CaO, Na2O, K2O, Ba, Sr, Ni, C and S are enriched in the goethitic zone. Nickel enrichment is related to the formation of nickeliferons minerals substituting for Mg or/and Fe in the goethite and pyrite. Enrichment of Ni in the matrix may be due to the presence of amorphous Ni-silicates (pimelite). There is a significant change (decrease) in the concentration of Ni from the top to bottom parts of the laterite formation, indicating that there was no tendency to migrate downwards (immature laterite). A second support of the immaturity of the Vatera laterite is the incomplete oxidation of ferrous iron to form ferric iron hydroxides. Under tropical/subtropical conditions, which dominated from the end of Miocene to the Pliocene the norite rocks of the Vatera area altered in response to reaction with acid solutions enriched in CO2. Due to hydrolysis and oxidation of pyroxenes, Mg2+, P4SiO4 and Ni2+ were removed in the continental acid solutions.",,

The lower unit consists of grey lime-mudstone, marl and micritic limestone intercalated towards the top with fine siliciclastics, which reflect two stages of palagolake evolution. Initially, the lake was relatively deep with steep margins, experienced occasional periodic emergence, and had lacustrine carbonates deposited. During the second stage, the lake was generally shallower, had gently sloping margins and had become a palustrine setting in which fluctuations of the water level caused extensive emergence. Pedogenic processes affected most of the lake deposits, and modification was very intense in the marginal facies. The upper unit includes dolostone and cherts, which are indicative of lake desiccation and evaporitic conditions. Evidence from geochemical, petrographical and mineralogical analyses clearly indicates a gradual shift from open, freshwater lake conditions during deposition of the lower unit to closed, saline and alkaline waters during deposition of the upper unit. Climate and topography were the main controls on vertical facies variations of the palustrine carbonates. Climate influenced episodic lake water level fluctuations, whereas topography of the basin, which changed through time in response to tectonic uplift of the lake margins, influenced water run-off as well as the frequency and length of subaerial exposure.",,

The analysis of ASTER bands ratios yields valuable results in terms of the mineral differentiation of the Zagros Mountain substrates and hence, can be utilized as a tool for lithological mapping. Additionally, the statistical mechanics approach used to assess the relation between existing gully locations and the combinations of lithologic predictor variables show that gullies have a high probability in areas showing substrates with high amounts of salt, gypsum and marl, especially in the plain areas.

PENTEADO'}]","The Potiguar Basin lies in the northeastern part of Brazil and covers an area of approximately 60,000 km2, with its onshore portion occupying 40% of total area. The Potiguar Basin is a rift basin that evolved to a passive margin after the break-up of the African and South American continents in the Early Cretaceous. During more than 30 years of exploration activities in the basin, various studies were performed aiming at the identification of different oil families and their spatial relationship. Oil correlation studies in the onshore part of the Potiguar Basin based on gas chromatography (GC), GC coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and carbon isotopic data allowed the identification of three basic oil types: oils generated in the continental sequence (Neocomian and Aptian lacustrine freshwater shales), oils generated in the transitional sequence (Aptian marine evaporitic shales and marls), and oils derived from the mixture of the two previous types (Trindade et al., 1992; Mello el al., 1993). The developments in analytical methods have established Organic Geochemistry as one of the most effective tools to characterize petroleum in terms of origin, thermal evolution and biodegradation. These developments allowed an increasing number of organic compounds to be identified and quantified. This capability, in turn, has allowed scientists to attack ever more complex problems, but the larger number of samples that must be analysed and the number of constituents that can be measured per sample give rise to data sets of enormous size and complexity. The main objective of this study is to present one methodology of sampling in which the data set recovered from a larger one is representative of distinct groups of oils based on geochemical parameters throughout the basin. The sampling of a representative subset will allow statistical analyses to be performed more effectively in a relatively smaller number of samples. This subset of samples will be used in the future for further classification techniques to investigate new grouping patterns. The first step of the method consists in running a cluster analysis on the original data set. Cluster analysis is one of the multivariate statistical methods that measure the similarity between objects. This technique determines the structural characteristics of a data set by dividing the data into related groups. Cluster analysis is an exploratory data analysis procedure, hence it is usually applied to data sets for which there is no a priori knowledge",,

However, they may diminish the properties if they are poorly designed. Hence, the objective of this study is to experimentally investigate the potentiality of nanoparticles in the WBM. This is achieved by investigating and comparing the impact of very low concentrations of commercially affordable two types of nanoparticles on the rheological, hydraulic and filtration properties of flocculated water-based muds (WBMs). The optimum type and concentration that enhance these properties and optimize the hydraulics of the mud are targeted. In this research, the samples were prepared as high pH (11.5-12) WBMs and with two different types and various concentrations of anionic nanosilica and nanotitanium particles. Series of laboratory tests were carried out for all samples using standard API Low Pressure Low Temperature (LPLT) filtration and rheological devices. For the hydraulic evaluation, a commercially available software was used to estimate the impact of the nanoparticles on the equivalent circulation density (ECD) and the drillpipe pressure (DPP) in a typical directional well. Results show significant enhancements in the rheological and hydraulics properties of the flocculated WBMs treated by 0.1% wt. or less of nanosilica and 0.3% wt. or less of nanotitanium. The results show the ability of these concentrations to reduce the filtration, make the filter cake consistent, compacted, fragile, smooth, and thin and prevent the spurt water loss. However, the results reflect the poor impact of the concentrations above 0.3% by weight on the mud’s properties. As rheological modifiers and filtration inhibitors, nanoparticles used in this research play vital roles in reducing drilling problems and later costs if they are properly formulated. Hence, stuck pipe, formation damage, and shale swelling can be overcome. Thus, slim holes and horizontal wells can be drilled using water-based nanomuds instead of oil-based muds that are expensive and environmentally unacceptable. Introduction The failure to optimize or balance drilling fluid properties due to poor designs leads to many drilling problems and longer drilling times. This makes the drilling mud one of the major aspects that either increases or decreases the well cost and later the production capacity. Therefore, it has to be efficient enough to overcome the problems, thereby reducing the drilling costs. For instance, it has to overcome shale swelling, prevent stuck pipe, reduce bit balling, minimize generated torque and drag, prevent formation caving/sloughing, minimize surge and swab pressures, reduce reservoir damage, prevent mud circulation loss, and enhance insufficient hydraulics (Salih et al. 2016). All these problems are directly related to the rheological, filtration and hydraulics properties of the drilling muds. In turn, these properties are directly related to the flocculation level of the mud. Flocculation is one of the detrimental phenomena in the WBMs. It results in poor mud properties (Salih et al. 2016). The flocculated WBM is one of the causes of the abovementioned problems. It results in high filtration, yield point, viscosity, gel strength, mudcake thickness, and low mud pumpability, and its rheological behavior and filtration property are not stable under complicated drilling conditions. Therefore, oil-based mud is a more suitable solution to minimize drilling problems. However, unlike the water-based muds, it is environmentally and economically unfavorable. Exposing poorly designed WBMs to cationic bearingenvironments, containments, lead to the flocculation. Hence, various soluble contaminants such as salts, cement, anhydrite or gypsum that are present in drilling operations result in flocculation (Salih et al. 2016). In addition, high temperature and high mud pH cause flocculation. Therefore, the WBM’s properties must be enhanced to increase the resistance to contamination by various chemicals. This increases the stability under different conditions. Conventional chemicals are used to treat the mud with poor performance under harsh conditions. For example, conventional filtration inhibitors do not function under high temperatures since they reduce the filtration by increasing the viscosity of the water-based mud’s continuous phase. Therefore, researchers have recently incorporated the nanoparticles as new and smart additives to the water-based mud and have made it as a water-based nano mud. The water-based nano mud contains one or more chemical additive particles sized in nanoscale, 1m=10μ=10nm. Unlike AADE-17-NTCE-129 Impact of Anionic Nanoparticles on the Rheological, Filtration and Hydraulic Properties of the Flocculated Water-Based Drilling Fluids Salih, A. H. and Bilgesu, H. I., West Virginia University 2 Salih, A. H. and Bilgesu, H. I. AADE-17-NTCE-129 their parents, these nanoparticles are characterized by high surface area to volume ratio, by providing surplus charges to the mud, by having tiny sizes, by having super sensitivity, and by having perfect particles distribution (Amanulah et al. 2011). Figure 1 illustrates the new particles after crashing a parent particle. As chemicals, they are strongly charged particles and they are classified into cationic and anionic nanoparticles according to the ion (atom) types on their surface. Therefore, few amounts of them can play significant roles and perform multi-functions in the drilling mud. The result is the waterbased nano mud with the advantages of the oil-based mud, but it is cheaper and environmentally acceptable (Salih et al. 2016). Figure 1: Surface Area to Volume Ratio of Nanoparticles (Salih et al. 2016) Due to their features, they can change the internal link process and distribution of the clay particles, Bentonite platelets. The result is a wide range of drilling fluid behaviors and filtration properties that is also based on their types, concentrations, sizes, structure, pH, and charging types. Recently, various nanoparticles were investigated and their performances were reported by many researchers such as Sharma et al. (2012), Sensoy et al. (2009), Cai et al. (2011), Li et al. (2012), Riley et al. (2012), etc. based on different methodologies. Hence, different performance of nanoparticles was described. For instance, some nanoparticles work as a perfect bridging agent due their tiny sizes. Therefore, they physically plug the nanometer-sized pores and shut off water loss in shale formations, thereby preventing shale swelling and its related problems. Properly formulated nanoparticles with water-based mud can replace the oil-based mud used as a shale swelling inhibitor. For the same reason, the nanoparticles can reduce the filtration and enhance the associated mudcake properties—they result in thin, compacted, smooth, and plaster like mudcake ((Srivatsa & Ziaja 2011), (Javeri et al. 2011), (Salih et al. 2016), (Zakaria et al. 2012), and (Ismail et al. 2014)). However, selecting the optimum size and structure of nanoparticles that show superior plugging is challenging. The water-based nano mud with hydrophilic film forming capability on the surface of drillbit can mitigate the bit balling problem— this is due to the high surface area to volume ratio and very low concentration requirements of the nanoparticles (El-Diasty and Ragab 2013). This occurs especially in sticky formations such as marl and shale rocks. As a result of minimizing the bit balling, the rate of penetration will increase. The nanoparticles play significant roles in reducing the torque and drag forces throughout drilling operations. They work as lubricants, reducing the friction between the drill string and the well wall interface. Similarly, this feature helps in reducing the plastic viscosity—they work as ball bearings to facilitate the solids movement in the mud. Hence, the stuck pipe, equivalent circulation density (ECD), and circulation pressure loss can be reduced. By reducing the ECD, the mud circulation loss problem can be minimized. Proper shape and size of the nanoparticles should be selected for high performance. Interestingly, only few amounts of the nanoparticles can enhance the rheological properties of the WBM due to high sensitivity and superior interaction with the Bentonite particles. However, based on their properties, they may increase or decrease the rheological properties such as the yield point and gel strength. Therefore, critical concentrations must not be exceeded in order to avoid damage to rheological properties ((Amanullah et al. 2011), (Contreras et al. 2014 a&b), (Jung et al. 2011), (Fakoya and Shah 2013), and (Nasser et al. 2013)). It has been reported by Amanulah et al. (2011) that the nanoparticles have less kinetic energy impact, thereby increasing the life of the downhole tools. It is well known that wear and tear decrease the life of the tools. They are caused by the forces created due to the extreme kinematic energy associated with the large particles continuously added to the mud either naturally such as drilled cuttings or by rig crew for specific purposes during drilling operations (Salih et al. 2016). These forces can be minimized by replacing the large quantities of micro particle additives with a small amount of nanoparticles for the same purposes. By replacing the big particles with tiny particles, the plastic viscosity will decrease which is desirable. According to the above-cited researches, it is obvious that the nano-based drilling fluids are regarded as a new generation of drilling fluids—they have been recently discovered. This implies the possibility of a wide range of further studies and improvements using nanoparticles with drilling fluids. In addition, it is seen that not all the used nanoparticles enhanced all the mud properties simultaneously. Therefore, the researchers need",,

They are member of the supracrustal series composed of various mica-chlorite schists with the intercalations of leptinites, gneisses, quartzites, amphibolites and calc-silicate rocks. The ""Jerzy"" quarry, where schists (metapelites) are excavated, is situated in the north-western part of the Stara Kamienica Range. The strike of the schists is close to W-E, and their dip is 50-70°N. Metapelites in this quarry are thin-laminated rocks of the colour varying from grey through green-grey to dark green. Occasionally, the change of the colours could be observed due to weathering processes. Light mica in the schists adds a silver lustre to the colour of the rocks. The lamination is in large scale almost undisturbed, though local slight folding or rippling of small amplitude may be quite commonly noticed; larger folds may occur in the neighbourhood of faults. In the rock the mica- and chlorite-rich laminae alternate with those composed of grey quartz (Makała, 1994). Of particular interest are garnet-rich schist intercalations. They occur in the whole area of the Stara Kamienica Range, but particularly in its western part. Previous investigations of the rock and rock-forming minerals from the described area were largely connected to the examinations of the cassiterite-sulfide mineralisation (Jaskólski, Mochnacka 1958, Jaskólski 1963, Szałamacha and Szałamacha 1974, Kowalski et al. 1978, Wiszniewska 1984, Siemiątkowski 2001). Petrographically the schists from the Stara Kamienica Range are highly variable. This is a result of the protolith variability; the protolith was composed from clayey, clayey-marly rocks, sandy marls and calcareous rocks. The present-day variability of the metapelites also results from the complicated metamorphic processes in the study area. The schists from the Stara Kamienica Range were subdivided into several varieties on the basis of quantitative analysis of the mica minerals, chlorite and quartz (Smulikowski 1958, Kozłowski 1974). The schists cropping out in the ""Jerzy"" quarry were subdivided by Szałamacha and Szałamacha (1974). These authors distinguished 8 types of the schist: 1 - chlorite-mica-quartz schists, 2 - chlorite-mica-quartz schists with garnets, 3 - chlorite-mica-quartz schists with kyanite and chloritoid, 4 - muscovite-chlorite- quartz schists, 5 - chlorite-quartz schists, 6 - chlorite-quartz-garnet schists, 7 -",,

Regional investigation stage is not finished during the stage investigations of Precambrian deposits of ancient platforms. The main task of geochemical investigations during this stage includes emphasizing of oil-source horizons, their qualitative and quantitative characteristics: determination of genetic types of organic matter, its maturity level, oil-source potential and its realization degree, investigation of composition of naphtides (in case they exist) and possible determination of genetic connections of them with concrete oil-source horizons. Perspectives of oil-bearing capacity of the regions from the geochemical point of view are being determined by the productivity of oil- and gas-formation centers, i.e. presence of oil- and gas-source rocks of sufficient thickness and organic matter maturity level. Wide occurrence of Pre-Cambrian sedimentary formations, regional association of commercial oil-gas deposits and oil-shows let to consider Upper Proterozoic deposits of ancient platforms as promising object in respect of oil-gas content itself and as a source of oil in Paleozoic as well. Commercial oil-gas bearing established in South Oman, China and mainly Siberian Platform with main oil-bearing regions Nepsko-Botuobinsk and Bajkits anticlines. Small oil deposits were discovered in the East-European platform (Verkhne-Kamskaya depression, mainly in Vendian deposits (Sivinskoye, Ocherskoye, Shrkanskoye, Vereshchaginskoye et al.) and in Riphean ones (Polomskoye). The inflow of light oil was received from Danilovskoe field (Sredne-Russian avlacogene). In Storozhevskaya well (Vuchegodsk depression) asphalt bitumen have been revealed. Large oil and gas fields have been discovered in Precambrian deposits of Siberian platform: in Vendian deposits - Verhnechonskoe, Sredne-Botyobinskoe, Chajandinskoe, Sobinskoe; on Riphean - Kujumsinskoe and Urubchenskoe. Prolonged system of rifts filled by Riphean and rarely Lower Vendian sediments is known at the basement of Moscow and Mezensk synclines, Ryasano-Saratov depression and marginal part of the Volgo-Ural basin (the East-European platform), as well as Tungussk and Vilyujsk synclines (Siberian Platform). These buried rift depressions have different trends and are filled by up to 2–6 km of sedimentary deposits on the East-European platform and up to 8 km on the Siberian platform. Riphean rifts demonstrate independent structural pattern, significantly differing from the structure of the uppermost epirift levels of the sedimentary basins. This block-structure was formed due to tension, shiftshearing and upthrusting along the listric fault. In the outermost East of Eastern-European platform and in western, south-eastern and north-western part of Siberian platform Riphean deposits have accumulated in pericraton troughs, at that distribution area of Riphean deposits is incomparably larger on the Siberian platform than on the East-European platform. Upper Proterozoic deposits on the East-European platform are exclusively terrigeneous; in the upper part of Vendian deposits laminae of tufogenic material are observed. Lower Riphean deposits are mainly red-colored. Starting with Middle Riphean dark-colored layers sharply prevail. Upper Vendian deposits are mainly gray-colored, cherry-colored clays are rarely met. In the outermost eastern part of the platform carbonate strata is met (Kaltafinsk suite). Riphean deposits have extended thickness and variable colored lithological composition on he Siberian platform. Considerable part is composed of carbonate and clayey-carbonate rocks - dolomites, marls, clayey limestones. TOC content in most of the samples studied of East-European platform and Moscow syncline (Middle Russian oil-gas-bearinf basin is not high - 0,02–0,2%, but there are same laminae of clayey rocks with TOC content up to 5–6%, genetic potential to 5,5 kg HC/t of rock (R3, Moscow Graben), and 3%.",,

Spain) is well preserved and can be considered as being representative of the entire western Mediterranean. It exhibits a series of features relating to: (1) the composition, characteristics and evolution of coral reefs; (2) changes between temperate and subtropical climates; and (3) the extensive development of microbial carbonates (stromatolites and thrombolites) at the end of the Messinian. Each of these features has global significance. Porites, which is the major and almost only coral component in reefs, is heavily encrusted with stromatolites. These reefs grew at the edge of the subtropical belt and were totally eliminated at the end of the Messinian because of global cooling. Lowermost-Messinian carbonate sediments in the Sorbas Basin reflect a temperate climate, whereas those immediately above, which contain bioherms and coastal reefs, are subtropical. The shift from temperate to subtropical conditions during the early Messinian was accompanied by an important change in water circulation within the western Mediterranean. Temperate times were marked by cold surface Atlantic waters entering the Mediterranean, whereas subtropical times coincided with warm surface waters entering the western Mediterranean from the east. The subtropical waters were thermally stratified, which favoured the deposition of euxinic marls and diatomites at the centre of the basin. The upwelling of nutrient-rich water promoted stromatolite development within reefs and Halimeda growth on adjacent slopes. Lastly, microbial carbonates (stromatolites and thrombolites) attained giant dimensions during the late Messinian, which can be regarded as a measure of their success in occupying a variety of ecological niches. This abundance of available habitats is believed to have resulted from the Messinian ""salinity crisis"", which was followed by a re-colonization of the western Mediterranean. In this context stromatolite proliferation was due to opportunism of microbial communities in colonizing the new environments, rather than to a complete absence of other competitive biota. We do not believe that hypersaline conditions were a causal factor in stromatolite development because of the normal-marine biota associated with them.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/32/3C/FE/323CFE7A7E8FF3A2D511C5DFB66BE1B5.pdf

The investigated succession consists of subtidal, outer-carbonate ramp deposits, which may be ascribed to the Guadagnolo Formation. This Formation, of Aquitanian to Serravallian age, is made up of hundreds of metres of marls and limestones deposited in the transition zone between the Latium-Abruzzi carbonate platform and the Umbria-Sabine pelagic domain. The investigated section has a total thickness of 87 m and a well-defined cyclical pattern, where the facies combine to form shallowing-upward cycles. These subtidal cycles developed in the distal sector of an outer carbonate ramp environment. The Saracinesco section was interpreted as a depositional sequence of 3 r d order involving a time of 500,000 years. Inside it, 24 cycles with high-frequency cyclicity (average value 20.8 ky) were identified. From another section (M. Cerella), located approximately 15 km SSW of the Saracinesco one, a depositional sequence of the same hierarchical order has been compared with the Saracinesco section. The elementary sequences recognised in the two sections may be correlated and their calculated sea level cycles have the same period. The Fisher plots for the two sections, in terms of both stacking pattern and cycle frequency, show narrow analogies. The recorded high-frequency cyclicity can be related to Milankovitch-driven sea level fluctuations and the preliminary data on periodicity values obtained from spectral analysis are encouraging.",,

Examination of thin sections has yielded 34 species of foraminifera in five genus-level assemblages. The Lower Chikkim Member is about 55m thick; its basal portion is of Albian age based on the presence of Biticinella breggiensis and Planomalina buxtorfi.

This formation is one of the major Cretaceous oil reservoirs. It is composed mainly of calcarenitic limestone interbedded with marl and glauconitic sands. Its thickness ranges from almost zero in the south to about 100 m (328 ft) in the north. A total of 99 core samples were collected from six oil fields in Kuwait: Raudhatain, Sabiriyah and Bahra in the north, and from the Burgan, Ahmadi and Magwa in the south. Well logs from these fields (gamma ray GR, sonic, resistivity, density) were correlated and used in the study. The core samples were screened for the amount and nature of the organic matter by Rock-Eval 6 pyrolysis (RE6) using reservoir mode. A set of samples was selected to study the properties of the organic matter including the soluble and insoluble organic parts. The geochemical characterisation was performed using different methods. After organic solvent extraction of rock samples, the solvent soluble organic matter or bitumen was characterised in terms of saturates, aromatics and heavy compounds (resins and asphaltenes). Then the hydrocarbon distribution of saturates was studied using gas chromatography (GC/FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for tentative oil-source rock correlation. After mineral matrix destruction of previously extracted rocks, insoluble organic matter or kerogen was analysed for its elemental composition to identify kerogen type. The geology and the analytical results show similarities between the wells in the southern fields and the wells in the northern fields. Average Total Organic Matter (TOC) in the carbonate facies is 2.5 wt.% and the highest values (8.0 wt.%) are in the northern fields. The clastic intervals in the northern fields show higher total organic matter (1.3 wt.%) relative to the southern fields (0.6 wt.%). The total Production Index is higher in the carbonate (0.6) than the clastic section (0.3). This reflects the amount of extractable hydrocarbons, which are usually associated with the carbonate section in this formation, representing its reservoir section. Although the carbonate rocks are dominated by richer total organic matter, there are some intervals, with low total organic matter values (0.07 wt.%), representing its poor reservoir sections. The kerogen type varies between type II-III and III in the shales with a slightly better quality in the carbonate section. It is immature in almost all the studied fields. The composition of the rock extract has no relation with the rock type. Some sandstone show similar extract composition to the carbonate rocks in the reservoir intervals. The extracts from these intervals show different genetic nature than those in the shales. The maturity level in the reservoir extract is much higher than in the shale intervals. Thus, the oil accumulated in the reservoir might be largely related to migrated oil from a more mature source rock deposited in a clearly different environment than the associated shaly intervals.

In some areas, API monogram well cements have never been available, while in others, plants previously producing API well cements are choosing to drop such production. This lack of API well cement is forcing operators to consider using Non-API cements in applications beyond their previously recognized limits. While the use of ASTM construction cements in applications such as shallow/cool casings is not new, their migration of use into areas many consider HTHP applications, is new. Because they are not just ""re-named API well cements"", using Non-API cements in more rigorous applications presents significant new challenges. These include determining best slurry density, viscosity/gellation issues, thermal stability, physical response to current cementing additives, corrosion resistance, and reproducibility of data. To successfully apply non-API cements in more challenging environments requires moving beyond historical ""comfort areas"". Engineers must ask difficult questions, such as ""Why use slurry densities &gt; 15.0 ppg (1.8 s.g.) if not required for well control""?, or ""What strengths are really needed to provide isolation and casing support?"" Also of concern is if ASTM cements perform adequately at elevated temperatures. Answering these questions, and changing old paradigms on the way cements are designed, is the purpose of this paper. The authors provide information on optimum densities for ASTM cements replacing API Class ""H"", ""G"", and ""C"" cements. They also introduce new materials, allowing for mixability, performance and safe use of ASTM cements at temperatures &gt; 300oF (149°C).

Data will be presented to support conclusions illustrating thesuitability of these systems for applications previously deemed impossible and help change paradigms regarding the ability to successfully utilize non-API cements for use in more widespread critical applications. Introduction Although cementitious materials have been written about and used since the 1st century BC, it was not until 1824 that Portland cement, named after the Isle of Portland, was patented. The advent of modern day hydraulic cement, which sets by means of hydration in the presence of water and not by dehydration, was developed when English Engineer Joseph Aspdin blended limestone with various materials and heated them to produce the desired proportions of CaO, Al2O3, SiO2 and Fe2O3. Over a century later in 1940, the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) established specifications for five types of Portland cement: Type I, II, III, IV and V. Although the American Petroleum Institute (API) first established a committee to study oil well cements in 1936, it was not until 1952 whenthe first specification (API std. 10A) and recommended practices (RP 10B) were established1. Although the API has defined nine classes of cement, only Classes ""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""G"" and ""H"" are available from producers in the U. S2. These documents have gone through numerous changes and modifications over the years, but the basic premise of the original is still being used today. The raw material used to produce Portland cement is a blend of calcareous (sedimentary and metamorphic limestone) and argillaceous (clays, shale's, marls, etc.) minerals. These raw materials are finely ground and provide the main constituents of calcium, silica, aluminum and iron required to feed the kiln and produce the clinker. The clinker is then ground to obtain the finished Portland cement. Both ASTM and API well cement start with the same raw materials and undergo similar processes. As described by Myers3 there can be large variations in ASTM cement'schemical, physical and microscopic properties, not only from plant to plant, but also from day-to-day operations in the same plant. The same thing can be said for some API well cements.",,

The Mjolnir impact took place in the palaeoBarents Sea, close to the Volgian - Ryazanian boundary. The epicontinental sea had a water depth of 300 - 500 m, and was characterized by anoxic to hypoxic deposition of organic rich clays, presently with kerogen of types II and I. The bolide, about 1.5 - 2.0 km in size, hit the sea/sea floor and created the 40 km wide Mjolnir crater. The Ragnarok Formation is defined as the locally derived allochthonous (mixture of re-deposited excavated material, fall back ejecta and back wash material) to parautochthonous (structurally uplifted, slumped and inverted target material from deeper levels) breccia deposits that were formed during and immediately after the Mjolnir impact. The uppermost part of the formation has been cored by a stratigraphic drilling (7329/03-U-01). It comprises siliciclastic sediments from claystones to conglomerates and consists of chaotic slump and avalanche deposits, along with different mass flow deposits. The formation is normally overlain by shales and siltstones of the uppermost part of the Hekkingen Formation (Oxfordian -Berriasian), and are succeeded by marls of the Klippfisk Formation (Berriasian-Hauterivian). On seismic reflection profiles the Ragnarok Formation can reach thicknesses of 1.3 km, including uplifted, reworked Lower Triassic fragments which originated about 3.5 km down in the crust and were structurally elevated during the impact cratering stage. The Ragnarok Formation reaches its maximum thickness in a wedge-shaped annular trough beneath the present annular crater basin, pinching out both towards the crater centre and towards the periphery. It can be recognised in seismic reflection profiles at the Mjolnir crater location and up to similar to55 km away from the crater centre, forming a wedge-shaped unit within the Mesozoic siliciclastic deposits of the Bjarmeland Platform. During the oblique Mjolnir impact event, large amounts of material were ejected and widely dispersed. Models of the impact process suggest that the ejecta were mainly spread in a north-easterly direction. The impact-related ejecta bed outside the crater boundaries varies from millimetres to a few metres in thickness and has been named the Sindre Bed. It has been recognized in core 7430/10-U-01, and in other wells of the Barents Sea. An Ir-enrichment in a time-equivalent formation at Nordvik, North Central Siberia, possibly represents a distal variety of the Sindre Bed.",,

Zelilidis', 'org': 'University of Patras', 'orgs': ['University of Patras']}]","Abstract Intrabasinal basement highs and transfer faults, distance from source, and the underlying geology influence the drainage pattern and the evolution of the 41 river basins in the northern Peloponnesus. These rivers were classified as antecedent (10), multistory (17), re-established (5) and juvenile (9) drainage types. Antecedent drainage is when a river has maintained its original direction of flow across later tectonic topography. Multistory drainage consists of a re-established drainage and of a reverse drainage. Reverse drainage, when flow direction along part of a river is reversed, consists of two opposing drainage components: a misfit and a reverse element; the area between these two elements, termed “wind gap”, is a dry valley. Re-established drainage is when a reverse element returns to its original flow direction. Juvenile drainage consists of small incising and headward-eroding streams. The sediments that the rivers flow across (soft uncohesive marls or coarse-grained deposits and Pre-Neogene basement with limestones), river power (strong close to the source or weak far from the source), presence or absence of transfer faults and tilted blocks due to the activity of synthetic and antithetic faults, all influence whether an antecedent drainage will remain unchanged or will be changed to a reverse drainage. When transfer faults cross-cut the area of a wind gap and the underlying sediments were soft uncohesive marls, reverse drainage changed to a re-established drainage. In other cases, where transfer faults were absent and underlying deposits were coarse-grained sediments or limestones, in the area of the wind gap, then reverse drainage remained unchanged.",,

Faith'}, {'name': 'Charles D. Blome'}, {'name': 'Allan K. Clark'}, {'name': 'George B. Ozuna'}, {'name': 'Bruce D. Smith'}]","Helicopter electromagnetic (HEM) and magnetic surveys were flown in the Seco Creek area, (Medina and Uvalde Counties, TX, 2002) and in Northern Bexar County (TX, 2003). The purpose of these surveys was to map structure and lithology of the Edwards and Trinity aquifers consisting of the catchment zone (Glen Rose, Trinity Group), recharge zone (Devils River, Edwards Group), and confined zone. The latter survey concentrated on Camps Stanley and Bullis, which are located mostly on the Glenn Rose. The southern part of Camp Bullis includes the faulted contact between the Edwards Group (recharge zone) and the catchment (Glenn Rose). Ground geophysical surveys at Seco Creek, conducted by the USGS in April 2002, consisted of total field magnetics, dc resistivity and shallow terrain conductivity measurements. In May 2003, BEG (Bureau of Economic Geology) acquired ground electrical conductivity measurements at 379 locations. Re-mapping of the geology along the nine geophysical lines was done at the same time. The shallow ground conductivity interpretations were supplemented by time domain EM (TDEM) soundings by the USGS. Ground-based measurements demonstrate that (a) mapped geologic units consisting of Cretaceous age limestones and dolomitized limestones, marls, mudstones, shales, and Quaternary alluvial deposits have differences in apparent conductivity, (b) geologic structures such as faults and karst can have detectable apparent conductivity signatures, and (c) conductivity measurements can be combined with geologic maps and outcrop studies to identify hidden contacts, covered strata, and unmapped structural features. Limited comparisons of measurements confirm that the ground and airborne geophysical systems produce similar apparent electrical conductivities at comparable frequencies and coil orientation. The ground based geophysical surveys refine the airborne geophysical data, revealing greater structural complexity than depicted in the original geologic mapping. Ramp structures are well defined by the geophysical surveys including a large complexly breached ramp along Seco Creek. The airborne geophysical data indicate a distinct difference in electrical resistivity between the upper and lower Devils River formations in the recharge area. In addition the electrical data have been used to map the subsurface configuration of upper confining clay units (Del Rio and Eagle Ford). The Glenn Rose formation has a lower resistivity than the Edwards group formations. A previously unknown collapse feature in the study area is inferred from a high resistivity area along Seco Creek in the Trinity Aquifer. Geologic maps of four 7.5-minute quadrangles of the Seco Creek area have been digitized and revised based on the geophysical surveys. The geophysical data has been critical in the construction of a 3D geologic model of the study area because of deficient well data for subsurface information and the extent of colluvium hiding near surface structures and bedrock. Ground geophysical surveys can capture small-scale lateral electrical conductivity changes, complementing smoothed but spatially dense airborne electrical conductivity measurements. Airborne surveys cover large areas that are inaccessible or impractical to survey using ground-based instruments. They also provide aerial detail of the subsurface not available from photo-geologic and other near-surface mapping methods.",,

The phosphorites of Naqib Etaiq area (Campanian-Maastrichtian in age), crops out along the southeastern extension of Ras En Naqab-Batn Al Ghul escarpment, are up to 26 m thick and unconformably overlies the Upper Cretaceous-Batn Al Ghul Group. The phosphorites at this locality are composed of predominantly phosphatic sand, sandstone, phosphate, interbedded with thin limestone beds, coquinal limestone, coquina, marl, phosphatic chert and chert. The phosphate sequence in the study area shows lateral variations in lithology, thickness and distribution of the phosphate beds. Generally, phosphates at these localities form approximately 50% of the section and occur as beds, up to 1.7 m thick. Field observations indicate the presence of fragmented bones, reptile carapaces, Thalassinoides, gastropods, bivalves. Chemical analyses indicate that P2O5 content of the phosphate beds increased upward in the section and varies from 8.0 to 26.42%, whereas through SEM on selected phosphate areas the P2O5 is up to 42.13%. The results of X-ray diffraction analyses indicate that the main phosphatic mineral is carbonate fluorapatite (francolite). Preliminary petrographic studies indicate the presence of phosphate pellets, bone fragments, intraclasts, fish teeth, and quartz grains cemented by calcite and dolomite. The phosphorites in the study area were probably deposited in marine environment, upper shoreface, very close to the shore lines of the continent.

These tools are able to collect large amount of data at multiple depths thus helping to quantify changes in rock and fluid properties along the wellbore, to define hydraulic flow units, and to understand the reservoir architecture. A key input into the planning of wireline formation tester operations is an accurate understanding of the subsurface lithology, including subtle reservoir internal baffles and barriers. Not only is it necessary to understand where, in depth, the zones of interest exist, but also their compositions. Log-derived high-resolution mineral-based lithofacies can be used to improve the planning of downhole sampling operations and post-operational analysis. These are computed using borehole spectroscopy and high-resolution micro-resistivity image data. The spectroscopy data is used to classify the rocks into dry-weight mineralogy-based lithofacies based on a specifically designed ternary-diagram classification system. Calibrated high-resolution micro-resistivity image data is integrated with the generated dry-weight mineralogy-based lithofacies to compute a final mineral-based high-resolution set of lithofacies. All the computations can be accomplished on a workstation within a short time. The final lithofacies can be presented as a detailed geological column, or be input, as numerical data, for additional computation and modeling. These lithofacies can be used to make sampling and pressure point selections. The speed of computation makes them useable for this purpose. The output can be quickly delivered to the decision makers whether in the office or at a remote location. The geological display of the lithofacies makes it readily usable and preferred for choosing sampling locations, whether for pressure or fluids. The inherent mineralogical content combined with the higher resolution bedding directly addresses the need to identify potential zones of interest otherwise indistinguishable. Critical depositional events such as maximum flooding surfaces, condensed sections, reservoir seals such as marl layers and shales, continuous or interbedded, are immediately identifiable with these lithofacies. The use of log-derived high-resolution mineral-based lithofacies helps place the tool probes and/or packers at optimum formation and depth locations, thereby reducing risk and operating time, easing interpretation, and maximizing data and sample recovery. Introduction As global exploration proceeds to deeper waters and more challenging targets, increasingly more complex rocks and fluids are encountered. It is, therefore, becoming ever more requisite to clearly understand the sub-seismic details of the reservoir. In recent years, wireline formation testers (WFT) have become the default methodology for collecting formation fluid samples previously obtained only from drillstem (DST) or production tests. Pressure testing, sampling, and identification of compartmentalization are of critical importance to reservoir development. Traditional methods of sampling and compartment identification such as drill stem tests and extended well tests often become impractical in deep water settings with costs approaching the costs of new wells and emissions becoming increasingly undesirable. In order to collect representative fluid samples and to decipher the connectivity of compartments, downhole pressure and gradients, downhole fluid analysis, sampling and vertical interference testing are being relied on more and more. In comparison to other tests, downhole sampling operations are easier to plan, and require less lead-time. Wireline formation testers are highly selective, allowing a series of reservoirs to be tested during a single trip into the well. Samples can be taken at low drawdown pressure for greater control, ensuring the sampling process itself minimally disturbs the physical characteristics and phase behavior of the fluid. Other advantages include reduced HSE (health, safety and environment) risks, the reduced need for equipment and personnel, and the lower overall costs.",,

Silicon optical platform applications, where a laser diode is aligned to a single mode fiber or an optical waveguide, then soldered to a substrate, require post-bonding alignments better than 1 um for optimum device performance.Several methods have been investigated to meet such stringent alignment requirements, ranging from active alignment of a powered device to various forms of passive self-aligned soldering methods employing one or more mechanical stops. Though these methods have demonstrated some good results, the active alignment method incurs substantial cost of assembly time, while some self-aligning methods carry the disadvantage of requiring additional process steps during chip and substrate fabrication, as well as generating more sporadic alignment results under typical manufacturing variations.A fresh approach to this alignment problem is proposed, where the mechanical alignment and placement burdens are borne by the robotic placement machine.

Barton'}]","Carlin-type deposits are major sources of gold, yet their origins are enigmatic. Suggested genetic models make connections to magmatism, regional metamorphism, or regional extension. Depositional mechanisms are uncertain as well. We propose on the basis of geologic, physical, and chemical reasoning, a genetic model in which meteoric fluids were circulated by heat released during crustal extension. These fluids interacted at depth with the sedimentary rock pile and scavenged gold. Upon upwelling, these fluids interacted with various lithologies and/or other fluids and produced the characteristic alteration and metal suites of these deposits. To test the viability of this amagmatic model, we have investigated certain physical and chemical constraints implicit to the model. Heat balance calculations indicate that ample surface waters could be heated to appropriate temperatures and circulated during rapid crustal extension. Mass balance calculations indicate that solution transport efficiencies of < 10 percent can account for-several times the amount of known alteration and mineralization. In contrast, magma-driven or metamorphic fluids appear to be less adequate sources. A two-step, source to deposit approach was used to simulate fluid-rock interaction and mass transport implied in the amagmatic model. Fluids with a fixed Sigma Cl were first equilibrated with various potential source rocks (arkose, graywacke, and pelite, each with various f(O2) and f(S2) buffer assemblages) at 300 degrees C and 1 kbar to simulate reaction at depth, perhaps near the brittle-ductile transition. These fluids were then reequilibrated under conditions indicated for deposit formation (225 degrees-150 degrees C, 0.5 kbars) to investigate processes including cooling, wall-rock reaction, and mixing which could be important to ore deposition. Gold transport was favored for low-chlorinity, intermediate oxidation state (below pyrrhotite-pyrite-magnetite), slightly acid fluids from sulfide-bearing sources (i.e., equilibration with arkosic rocks). These conditions are not conducive to base metal transport and explain the rarity of base metals in Carlin-type systems. When reacted under deposit level conditions, these calculated ore fluids leach carbonate and deposit quartz. The volume ratio of carbonate dissolved to quartz precipitated is similar to 0.2 to 2.5, and increases when mixing with a second fluid is considered. Arkose-equilibrated source fluids can precipitate gold by combinations of wall-rock reaction with a decarbonated host, mixing with various sulfide-poor fluids, and reaction with iron-rich host rocks. Cooling alone is ineffective over this temperature interval. Although most deposits are hosted by decarbonated marls, geochemical calculations suggest that other depositional environments are feasible, consistent with observation. Although here applied to the amagmatic hypothesis, these chemical calculations are not mechanism specific and might also be appropriate to metamorphic or magma-driven hydrothermal systems. These results demonstrate that Carlin-type deposits can result from the coincidence of all effective driving force (rapid, major crustal extension), a source of dilute fluids, and chemically appropriate sets of both source and host rocks. The aqueous chemistry involved is unexceptional and shares many features with other types of moderate-to low-temperature gold-bearing hydrothermal systems-it is the geologic setting, and perhaps the fluid driving force, that is unusual. An amagmatic model is consistent with both deposit-scale and regional-scale observations; it rationalizes Carlin-type systems in the framework of southwestern North American metallogeny and it implies multiple possible mechanisms for gold mineralization. Detachment-type gold systems may be the high-oxidation state, high-salinity analogues of Carlin-type systems, formed by major extension, but from contrasting lithologic and fluid sources.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/E1/77/59/E17759EB939FE34F6CACC93A378BB2FB.pdf

This formation is one of the major Cretaceous oil reservoirs. It is composed mainly of calcarenitic limestone interbedded with marl and glauconitic sands. Its thickness ranges from almost zero in the south to about 100 m (328 ft) in the north. A total of 99 core samples were collected from six oil fields in Kuwait: Raudhatain, Sabiriyah and Bahra in the north, and from the Burgan, Ahmadi and Magwa in the south. Well logs from these fields (gamma ray GR, sonic, resistivity, density) were correlated and used in the study. The core samples were screened for the amount and nature of the organic matter by Rock-Eval 6 pyrolysis (RE6) using reservoir mode. A set of samples was selected to study the properties of the organic matter including the soluble and insoluble organic parts. The geochemical characterisation was performed using different methods. After organic solvent extraction of rock samples, the solvent soluble organic matter or bitumen was characterised in terms of saturates, aromatics and heavy compounds (resins and asphaltenes). Then the hydrocarbon distribution of saturates was studied using gas chromatography (GC/FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for tentative oil-source rock correlation. After mineral matrix destruction of previously extracted rocks, insoluble organic matter or kerogen was analysed for its elemental composition to identify kerogen type.The geology and the analytical results show similarities between the wells in the southern fields and the wells in the northern fields. Average Total Organic Matter (TOC) in the carbonate facies is 2.5 wt.% and the highest values (8.0 wt.%) are in the northern fields. The clastic intervals in the northern fields show higher total organic matter (1.3 wt.%) relative to the southern fields (0.6 wt.%). The total Production Index is higher in the carbonate (0.6) than the clastic section (0.3). This reflects the amount of extractable hydrocarbons, which are usually associated with the carbonate section in this formation, representing its reservoir section. Although the carbonate rocks are dominated by richer total organic matter, there are some intervals, with low total organic matter values (0.07 wt.%), representing its poor reservoir sections. The kerogen type varies between type II-III and III in the shales with a slightly better quality in the carbonate section. It is immature in almost all the studied fields.The composition of the rock extract has no relation with the rock type. Some sandstone show similar extract composition to the carbonate rocks in the reservoir intervals. The extracts from these intervals show different genetic nature than those in the shales. The maturity level in the reservoir extract is much higher than in the shale intervals. Thus, the oil accumulated in the reservoir might be largely related to migrated oil from a more mature source rock deposited in a clearly different environment than the associated shaly intervals.

Here, we present new magnelostratigraphic and biostratigraphic results from sections on eastern Crete (Faneromeni), central Crete (Kastelli) and western Crete (Potamida and Skouloudhiana) supplemented by cyclostratigraphic data. The recently developed geomagnetic polarity time scale (CK92) of Cande and Kent [2] allows an unambiguous correlation of the polarity sequences on Crete.

A slightly modified version of CK92-if we use more recent age estimates-provides an age of 7.10 Ma and a duration of 1.78 Myr, respectively. Bipartite sedimentary cycles are distinctly present in the Cretan sections studied. Assuming that these cycles are precession-induced and using an average periodicity of 21.7 kyr enables us to independently estimate the duration of the successive individual polarity zones.

The basins have a similar geological setting: in the Sillaro basin, however, clays represent the dominant feature; in the Lavino basin, sandstone and clay marl are widely present; and the main part of the Savena watershed is characterised by sandrock, pebbly sandstone and clay marts. These differences are recognisable in the particle size distribution of the suspended sediment samples collected in these basins. The aim of this work is to estimate the SSCs of river water samples with two indirect methods, turbidity measurement and free settleable solids in Imhoff cones, and the relations with suspended sediment concentration and particle size distribution. Alongside these investigations, laboratory analyses were performed in order to validate these methods under controlled conditions. The turbidity measurements were highly significant, but their reliability was influenced by the concentration and the particle size distribution. In order to estimate the SSCs, it was necessary to establish specific regression curves for each stream. The estimate of the SSC obtained through a free settleable solids analysis was not only reliable but also less sensitive to sample characteristics. The measure of the settleable solids after 1 and 24 h presented a constant relationship in all the samples from the three streams, due to the compaction of the sediment. The measure of the settleable solids after 24 h gave a better estimate of the SSC. This last method was shown to be inexpensive, fast. reliable and applicable to all the situations studied.

We defined three major stages: - Upper Miocene: the Sais is a foreland deep marine basin located at the southern limit of Pre-Rif during its uplift. The sequence includes more than 1 km of marls with interbedded turbidite sands. The structural style analysis shows that NE and NW extensional faults are responsible for graben formation towards the Sais basin centre. This extensional system is contemporary with an advance towards the south of preriffian ridges ramps existing in the northern part of basin. The simultaneity of the extensive and compressive structures is typical of the foreland basins. The last marine deposits in the Sais basin are littoral and paradeltaic sandy marls. The ultimate filling in Sais basin, of Lower and Middle Pliocene age, is due to the marine regression in the South riffian basin. Upper Pliocene evolution: the Sais basin, thus filled, formed a continental basin corresponding to a simple stage on profile of the Sebou palaeoriver. We define the discharge system of PalaeoSebou in the eastern part of basin near Fez. Sedimentation is dominated by conglomerates of fluvial origin on the edges of the basin; it is evaporatic and lacustrine carbonate towards the basin centre. The climate was hot and humid. The northern part of the basin shows a syntectonic character expressed by flexural faults that affected the fluvial conglomerates. This deformation reflects an episode of mobilization of the preriffain ridges ramp of Tghat and Zalagh. Quaternary evolution: The culmination of Sais area is made by the progress of preriffian ramp who overrides on Pliocene deposits of the northern edge of Sais. The preriffian ridges migrate towards the south by Zalagh, Sebou and Sidi Hrazem ramps. The southern riffian front ""FSR"" towards the south in the plain reorganized a change of course of the Sebou palaeoriver. This deformation translates NS to NNW-SSE compressional strain and allows reactivation of the preexisting Miocene structures and the neo-formation of new structures. A change in the evolution of Sais results also of major neotectonic reactivation of the flexures of North Middle Atlas. This new structural state allows the rise of the Sais who becomes elevated plain related to the northern middle atlasic catchment basin. Sais Pliocene formations and their Miocene substrate are subjected to intense erosion whith fluvial incisions exceeding 100 m. Currently, the Sais plain corresponds to the median part of the Sebou catchment basin located between the middle Atlas upstream and Prerif downstream. This last paroxysmal strain has been also described in the Pre-Rif (Faugeres, 1978; Ait Brahim & Chotin, 1983; Chalouan et al., 2000, 2003) and in the south of Middle Atlas (Charroud 2002; Charroud et al., 2006). It is interpreted as being the result of the crustal readjustment under Alboran, Rif and Atlas (Frizon de Lamotte et al., 2004), where shoshonitic volcanism produced in the eastern external Betico-Riffian zones is replaced by the alkaline volcanism (Calvert et al., 2000). The role of crustal readjustment to explain the culmination of Sais is proven for atlasic chain (Teixell et al., 2003; Arboleya et al., 2004; Ayarza et al., 2005).",,

Zelilidis', 'org': 'University of Patras', 'orgs': ['University of Patras']}]","Abstract Intrabasinal basement highs and transfer faults, distance from source, and the underlying geology influence the drainage pattern and the evolution of the 41 river basins in the northern Peloponnesus. These rivers were classified as antecedent (10), multistory (17), re-established (5) and juvenile (9) drainage types. Antecedent drainage is when a river has maintained its original direction of flow across later tectonic topography. Multistory drainage consists of a re-established drainage and of a reverse drainage. Reverse drainage, when flow direction along part of a river is reversed, consists of two opposing drainage components: a misfit and a reverse element; the area between these two elements, termed “wind gap”, is a dry valley. Re-established drainage is when a reverse element returns to its original flow direction. Juvenile drainage consists of small incising and headward-eroding streams. The sediments that the rivers flow across (soft uncohesive marls or coarse-grained deposits and Pre-Neogene basement with limestones), river power (strong close to the source or weak far from the source), presence or absence of transfer faults and tilted blocks due to the activity of synthetic and antithetic faults, all influence whether an antecedent drainage will remain unchanged or will be changed to a reverse drainage. When transfer faults cross-cut the area of a wind gap and the underlying sediments were soft uncohesive marls, reverse drainage changed to a re-established drainage. In other cases, where transfer faults were absent and underlying deposits were coarse-grained sediments or limestones, in the area of the wind gap, then reverse drainage remained unchanged.",,

Moustakas'}]","Red soils in Greece are distributed throughout the country, but they occur more frequently in the southern provinces and constitute important soil resources supporting several land utilization types. They can be grouped into two categories: the autochthonous and the allochthonous. The former soils are found on hard Limestone and on basic igneous rocks in sloping mountainous or hilly landscapes. Moreover, they can be found on mica schists and gneisses in locations adjacent to marble or calcareous mica schists. Allochthonous red soils are wide-spread on late Tertiary and Pleistocene surfaces in the lowlands. Many of these deep deposits have red strata, a few decimeters to several meters thick, or red-colored and fine-textured layers interbedded with light colored deposits of marl, or conglomerates and also with thick strata enriched with calcareous concretions. They are distributed in the thermo- and mese-mediterranean bioclimatic zones. These sites have a common feature, the gently sloping terrain that ensures efficient drainage. There are some differences in chemical and physical properties and in the clay mineralogy of the two groups of Greek red soils. Palygorskite is present in some soils developed on basic rocks; the clay minerals of the allochthonous soils on Pleistocene and late Pliocene seems to be mixed with micas in significant amounts. Soil forming factors required for the formation of red soils are: (a) parent material containing iron-bearing minerals, and rich in bases, (b) slope gradients and/or water permeabilities of the bed-rock securing excessive drainage and (c) vegetation cover that does not produce high amounts of, and deeply distributed organic matter. The allochthonous red soils have likely inherited their color from their parent materials that were transported from the originally formed residual soils on hard limestone. The soils retain the red color in the thermo-mediterranean zone only on sloping terrains. The soils on these landscapes are frequently stratified. The Greek red soils belong to the great groups of: Rhodoxeralfs, Palexeralfs, Xerochrepts, Orthents. Large portions of the allochthonous soils have been desertified or have been severely degraded and their extensive exploitation is not recommended. Soil management practices applied in the allochthonous soils include erosion control, preserva-tion of organic matter, minimum tillage, split application of nitrogen using non-acidifying fertilizers, irrigation, soil water conservation and sheltered agriculture.",,

The oil field (named PBR) is located offshore Brazil. The PBR reservoir consists of a complex lithology, including mainly turbiditic sandstones interbedded by shales and marls. The workflow of the PBR reservoir modeling from the geostatistical lithofacies model, built using the non-stationary truncated gaussian method, to the flow model (about 24000 active cells) has been implemented in a fully integrated chain. The field was considered in this hypothetical study at its appraisal stage. Main challenge consisted in selecting an optimal water injection scheme to maximize oil production while minimizing water production and maintaining pressure over the 15 years of production, taking into account the overall major sources of uncertainties in the reservoir. Advanced risk analysis methods were used with the following objectives:–Determine the impact of the main uncertainties on the field production forecasts versus time and versus geographical locations of production and injection wells–Optimize the water injection phase to maintain pressure over time, while producing maximum oil and minimum water in a 15-years period.–Quantify the impact of main uncontrollable reservoir uncertainties on production forecasts and fluid distribution maps versus time for the optimal water injection program selected in order to identify potential risks with non-drained zones and pressure drops. At each step, either classical or optimal experimental designs were used to be able to perform an accurate analysis at a minimum cost in terms of reservoir simulation and interpretation. Results show that this innovative methodology can be successfully applied on complex real cases to quantify the risk associated with the main reservoir uncertainties during production forecasts and to optimize the water injection. In particular, this example illustrates how some innovative interpretation tools can be combined with experimental design methodology to perform advanced risk analysis for reservoir management. Introduction Evaluation and optimization of petroleum field has become a much more accurate process in the last decades. Thanks to high technology data acquisition programs, it is nowadays possible to calibrate complex numerical models that integrate all this information. However, these data are generally associated with significant errors, at any step from the data acquisition itself, its processing, interpretation and integration. All these uncertainties finally lead to a complex reservoir modeling which enables to take into account the different physical phenomena that occur in the reservoir but which are populated by a very large number of uncertain parameters. The main consequence is that the outputs of this reservoir modeling workflow, for instance fluid in places, reserves, production profiles, economic evaluation, etc, will be uncertain. All those uncertainties may have a significant impact on production and economic forecasts as well as on the optimization of the field development plan, and therefore should be handled to optimize the decision making process.

The ammonites of this genus inhabited the shelf seas around the edges of the Tehtys Ocean from the Late Bathonian to the earliest Middle Callovian. In Iran Macrocephalites is rather rare, we only know a dozen of localities in the North Iran (Alborz and Binalud mountains) and Central Iran. Most of the specimens come from the locality named Talu near Damghan in the eastern Alborz, from the marls and limestones of the Dalichai Formation. The Macrocephalites fauna of Talu seem to belong to the middle part of the Bullatus Zone (Lower Callovian). Further collections from localities in Binalud, Koppeh Dagh and Tabas areas indicate horizons of other ages. Thus, a sequence of 8 ammonite assemblages can be proposed for the Upper Bathonian and Lower Callovian of Iran. In Iran Macrocephalites is only frequent in the Bullatus Zone, but also occurs in the Prahecquense Subzone. Only a single Macrocephalites was found in the Gracilis Zone at Kelariz. The Macrocephalites gracilis fauna, which is typical of the middle Gracilis Zone, and the M. opis-semilaevis fauna from the Lower-Middle Callovian boundary seems to be absent in Iran.

Faith'}, {'name': 'Charles D. Blome'}, {'name': 'Allan K. Clark'}, {'name': 'George B. Ozuna'}, {'name': 'Bruce D. Smith'}]","Helicopter electromagnetic (HEM) and magnetic surveys were flown in the Seco Creek area, (Medina and Uvalde Counties, TX, 2002) and in Northern Bexar County (TX, 2003). The purpose of these surveys was to map structure and lithology of the Edwards and Trinity aquifers consisting of the catchment zone (Glen Rose, Trinity Group), recharge zone (Devils River, Edwards Group), and confined zone. The latter survey concentrated on Camps Stanley and Bullis, which are located mostly on the Glenn Rose. The southern part of Camp Bullis includes the faulted contact between the Edwards Group (recharge zone) and the catchment (Glenn Rose). Ground geophysical surveys at Seco Creek, conducted by the USGS in April 2002, consisted of total field magnetics, dc resistivity and shallow terrain conductivity measurements. In May 2003, BEG (Bureau of Economic Geology) acquired ground electrical conductivity measurements at 379 locations. Re-mapping of the geology along the nine geophysical lines was done at the same time. The shallow ground conductivity interpretations were supplemented by time domain EM (TDEM) soundings by the USGS. Ground-based measurements demonstrate that (a) mapped geologic units consisting of Cretaceous age limestones and dolomitized limestones, marls, mudstones, shales, and Quaternary alluvial deposits have differences in apparent conductivity, (b) geologic structures such as faults and karst can have detectable apparent conductivity signatures, and (c) conductivity measurements can be combined with geologic maps and outcrop studies to identify hidden contacts, covered strata, and unmapped structural features. Limited comparisons of measurements confirm that the ground and airborne geophysical systems produce similar apparent electrical conductivities at comparable frequencies and coil orientation. The ground based geophysical surveys refine the airborne geophysical data, revealing greater structural complexity than depicted in the original geologic mapping. Ramp structures are well defined by the geophysical surveys including a large complexly breached ramp along Seco Creek. The airborne geophysical data indicate a distinct difference in electrical resistivity between the upper and lower Devils River formations in the recharge area. In addition the electrical data have been used to map the subsurface configuration of upper confining clay units (Del Rio and Eagle Ford). The Glenn Rose formation has a lower resistivity than the Edwards group formations. A previously unknown collapse feature in the study area is inferred from a high resistivity area along Seco Creek in the Trinity Aquifer. Geologic maps of four 7.5-minute quadrangles of the Seco Creek area have been digitized and revised based on the geophysical surveys. The geophysical data has been critical in the construction of a 3D geologic model of the study area because of deficient well data for subsurface information and the extent of colluvium hiding near surface structures and bedrock. Ground geophysical surveys can capture small-scale lateral electrical conductivity changes, complementing smoothed but spatially dense airborne electrical conductivity measurements. Airborne surveys cover large areas that are inaccessible or impractical to survey using ground-based instruments. They also provide aerial detail of the subsurface not available from photo-geologic and other near-surface mapping methods.",,

Assemblages characterized by high abundances of non-calcareous agglutinates (A and E) have low numbers of planktics and are associated with cold-water pulse faunas of mid Russian affinity (belemnites, brachiopods and bivalves). These are interpreted as representing a cold North Sea watermass. Assemblages characterized by high abundances of planktics (B and C) are associated with pulse faunas that lack cold-water elements and are interpreted as representing a warm watermass. The foraminiferal assemblages are also related to sea-level fluctuations and individual assemblages were probably depth controlled. The assemblages can, therefore, be used to construct a sea-level curve and this agrees with the placement of critical sequence stratigraphic surfaces (e.g. sequence boundaries and flooding surfaces).",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/BC/79/7E/BC797E8A73A146F3A4FFFAE0406EEF8D.pdf

In the deep subsurface, the gravel unconformably overlies gently folded lacustrine sediments. Within the lacustrine sediments, a bed of sheared, unoxidized clay overlies a marl bed, forming a distinctive marker bed couplet. Structure contours on this marker bed show an anticline and a syncline in the vicinity of the quarry. These northwest-striking folds are aligned parallel to regional Quaternary fold and thrust belt structures. Where the marker bed dips toward the pit, slope inclinometers consistently deflected toward the pit at the depth of the unoxidized clay. Where the marker bed dips away from the quarry pit, no slope inclinometer deflections were recorded. Thus, slope instability was controlled by the site stratigraphy, geologic structure, and the location of quarry slopes relative to that geologic structure. High pore-water pressures within the unoxidized clay also contributed to slope instability. Shearing of the unoxidized clay occurred prior to excavation of the quarry pit, and the resulting low residual strength of this high-plasticity clay made it particularly vulnerable to incipient landsliding when lateral confinement was removed during excavation of the quarry pit. Analysis of the critical region between the quarry pit and the anticline axis showed that the static factor of safety remained below 1.5. Seismic displacement analyses indicated that moderate to large displacements would be anticipated. Thus, depressurization wells and an earth-fill buttress were designed and implemented to mitigate deep-seated slope instability.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/C7/97/59/C7975903AABB8F77DE484C53A9C0DB9E.pdf

Some require technology, such as hardware that scans paper documents and converts images to digital files; others require only a process change, such as asking clients to send their data as digital files rather than as paper documents. * Only 38% of firms prepared invoices directly on the computer in 2003 rather than on paper, using typical billing sheets--even though it would be far simpler and faster. In 2005 the number rose to 46%. * In a somewhat more technically advanced procedure, 72% used intranets to store firmwide information (such as personnel and procedure manuals) in 2005, up from 64% in 2003. * On average, firms of 100+ CPAs rated not much better than smaller firms in 2003. But the 100+ group showed a significant gain two years later. * The number of firms that stored audit workpapers in paperless software applications--a key sign of a paperless CPA office--showed a huge 103% growth last year over 2003. ********** OK, you regularly scan your clients' tax returns and store them electronically You even use your computer to prepare invoices, which you e-marl to clients. So your office is paperless, right? Think again. Although you do deserve to be commended for overcoming the initial resistance to converting some of your office operations, don't get too satisfied. You still have a long way to go before you're ready to declare your office paperless and start chalking up significant operating savings. A PAPERLESS GAIN To assess how far you've advanced toward a paperless model, compare your office with CPA firms of similar size that responded to surveys conducted by the Association for Accounting Administrators (AAA) in 2003 and again last year (see the exhibit below and online at www.aicpa. org/pubs/jofa/may2006/zarowin.htm). The AAA sent its initial survey to its 600 members, and of the 140 who responded, 51% said they had implemented at least some of the 21 paperless functions asked about in the survey When the AAA repeated the survey, it added four functions and the use rate rose to 67%--a 22% improvement. Lacking any other comprehensive measure of the rate of paperless growth, consider those figures an index of how CPAs are using less paper and more technology. Applying some technology to a few office functions is hardly enough to justify calling your office paperless. A true paperless office has not only added new technology, it's redesigned many manual processes so the technology and the revised processes work together to speed and enhance office operations. Some functions require new hardware, such as a scanner to convert paper-document images to digital code; others require only a process change, such as asking clients to send their data as digital files rather than as documents. Let's look at some of the processes the AAA included in the surveys. Firms that responded affirmatively to most of the queries can be considered nearly paperless. We'll begin with those functions that are the easiest to implement--requiring no technology, only changes in mind-set to take first steps into a paperless revolution. STILL USE BILLING SHEETS Firms were asked whether they prepared invoices directly on the computer rather than having someone in the firm prepare them on paper, using typical billing sheets. In the 2003 survey, only 38% used the computer--even though it would have been far simpler and faster that way. When the survey was repeated in 2005, use of the computer for billing rose to 46%--a 21% gain. But in last year's survey, only 27% said they then delivered those electronically prepared invoices to the client via email or digital fax. So instead of using a few mouse dicks, 73% actually addressed an envelope, inserted the invoice, stamped it and mailed it. …",,

Tectonic controls on basin geometry and drainage systems are well established, as are the effects of relative base level change, but climatic controls have been considered only for continental basins and the ways in which the relief and geology of the hinterland influence sedimentation have received little attention. A study of Oligo-Miocene sediments in the Gulf of Aden illustrates the need to take into account the geology and geomorphology of the rift flanks when considering the supply of detritus to the rift basin. It is also shown that climate is an important factor in controlling the facies distributions in marginal marine environments in rift settings. Rifting in the Gulf of Aden commenced in the Oligocene and continued until a passive margin developed in the late Miocene. Syn-rift deposits exposed in a coastal strip east of Mukalla in eastern Yemen can be divided into two sequences separated by an angular unconformity. Sequence 1 occurs unconformably on pre-rift limestones and includes localised alluvial fan deposits, algal limestones and gypsiferous sediments formed in evaporitic mudflats. Sequence 2 is more widespread and up to 1500 m thick: it comprises sandy to pebbly braided river deposits, lagoonal marls, localised patch reef limestones and extensive coastal sabkha deposits. Towards the end of Sequence 2, lateral facies variations were controlled by individual fault blocks which compartmentalised sedimentation. The predominance of fine-grained coastal plain and shallow marine facies suggests that there was little coarse clastic supply from the rift flank. This was partly a consequence of limited uplift of the rift shoulder and also the hinterland bedrock which, being largely Palaeogene carbonate rocks, supplied a low proportion of coarse bedload to the basin. A semi-arid to arid palaeoclimate resulted in widespread, syn-rift coastal evaporate deposits. This case study from the Gulf of Aden shows that a comprehensive framework for the analysis of sedimentation in extensional basins should include a consideration of the palaeoclimate, hinterland bedrock and rift flank relief as well as tectonic and base level controls.",,

The aim of this research was to map regional background geochemical patterns based on pristine or at least pre-industrial overbank samples and to deduce regional information on the degree of environmental pollution of floodplain and present-day river sediments. Over the entire study area (about 33,000 km2), 66 overbank sites have been sampled. Catchment areas range between 60 and 600 km2. At each site an overbank profile has been dug out in the immediate vicinity of the river and described in detail. A first composite sample was taken 5–25 cm below the surface. This sample is supposed to represent deposition over the last centuries. Human interferences in this interval are often inferable based on changed sedimentary characteristics and the presence of anthropogenic particles such as charcoal, slags and brick fragments. A second composite sample was taken at depth, usually >1.5 m below the surface over an interval of about 20 cm. In most sites, the profile characteristics allowed to assume pre-industrial or even pristine conditions for this lower overbank sample. In some profiles this was confirmed by 14C-dating and/or by the absence of anthropogenic particles. Finally, a present-day stream sediment was sampled on the site to infer the actual pollution status. After drying at 80°C, disaggregation and sieving, the <125 μm fractions of the three sediment samples were analysed by XRF for major elements and several trace elements. Lower overbank samples generally show a direct link with the geological substrate and allow to assess natural background concentrations. Results from the mapping exercise as well as from the statistical analyses display a clear contrast between the northern part of Belgium where Cenozoic unconsolidated sandy and silty formations dominate which are especially vulnerable for erosion, and the southern part of Belgium and Luxembourg where Paleozoic and Mesozoic sandstones, carbonates, marls and shales are the prevalent lithologies. Here the shales are the most intensively eroded lithologies. This is especially reflected in the element patterns of Al2O3, MgO, K2O, Ga, Ni, Rb, Sc and V which negatively correlate with SiO2. Despite the human related pollution, the geological contrast between north and south Belgium is still recognisable in the geochemical pattern of the upper overbank and present-day stream sediment samples for the above-mentioned elements. Furthermore there is a clear increase in heavy metal contents (Zn, Cd, Pb, Cu), As and in certain locations in Ba from the lower to the upper overbank sediment, as well as to the present-day stream sediment. The relative increase in element content allows to assess the degree of pollution and helps to define those drainage areas where more detailed research is needed.",,

Both studies realized on the border of the Bekrit-Timahdite syncline and the Iguer Awragh-Afennourir syncline, allow to specify the stratigraphy, the spatial distribution of deposits and to reconsider the paleogeographic organization of this ""border"" in the integral context of the northern Middle Atlas trough during the Toarcian and the lower Bajocian interval. A lithostratigraphic succession of the ""Couches du Selloum"" raised in the western part of Bekrit-Timahdite syncline shows the superposition of three units. Unit 1 is made of clay, reddish and gray marl, locally gypseous, assigned to the lower Toarcian. Unit 2 is essentially composed of a subnodular calcareous series, which consists of discontinuous, wavy and upward-thickening beds. The upper offshore is the most frequent environment. It is mainly made of crinoidal calcarenites, yielding some ammonites and brachiopods rich levels. The Middle Toarcian (Bifrons zone and Gradata zone) was identified in the lower part of this unit. Most of the upper Toarcian zones were distinguished (Speciosum zone, Meneghinii zone and Aalensis zone), they are represented in the upper part by brachiopods (Stroudithyris) and ammonites (Hammatoceras, Dumortieria and Catulloceras) rich set. On several lateral sections, the uppermost part of these pseudo nodular limestones is dated from Opalinum zone (levels with Leioceras and Tmetoceras). Unit 3 shows several facies: bioclastic calcarenites arranged in decimetrics beds, showing cross stratifications; microsparitic limestones in thick beds with silexites. The macrofauna is scarce, often represented by some crinoidal and mollusks fragments; some Zoophycos appear in the top bed of the set. The following deposits illustrate the evolution from the shoreface to the upper offshore. This unit is overlain by a sedimentary discontinuity, materialized by a boring surface, some pockets of accumulations with belemnites and a cover of ferruginous nodules. Ammonites drowned on the discontinuity surface or in the basis of the first interbedded marls which overlies this surface sign the Aalenian-Bajocian transition (top of the Concavum zone and the basis of Discites zone). Immediately above we found some index fauna of the Laeviuscula zone. The series overlaying the ""Couches du Selloum"" comprises thinning up alternations of limestone/marl, passing progressively to the ""Marnes de Boulmane"" Formation. Lateral variations and interpretations; SW to NE variations: The thickness and facies variations observed in the Bekrit-Timahdite syncline (C1 to C9), denote the existence of marine intervals generally more dilated, with some marly deposits developed towards the SW; on the contrary towards the NE, series are exclusively calcareous, reduced in thickness, and often condensed in their upper part. The same evolution is observed between the deposits of the Iguer Awragh syncline to the SW and those of Afennourir in the NE [Benshili et al., 1999]. SE to NW variations: Some observations realized in a Toarcian-Aalenian outcrop recently discovered in the sector of Outghalline (C11), shows that an uplifted area separates the marly basin of Bekrit from the Iguer Awragh one. Such variations denote a partition of the Toarcian Selloum basin, located in south west of the Middle Atlas trough, into several entities which are regrouped under the denomination of ""Blocks of Selloum""; two NE-SW trending notably subsiding gutters are recognized, the Iguer Awragh-Afennourir and the Bekrit-Timahdite, separated by a shoal (ridge of Ijadrane). Paleogeographic framework of the SW border of the Middle Atlas trough: A synthesis of the geometry of the ""Blocks of Selloum"" and some paleogeographic and structural features of the NW border of the Middle Atlas trough, as they appear in a recent synthesis [Benshili, 1989; Elmi et al., 1989; Benshili et Elmi, 1994; Charriere, 1990; Fedan, 1993; Laadila, 1996; Sabaoui, 1998; El Arabi et al., 1999], is shown in 3 episodes from Toarcian to Aalenian. The southwestern part of the Middle Atlas studied here, does not appear in any case as a coastal area surrounding the Middle Atlas trough, but like a gulf occupied by marine deposits which is isolated from the Middle Atlas trough by the shoal areas called the ""Haut-fond de Boulmane"". In the Middle Atlas trough, the sequences prograde in a NE direction and show blocks tilting generally towards the same direction. On the other hand, in the ""Blocks of Selloum"" the tilting acts toward the SW, against the direction of the global Tethyan polarity.",,

This aquifer is contained within Cenomanian and Turonian limestones and dolomitic limestones. The base of the system corresponds to the lower Cenomanian grey clays, and the top to the Senonian white marls. Hydrodynamic studies of various springs shows that each water source is different from the other, indicating a heterogeneous underground reservoir belonging to a complex karst system. The springs waters show a large chemical variability in space and time. These waters are a mixture of chloride, sulphate, Na and Mg. High Mg contents of some springs result from dissolution of evaporite, confirmed by low Ca/Mg ratios. The total dissolved solids (TDS) in spring water increases from upstream to downstream, probably as a response to residency time, but also due to interaction with Cenomanian evaporites. However, the springs are good for drinking water, as well as for irrigation. The monthly survey of selected springs indicated a large chemical variability but with little or no correlation between discharge and TDS. Stable isotope data (O-18) suggests that the altitiude of the recharge area, for this aquifer system, is similar to 1200 m. The O-18 gradient versus altitude, established on springs whose recharge areas are well known, is similar to0.25parts per thousand versus SMOW/100 m. When compared with the 'Meteoric Water Line' established on worldwide spring water whose recharge areas are well known, the Essaouira Basin shows rain recharge without any significant evaporation.

Epicellular mineralization of Synechococcus cells in the lake is the mechanism by which extensive calcitic bioherms (or microbial reefs) have been formed on the lake's shore and a marl sediment has been built on the lake bottom. Previous studies have shown that calcium carbonate (calcite) formation on the Synechococcus surface is dependent upon an alkaline pH, which is produced in the cellular microenvironment by the cells as their activity increases with seasonal warming of the lake water. At the circumneutral pH of bulk lake water, calcium sulfate (gypsum) is formed. In this study, we show that Synechococcus mediates a similar sulfate-to-carbonate transformation when Sr2+ is the major divalent cation present, forming celestite and strontianite. In experimental systems to which equimolar amounts of Ca2+ and Sr2+, Ca2+ or Sr2+ and Mg2+, or all three ions together were added to artificial lake water, Ca2+ and Sr2+ were incorporated equally into mineral formation to form CaSr(CO3)(2). No Mg2+-containing carbonates were formed when either or both of the other two ions were present. Mineral formation takes place on a hexagonally arranged proteinaceous template (an S-layer) which forms the outermost surface of the Synechococcus cell. Our results provide evidence that the S-layer exhibits selectivity with respect to the ions bound and subsequently incorporated into carbonate minerals and that celestite and strontianite, previously thought to be purely evaporitic minerals, can be biogenically formed.",,

King'}, {'name': 'Ira Holston'}]","ABSTRACT In the inner Coastal Plain of Alabama, chalky marl is a distinctive sedimentary facies which contains more original biogenic calcareous-nannofossil component than the adjacent marls. The chalky marl is one facies in the cyclically arranged genetic packages which comprise the Mooreville and Demopolis Chalks of the lower part of the Upper Cretaceous Selma Group. Analysis of genetic-package stratigraphy shows that the chalky marls were deposited during relative sea-level high-stands. The chalky marls are selectively cemented by calcium carbonate thus making a relatively well indurated, brittle rock. The chalky marls, in three sections over 15 m thick, host most of the systematic joints in the Mooreville and Demopolis. As a result, fracture-density mapping clearly delineates the outcrop belts of the thick, fracture-prone chalky marls. Joint systems in the marls and chalky marls have two main strike trends (N40E to N70E and N30W to N50W) and two secondary strike trends (North to N30E and east-west), which are nearly parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to crystalline bedrock structural trends and fracture zones. Thus, it appears that bedrock structural trends and fracture patterns have propagated through the overlying Mesozoic rocks, dictating the orientation of joints in the chalky marls.",,

The rotations occurred after latest Oligocene times, and probably before the tate Miocene. This overlaps a period of dextrally oblique convergence during the early to middle Miocene along the Internal/ External Zone Boundary and within the External Zone. Rotations in the External 7-one are recorded by palaeomagnetic results from 27 sites in Upper Jurassic (Ammonitico rosso facies) limestones from the Subbetic Zone, and one site of a similar age from the Prebetic. The sites show either two- or three-component behaviour. The low-temperature component is coincident with the present-field direction. The intermediate-temperature component was probably acquired during Miocene folding. The high-temperature component passes fold tests (Miocene age) and a conglomerate test (Eocene-early Oligocene age). Palaeomagnetic declinations from individual tectonic blocks in the Subbetic are consistent, but indicate large differential rotations between blocks. These blocks are underlain by low-angle thrust faults, which probably accommodated much of the rotation. The largest rotations occur on relatively small isolated blocks of Jurassic carbonates in a highly deformed Triassic evaporite sequence. The single site in the Prebetic has not rotated significantly relative to stable Iberia. In Malaguide rocks of the Sierra Espuna, in the adjacent Internal Zone, stable palaeomagnetic components were measured at one site in upper Miocene sedimentary rocks, at three sites in upper Oligocene-lower Miocene red marls, at one site in Oligocene marls. at one site in Jurassic limestones, and at two sites in Permo-Triassic red beds. The palaeomagnetic results suggest that about 60-degrees of clockwise rotation occurred in the latest Oligocene-earliest Miocene, and a further 140-degrees of clockwise rotation subsequently. One site in late Miocene sedimentary rocks yields unrotated declinations which, if not representing an overprinted direction, indicate that the rotation was complete by the end of the Miocene.",,

Northwards, it is confined by Coasta Iaşilor. Eastwards, it is bounded by the Rebricea catchment and westwards by the Şacovăţ catchment. The Stavnic River springs from Grindeiului Hill, downstream of Pădureni village, Iaşi County and it merges the Bârlad River south of Parpaniţa village. It crosses over the territory of Mădârjac, Horleşti, Voineşti, Mogoşeşti, Mironeasa, Şcheia, Ipatele, Grajduri (Iaşi County) and Rebricea, Negreşti, Vultureşti villages (Vaslui County). Field geomorphological observations and mapping were combined with the cartographic materials obtained by using the TNT Mips 6.9 software. The first result of the application of this program was the achievement of the Digital Elevation Model or Land Numerical Model (MNT), obtained by digitizing and vectorization of the topographical maps at the scale 1:5000. Based on this, a series of thematic maps have been released (slope map, shape map, shading map) and they were classified through SML language. The geomorphological map and the maps showing gully and landslides distribution were made by correlation of the field observations, geomorphological mapping and analysis of the orthophotoplans, edition 2009. The intensity of soil erosion on agricultural land map was obtained by digital processing of information from the soil surveys in scale 1: 10.000, carried out by OJSPA Iaşi and Vaslui, being partially adjusted according to our field observations and the orthophotos. Then, the value of the average annual soil losses from the Stavnic catchment was estimated to highlight more precisely the role of soil erosion in the area. This was made by applying the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), model adapted by Moţoc et al. (1975, 1979) to the conditions from our country. The study area is a typical hilly one where Miocene sedimentary layers belonging to the Middle Sarmatian (Bessarabian) and Upper Sarmatian (Chersonian) have outcropped due to erosion. In addition, the recent Quaternary formations are mentioned. The Bessarabian formations are prevailing mainly in brackish facies (clayey-marl with sandy seems) and subsequently in coastal facies (the limey-sandstone cap resistant). The Chersonian clayeysandy layers are discontinuously extended on the higher hilltops, in the form of erosion remnants (Jeanrenaud P., 1961, 1971, 1995). These sedimentary formations show a gentle dipping of 7-8 m/km to SSE, typical for a general monocline structure (homocline). The local climate is temperate-continental with shades of excessiveness due to the high values of the thermic amplitude and the irregular distribution of the rainfalls. Data recorded over the period 1961-2007 provided by the Moldova Regional Meteorological Centre shows the average amount of precipitation is 530.8 mm yr -1 at Vaslui, 577 mm yr -1 at Iaşi and 779.6 mm yr -1 at Bârnova. The average annual temperature varies as follows: 9.6°C at Iaşi, 9.5°C at Vaslui and 8.3°C at Bârnova. The average altitude of the relief is 244 m, noting that the maximum altitude reaches 472 m in Dealul Teiului-Poiana Mănăstirii, on the hilltop between the Stavnic River basin and the Şacovăţ catchment. The lowest altitude of 114 m is found in the Bârladului floodplain. The average slope of the land is 14.4%, but most of the hillslopes (81% of total) exceed 5%, which underlines the high erosion potential. As a consequence of the general monocline structure of the substratum, the Stavnic catchment presents, generally, both a surface asymmetry and an average slope asymmetry, the first one being less pronounced than the second. In the Stavnic river basin can be noticed that most of the land is located on the right side (of 56% of the total area) with the remaining on the left side. This differentiation is due to the second order structural asymmetry associated to the secondary dipping of the geological layers, towards east (Ioniţă I., 1998, 2000). Based on the geological characteristics and the morphometric and morphographical analysis of the local topography three main types of relief are depicted, respectively: structural, sculptural and depositional landforms. The structural relief is represented by the structural – lithological plateaus and by the different types of valleys developed within the monocline structure. The structural – lithological plateaus are situated in the area of the hilltops larger which are developed on the harder rock, such as Repedea oolitic limestones and Şcheia sandstones, Bessarabian in age. These plateaus (platforms) are typical for the Central Moldavian Plateau and they have been devoted by David M. (1920, 1922, 1941) such as Şcheia, Ipatele and Zarea Domniţei-Poiana Mănăstirii plateaus. According to the flow direction in relation to the dipping of the outcropping geological layers, the main valley types developed in a monocline structure are consequent/reconsequent and subsequent valleys. Downstream of Hadâmbu village, in the middle and lower reaches, the Stavnic Valley is a consequent one because of shifting its southward orientation. In the upper catchment, between Hadâmbu and Schitu Stavnic, the Stavnic Valley is diagonally orientated, on NW – SE direction and becomes a subsequent skew valley. Upstream of Schitul Stavnic, the Stavnic Valley is crossed orientated, on west – east direction and now it is typical subsequent. So that, what particularly struck at the Stavnic Valley is the radical change of the direction from west-east in the upper catchment to north-south downstream of Hadâmbu and implicitly results the changing of the valley pattern. This change occurred in the upper Stavnic catchment can be explained by the faster regressive evolution of the stream system from the Voineşti catchment. This development, triggered by the lower base level in the Bahlui catchment, resulted in both the beheading of the former consequent sector in the upper Stavnic catchment and the southward withdraw of the Coasta Iaşilor. A testimony in supporting this hypothesis is the atypical asymmetry of the cross valley of the upper Stavnic, namely that the left valley-side, south looking cuesta back slope, is narrowed and weighing only 29%, while the right valley-side , northern facing cuesta front, is prevailing (71% of the total upper catchment). The tributaries of the Stavnic River are either subsequent, generally the right tributaries (Ciurdea, Stăvnicel, Urşiţa, Brustureţ, Viscăneasca Valley), either reconsequent, usually the left tributaries, and most valleys show asymmetrical crossed profiles (Carului Valley, Găunoasa Creek, Humăria, Căzăneşti and Glodeni Valley). The scarcity of symmetric valleys is explained by Ioniţă I. (1998, 2000) through the narrow area, corresponding to the ""homocline resultant"" of the two systems of dipping: north south of 6 to 7 m/km and west east of 3 m/km. The sculptural relief (fluvio-denudational topography) in general monocline structure is dominant in the local morphology (72% of the total) and it is represented by the hilltops and the diluvial slopes.The hilltops are either elongated or widely extended in the form of plateaus, imposed by more resistant cap rocks, such as Şcheia Hill, Ipatele Hill or Teiului Hill-Poiana Mănăstirii. The hillslopes represent the dominant landform from the study area and they are closely related to the cuesta relief, since most of them are actually cuesta back slope or cuesta front. Northern, north western or western facing slopes are the cuesta fronts, whereas the east, south and south east looking slopes are cuesta back slopes. The diversity of the cuestas from the Moldavian Plateau is explained by Ioniţă I. (1998, 2000) through the evolution of the river system in a ""double system of stratigraphic slopes"". Thus, he distinguishes two types of structural asymmetries, namely: the first-order structural asymmetry, corresponding to the main dip of the geological layers, north south, which includes all the subsequent valleys and the second order structural asymmetry, associated to the secondary dipping, west east, comprising the majority of consequent/reconsequent valleys, which show western cuesta fronts and eastern cuesta back slopes. Based on the geological background, the double morpho-structural asymmetry and the landforms characteristics, two distinct compartments have been separated in the study area. 1) The northern compartment, typically hilly, upstream of the Stavnic Brustureţ and Urşiţa junction (up to Cioca-Boca village) includes upper and middle basin, respectively an area of 14,212 ha. The upper Stavnic Valley and of the tributaries Ciurdea and Stăvnicel are typically subsequent and they highlight the first-order structural asymmetry. In the middle catchment, the Stavnic Valley shifts its orientation from north to south and becomes consequent, emphasizing the second order structural asymmetry. The relief amplitude and the network density are more pronounced, which are in the favor of higher intensity of the land degradation. Thus, the mean value of the relief amplitude is 41 m, and the maximum reaches 163 m. Then, it was found that within 61% of this compartment, the density of relief fragmentation varies between 6-13 km km 2, the prevailing class ranging from 6 to 8 km km 2. 2) The southern compartment covers 7,129 ha and it is oriented from north to south, highlighting the consequent character of the Stavnic valley. However, the left side, initially a western facing cuesta front, was sectioned by diagonal (skew) valleys (Găunoasa, Humăria, Căzăneşti, Glodeni), NE-SW oriented. These valleys have reaches where the first order structural asymmetry alternates with the morphostructural asymmetry of the second order. Also, the size of the initial cuesta back slope of the lower Stavnic was reduced by the insertion and the regressive evolution of the reconsequent Velna valley. The mean value of the relief am",,

In this work, the original results of detailed comparative petrographic and mineralogical studies of the unit and its separate layers are presented. The studied drill cores represent an area about 73 km(2) out of the large Attarat Urn Ghudran (AUG, Attarat) deposit Maastrichtian in age. Oil shale with primary depositional structure and texture dominates. Laterally, layers, beds and interbeds of uniform composition and conditions of accumulation continue over the exploration area. Significant layering-dependent variations of chemical and mineral composition in the vertical succession of the oil shale unit occur. Petrographically, the dominating thick finely laminated uniform siliceous-carbonate mudstone (MS) oil shale intercalates with variable intervals of grain-bearing oil shale, in which interbeds of proper mudstone alternate with laminae, lenses and thin interbeds of wackestone (WS). The dominating biogenic compounds are: N calcite as < 5 m,u micrite forming the groundmass mudstone, and both micrite of the matrix and > 5 m,u to 1 mm grains skeletal particles (shells and their broken fragments) in wackestone, (ii) silica as < 5 m,u particles belonging to the groundmass of mudstone and wackestone matrix, (iii) organic matter (kerogen) in the mud stone and matrix of wackestone, (iv) phosphate skeletal fragments in certain interbeds of wackestone and very.fine apatite in groundmass. The clay minerals are the only possible terrigenous admixture in certain intervals. In accordance with the negative correlation between CaO and SiO2 the layers of the dominant calcite or silica (quartz, tridymite, cristobalite) occur, whereas in MgO-rich barren interlayers dolomite may prevail and in certain P2O5 enriched beds/interbeds apatite or in Al2O3-enriched layers clay minerals occur. In the vertical succession of the oil shale unit, also quantitative proportions of principal mineral and organic (kerogen) components vary a lot. Distinct thin interlayers of carbonates with low organic matter (OM) and silica contents reflect temporary breaks and imminent recoveries of oil shale accumulation. The data serve for a further assessment and commercial development of oil shale deposits.",,

53e9ab37b7602d97034c4271,A New Perspective on Stratigraphy,,[{'name': 'Guy Berthault'}],"Rock strata appear as layers of rocks, one layer upon another, like several carpets spread out on top of each other. If the layers were really built up in this manner, then the top layer would be much younger than the bottom layer. Stratification joints were (typically) attributed to the hardening of the upper layer during a period of time when the supply of sediment was interrupted. The fossils embedded in the rock layers were generally found to be of deep-sea creatures at the bottom, then fish, followed by reptiles. This appeared to confirm the idea that layers represented periods of time, and the progression of fossils reflected the progress of biological evolution. Only the complete absence of any intermediate forms marred this convincing interpretation of the layers of strata, or as it is known, the geological column. If this picture is right, and layers really are laid down one upon another, then how long does it take for each new carpet of sediment to be laid down on the sea floor? Basing his estimates on the principle that present-day very low rates have always been in effect, the lawyer Charles Lyell in 1830 produced a geological time scale of eras, periods and stages representing the passage of hundreds of millions of years. This interpretation displaced the Flood geology of earlier scholars, and paved the way for Darwin's ideas of evolution over vast eons of time. For example, the Kimmeridgian stage, (a black marl found in Kimmeridge on the south coast of England) is said to be part of the Jurassic period (named after the Jura mountains on the Franco-Swiss border) which is claimed to be part of the Mesozoic era (purporting to be in the middle of the evolution of life). Kimmeridge sediments are dated from 151 to 146 million years BP (before the present). Many fossils are found in the range of ""periods"". For instance, the ammonite is found anywhere from the Permian to the Cretaceous. The variations of this shell fish are (generally) found at particular levels as though they succeed each other in time by an evolu- tionary progression. New Evidence Is this evolutionary interpretation of stratigraphy the right one? Of course, nobody was there to record what actually happened on the sea bed. What we can assert is that these sedimentary layers are world-wide and that they were laid down under water. Can we experiment with models to see how rapidly and in what manner the strata are constructed? We will draw evidence from the laboratory flume tanks, from the sea floor core samples, and from observation of the result of a recent local flood. This experimental evidence has become available only within the last few years. It renders obsolete the nineteenth century theoretical model of Lyell, thus collapsing the geological time-scale. Evolution theory is orphaned.",,

Converted waves are those whose mode changes at the interface and can be recorded in a marine environment in the presence of large velocity contrasts. The difference in acoustic velocities at the boundary means that in high contrast media the distinction between compressional and shear velocities across the boundary is small; shear waves are not as refracted as compressional waves and can be recorded as partially converted reflected energy.The eastern Mediterranean contains two major sedimentary basins, the Levantine and Herodotus (see Figure 1). They have shared depositional regimes and therefore contain similar sedimentary sequences. The Levantine Basin sits offshore Cyprus,Israel, Palestine and Lebanon, and was formed by prolonged phased rifting, with subsequent subsidence and loading by deltaic sediments (Gradmann et al., 2005; Gardosh and Druckman, 2006). It forms a northeast-oriented depression about 2 km deep and contains more than 14 km of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sequences that include up to 2 km of Messinian salt (Druckman et al., 1995; Ben-Avraham et al., 2002; Netzeband et al., 2006). The local reservoirs include both Cretaceous and Jurassic sandstones and limestones, with older potential reservoirs in the Triassic sandstones. Shales and marls of Paleogene, Neogene, Cretaceous and Jurassic, along with Messinian salt and Triassic evaporites all form local seals (Roberts and Peace, 2007) in plays of a both stratigraphic and structural nature.The Herodotus Basin is a northeast trending 3 km deep depression, and represents a slab of the Early Mesozoic Neo-TethysOcean (see Figures 1 and 2). The basin is bounded on the north by the Mediterranean Ridge; on the northeast by the west portion of the Cyprus Arc and on the south by the Nile Delta cone. The Eratosthenes Seamount (ESM), a fragment of continental crust (Robertson, 1998), forms the eastern limit of the Herodotus Basin, and additionally delineates the boundary between the cone of the Nile Delta, the Herodotus Basin, and the Levant Basin. The Herodotus Basin itself contains up to 7 km of Mesozoic–Cenozoic sediment (Voogd and Truffert, 1992; Garfunkel, 1998), and is overlain by up to 3 km of Messinian salt (Garfunkel, 1998; Aal et al., 2000; Loncke et al., 2006).",,

It is suggested that by selectively bleaching the organic matter, dinocysts that were incorporated within the intricate fluffy organic debris were released. The fact that many samples contained high abundance of well-preserved thin-walled dinocysts suggests that use of the controlled bleaching did not ""attack"" the dinoflagellate cysts and did not cause a biased assemblage.

We present new stratigraphic and structural data and discuss correlation with regional geological features. The central Irpinia area comprises a widespread Quaternary cover, a few outcrops of Pliocene clastic deposits, and various Tertiary sedimentary successions, consisting of three stratigraphical-structural units. These are the Daunia Unit and two Lagonegro Units-the Frigento Unit (formerly samnitic units Auct. p.p.), composed of the Flysch Rosso Auct. Formation, and the Numidian Flysch, and the Fortore Unit, formed by the Argille Varicolori Auct. Formation and Frigento Formation p.p. The Numidian Flysch, not previously mapped in the area, outcrops along the Vallone dei Bagni talweg and our data allow correct evaluation of its local thickness. The Frigento Formation p.p. is formed by locally siliceous limestones, marls and clays, which sometimes look like the galestri, dated in the literature with very different ages from Lower Cretaceous to Miocene. We postulate an Eocene-Oligocene age for these deposits, and correlate them with the Corleto Perticara Formation. The Daunia Unit, which is formed by the Faeto Flysch, the Toppo Capuana clayey Marls, and Messinian clastic deposits and evaporites, usually crops out along the eastern margin of the southern Apennines, near the front of the chain, as this unit is referred to a foreland domain or to the undeformed sector of the Miocene foredeep. However the Daunia Unit here lies in an axial portion of the belt; its deposits are stratigraphically connected to the Inner Apulian Platform, which forms a buried structural high. Our data confirm the presence of important duplex structures (Apulian thrust system), which tectonically double the flexured Inner Apulian Platform and uplifts it so that it almost outcrops in the central sector of the Irpinia area, where the top of the Apulian carbonate sequences has been recognized at a depth of about 500 m. The very complex geometrical and tectonic relationships among the outcropping units suggest a complex tectonic history of this sector of the Apennines belt. The overthrusting of a nappe, formed by the basinal deposits of the Lagonegro Units, towards the foreland domain, represented by the Daunia Unit, occurred after the Messinian evaporitic events and lasted till the early Pliocene. Later tectonic evolution was characterized by out-of-sequence thrusting, which has involved a deep portion of the belt and caused the doubling of the nappes pile, with the thrusting of the Daunia Unit over the Lagonegro Units.",,

GWA covers approximately 3200 square miles. The field was discovered in 1970 (J Sandstone) and first Niobrara production was established in 1975 from vertical completions. Horizontal Niobrara drilling began in the field in 2009. Wattenberg straddles the Denver Basin synclinal axis and is regarded as a basin-center (continuous) petroleum accumulation. The Niobrara is overpressured and drilling depths are 6500 to 7000 ft. The Wattenberg area is a “hot spot” or positive geothermal anomaly. Geothermal gradients range from 16 – 18F/1000 ft on the edges of the field to about 28 to 29F/1000ft in high gas-oil ratio areas. The Niobrara consists of four limestone (chalk) units and three intervening marl intervals. The lower limestone is named the Fort Hays Member and the overlying units are grouped together as the Smoky Hill Member. The chalk units are referred to in descending order as the A, B, C, and Fort Hays. Erosional unconformities exist at the top and base of the Niobrara (Weimer, 1978). The upper unconformity removes the upper chalk bed in some areas of the Wattenberg Field. The A, B, and C chalks are the current focus of horizontal drilling by operators in the field. Recent completions have also targeted the basal Fort Hays Member and the underlying Codell Sandstone.

The two productive levels were obtained from the middle member of La Amarga Formation, 74 km south of Zapala, Neuquen province. The outcrop is characterized by green and grey pelites and marls, bearing a rich microflora, mainly composed of the freshwater algae Scenedesmus nooilunaris He et al. and Scenedesnius sp. cf. S. dimorphus (Turpin) Kutzing. Tetraedron, Botryococcus and Leioephaeridia are less frequent. The abundance of colonial Chlorococcales at this eastern outcrop marks the environmental difference from the western Cerro China Muerta outcrops, formerly studied, where prasinophycean algae (Leiosphaeridio spp.) dominate the microflora. Thus, in the eastern area the abundant large coenobia (24 to 32 cells) indica te a lacustrine environment with a high nutrient content (eutrophic conditions), while in the western Cerro China Muerta area, the dominance of prasinophycean algae indica te s another time-slice of the lacustrine history. Conifer pollen grains are the most abundant within the terrestrial microflora. Spores of Bryophyta and Pteridophyta are poorly represented.",,
5f0e00329fced0a24ba6a31b,Dinosaurs nesting on tidal flats N,,"[{'name': 'J. J. Moratalla'}, {'name': 'J. L. Sanz'}]","The discovery of a dinosaur clutch in Upper Cretaceous tidal flat deposits in the Tremp Formation in Biscarri, Isona (Lleida, Spain), provides insight into the mode of life of some dinosaurs. The clutch occurs in grey marls that were originally waterlogged, muddy sediments. The seven elongated eggs are parallel to each other and with their long axis almost vertically oriented. A mound-nest is inferred in contrast to hole-nest described so far for similar eggshell types. The permeability of the eggshell (oospecies Megaloolithus siruguei) was highly enhanced by a braided network of multicanaliculate pore canals. The nest style, eggshell porosity and tidal flat environment point to a periaquatic habitat for these dinosaurs. A modern analogue occurs in crocodiles, alligators and some birds living in periaquatic environments, with nesting on plant-mounds above waterlogged soils or even on floating vegetation. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

61c8e4205244ab9dcb5a5161,"Geomorphology and morphometry of segmented kirkuk alluvial fan, northern part of iraq",,[{'name': 'Mawahib F. Abdul Jabbar'}],"The Khas'sa Soo River is one of the main tributaries of the Adhaim River. The Khas'sa Soo River runs in the central part of Iraq, It is a perennial stream, running almost in straight line, especially in its middle and upper parts of its course. The width of the Khas'sa Soo River ranges from 0.1 to 1.1 Km, whereas its length is about 90 Km. It is filled by valley fill sediments, indicating prevailance of very active fluvial climate; during the Pleistocene and the Holocene. The catchment area of the Khas'sa Soo River consists of mainly fine clastics derived from Injana and Mukdadiyah formations and coarse clastics from Bai Hassan Formation. Along its course, the stream crosses many anticlines perpendicularly, some of these crossings have gorge forms with water gaps. A main alluvial fan is developed in the outlet of the Khas'sa Soo River from Kani Dommilan Mountain, which forms part of Kirkuk oil field. The length and width of the fan is 42 Km and 20 Km respectively. The main constituent of the fan is sandy silt, underlain by gravels of different sizes. The shape of the fan has almost disappeared, due to human activities, but it is still clear on the topographic maps of scale 1: 100 000. The morphology of a segmented alluvial fan can be used as an indicator for active tectonics. The fan form may reflect different rates of tectonic processes, such as faulting, uplifting, tilting, and folding along and adjacent to the mountain front. This study of the fans in Khas'sa Soo River found that tilting had produced segmented fan. Alluvial fan on the valley is shifted to the east as illustrated by remnant terraces (two levels for Early and Late Pleistocene age), consequently the location of the fan deposits is moved down-fan. Therefore, fanhead incision has occurred, and younger fan segments are located far away from the mountain front and fan apex, which represents the tectonic activity in the area. In this study, topographic profiles and fan contours are used to identify the position of the fan apex, identify relic mountain fronts, and calculate the tectonic tilt. Modeling of alluvial-fan morphology is used in evaluating the amount of uplift, which the fan apex has experienced. ____________________________________ 1 Assistant, Chief Geologist, Iraq Geological Survey e-mail: mawaheb_geosurv@yahoo.com Geomorphology and Morphometry of Segmented Kirkuk Alluvial Fan, Northern Iraq .

The geomorphic evolution of alluvial fan is controlled by catchment characteristics including drainage, basin area, relief, geology, tectonics and climate. The Landsat TM false color composite imagery is used to distinguish alluvial fans in the southwestern limb of Kirkuk structure, depending on the tone, texture, size, and drainage pattern of the fans. These visual interpretations with drainage pattern created from (DEM) Digital elevation model with resolution of 30 m are matched by GIS software program after applying georeferencing. From the same DEM, the study created topographic contour lines on the alluvial fan for two reasons. The first is to emphasis alluvial fan borders because the created contour lines express iso-transport energy lines. The lines are very uniform forming concentric arcs around the discharge point at the apex of the fan. The materials will tend to be deposited equally about these lines, forming the characteristic cone shape (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2009; in Sissakian, 2011), especially in typical alluvial fan. The second reason is to draw longitudinal profiles of each fan by 3D Analyst in GIS. The studied area is located in the central part of Iraq; it covers an area of about 6537 Km 2 . The Khas'sa Soo River starts from Cham Chamal North Mountain south and southwest of Sulaimaniyah city and passes through Kirkuk city (Fig.1). The Khas'sa Soo joins with Zghaitoon valley, which drains the extreme western basin of the Adhaim River and runs parallel to Himreen Mountain (NW – SE). The studied area is approximately bound by the coordinates (44° 00' 00"" – 44° 30' 00"") E and (35° 00' 00"" – 35° 30' 00"") N. Iraqi Bulletin of Geology and Mining Vol.11, No.2, 2015 p 27  43 70 The aim of this study is to use the morphotectonics of a segmented alluvial fan, formed by the Khas'sa Soo River to deduce the tectonic activity in the studied area. The material used for the present study are: topographic maps at scale of 1: 100 000 and 1: 250 000, geological maps at different scales, Landsat images, Google Earth images , ArcGIS and remote sensing software and techniques. Fig.1: Physiographic Map of Iraq (after Sissakian and Fouad, 2012) and location map of the studied area GEOLOGICAL SETTING  Geomorphology The studied area is generally characterized by flat terrain with small difference in elevations in southwestern part. The high terrain is mainly of structural origin, which is represented by Qara Botak, Jambor, and Kirkuk anticlines. The highest point in the studied area is 500 m a.s.l., located at the northeastern part, whereas the lowest point is 200 m a.s.l., located at the southwestern part of the studied area. The geomorphological map (Fig.2) of the studied area is prepared by Sissakian and Abdul Jabbar (2013); using Landsat image, aerial photographs, geological maps and topographic maps at scales of 1: 1000 000 and 1: 250 000, with field check (Fig.2).

The thickness ranges between (100 – 200) m. ─ Injana Formation (Late Miocene): Consists of alternation of well bedded, reddish brown sandstone, siltstone and claystone. The thickness ranges from (100 – 400) m. ─ Mukdadiyah Formation (Late Miocene – Pliocene): Consists of alternation of bedded, grey sandstone; some of them are pebbly, siltstone and claystone. The thickness ranges from (50 – 1000) m. ─ Bai Hassan Formation (Pliocene – Pleistocene): Consists of alternation of thick conglomerate and reddish brown claystone, with thin grey sandstone. The thickness ranges between (300 – 2500) m. ─ Quaternary Sediments: Different types of Quaternary sediments are developed in the study area; they include Pleistocene and Holocene ages. They are: Terraces (Pleistocene): These are developed along the Khas'sa Soo River, and its main branches. The type and the thickness is the same in the alluvial fans. Polygenetic Sediments (Pleistocene – Holocene): These are developed usually in the trough of some synclines, especially where the Bai Hassan Formation forms the exposed rocks. They consist of pebbles and rock fragments of different sizes and types, usually covered by thin venire of gypcrete. The thickness may attain few tens of meters.

Given their size, managing these systems to perform optimally is a task that should be automated. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a suitable technique for tackling such problems. However, the application of MARL in a distributed system is not trivial. To bridge the gap between these two domains, we introduce the Marlon language. It enables MARL experts to focus on solving machine learning problems, rather than the complexities of distributed computing. We evaluate Marlon by comparing the implementation of a load balancing use case in Marlon with an ad-hoc implementation.

A unique opportunity to study the climate changes where this stage boundary is well constrained by fossils. Indeed, some localities of the Limagne Graben Basin are so rich in mammal remains that they have become a European reference for mammal biostratigraphy. The dominant sedimentary facies of the lacustrine deposits in the northern part of the Limagne Graben Basin are composed of poorly cemented marls and calcarenites containing various plants and animals remains (e.g. algae, fish bones and teeth, gastropods, ostracods, mammals, birds and reptiles remains) associated with stromatolites. Mammal remains, well described in this area from the literature, were used to constrain the chronostratigraphic context of this lacustrine basin, with refinement thanks to new carbon and oxygen isotope measurements, palynological and sedimentological data. In this work, the available information obtained from a classical paleoecological study has been refined by new carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of carbonates and fish teeth retrieved from the washed sediment residues. The results of this study confirm that the Oligocene/Miocene boundary in Europe was a general period of aridity, associated with a cooler climate, which could be the cause of the decline in mammal paleodiversity observed during this period. The gradual evolution from brackish to fresh waters is indicated by the presence of ostracods and gastropods, and the major development of caddisflies. This period is associated to humid climatic conditions while a gradual increase in temperature took place throughout the second part of the Aquitanian. These environmental changes were driven by strong variations of temperatures and a contrasted seasonality.",,

Based on semi-quantitative measurements of test shape parameters from different stratigraphic levels, four categories of test shape were recognized, whereby the flattened lenticular and subglobular tests predominate in the marl and arenaceous marlite while lenticular and inflated lenticular tests show wide distribution. Based on test shape and host lithology, four morphogroups (A-D) are recognized.

At the Bjala 2b site, rhythmic sedimentation under hemipelagic conditions from the Late Cretaceous (30 m below the K-T boundary) to the early Paleogene (70 m above the K-T boundary) resulted in the deposition of 100 m of marly limestone and intercalated marl. In these strata, 200 marly limestone beds correspond to precessional Milankovitch cycles of an average duration of 22.5 k.y. An absolute geological time scale over 4 m.y. is obtained from the number of limestone beds of the measured magnetic polarity zones (chronozones 29R to 27R). The reference age (65.0 Ma) is assumed to correspond to the level with the maximum Ir and Ni-rich spinet content in the K-T profile. The process of geomagnetic polarity reversals is relatively short (5-10 k.y.) compared to the geomagnetic polarity zones between the reversals (0.2-1.2 m.y.).

Magnetostratigraphy confirms that the upper part of the terrace gravel and all of the 4-m-thick loess cover is normally magnetized and therefore less than about 780,000 yr. Artifacts collected from the oldest loess suggest an age of about 400,000 yr for the inception of loess deposition in this area. The soil horizons in loess dominantly have argillic or albic character, with redoximorphic features that include mottles, glossic tongues, and zones of ferromanganese concretions. Soil colors become progressively redder with depth in the loess cover and are most red, a 2.5 YR color hue, in the top of the terrace gravel. The upper horizons in gravel have abundant ghosts of completely weathered marl and sandstone. Rubification and weathering of stones diminishes with depth to fresh, slightly carbonate enriched parent material at 12 m. The heavy mineral composition of the sand fraction suggests minor discontinuities in loess-derived horizons. Abundance of opaque heavy minerals and picotite, which are resistant to weathering, increases from the soil surface to the base of the loess, is highest in the upper part of the terrace gravel, and decreases from there to the C horizon in gravel. Depth functions of major elements to Si in the medium silt fraction (10-30 pm) indicate a downward increase in degree of decalcification and of dissolution of primary minerals. Micromorphology adds detail to the interpretation of these complex soils: yellow complex ferriargillans are present in almost all horizons; they are rare at the top of the sequence in loess and become progressively more abundant with depth, reaching a maximum in the upper 3 m of the gravel and then decreasing with further depth to 12 m. We interpret this peak in abundance of yellow cutans to result from long continued clay illuviation to this depth horn a succession of eluvial zones in the aggrading loessial sequence above. Distinctive red, hematite-rich argillans are abundant only in the upper horizons in the gravel. The red argillans relate to initial development of the soil in gravel, because they are included as pedorelicts in the deepest loess layer, where they are embedded in the yellow argillans. Stratigraphic and pedologic evidence indicates that these soils began forming in terrace gravel for perhaps 300,000 yr during the early middle Pleistocene. From this relict core these soils continued developing, both downward by continuing deep decalcification and argilluviation and upward as a sequence of wet Alfisols developed in a succession of loess layers that began aggrading about 400,000 yr ago. A paleoclimatic record can be perceived weakly in these soils, mainly by thick horizons of Fe-Mn nodules that mark boundaries between episodes of loess deposition that took place during glacial cold phases. Paleofeatures from one unit to another are similar in kind and intensity, indicating a degree of continuity of a basic set of pedogenic processes, principally decalcification, argilluviation, and redoximorphism. These soils can be regarded as Vetusols because a single dominant set of pedogenic features are represented in all parts of these soils and deeper parts of these aggrading super profiles have never been isolated from continuing pedogenic change to the present.

Bednarik'}],"Modern rock art dating began with the analysis of secondary calcite deposits in an Australian cave that are directly and physically related to petroglyphs sandwiched between them. Since then, further work has been conducted, but has resulted in more questions than answers. This paper summarises the research so far conducted on the isotopic geochemistry of such deposits and the implications for the scientific dating of cave petroglyphs. Caution is advocated in the interpretation of these empirical results and a possible strategy of future research is identified. Introduction The cave art of Australia is the world’s second largest concentration of rock art that survived either entirely or principally in limestone caves. Although there are pictograms (pigmented rock art) in several caves on the Nullarbor (Lane and Richards 1966) and in three Tasmanian caves (Loy et al. 1990), the bulk of Australian cave art consists of petroglyphs (rock art produced by a reductive method). They have so far been reported from four geographical regions. These are the limestone areas near Perth, the Nullarbor karst plain, the Mt Gambier karst, and a single instance from near Buchan, eastern Victoria (Figure 1). By far the largest concentration so far found is that near Mt Gambier, extending roughly from Millicent in the far south-east of Australia to Portland in western Victoria. With a few notable exceptions, most of these sites of Australian cave petroglyphs (Bednarik 1990) have only been reported and examined since about 1980. However, the question of their age estimation has been investigated since that same time, and in fact led to the first attempts of direct dating of any rock art in the world. Investigation of the potential of isotopic geochemistry in establishing the antiquity of rock art in limestone caves thus began in 1980. In a determination of the merits of a geomorphological and geochemical examination of the media of cave petroglyphs, ranging from hammered to abraded markings and finger flutings, of dating clues derived from the materials bearing or concealing this art, we need to acquaint ourselves with the nature of speleothems. Equally important are the effects of modification processes on them, and the significance of different states of preservation. These issues are to be considered here. Carbonate speleothems Speleothems (for definition see Moore 1952) result from the responses of particular dissolved rock constituents to atmospheric/hydrospheric conditions in a cave space. They are formations of precipitated compounds such as chlorides (Goede et al. 1992), nitrates, sulphates (James 1991) and, most importantly, carbonates. Calcite, dolomite and aragonite generally form carbonate speleothems. They occur in a number of modes, for example as the familiar stalactitic growths, as dripstone curtains, helictites, straws, cauliflower formations, and as cutaneous flowstone formations of various forms. They can also occur as mondmilch (montmilch, moomilk, Bergmilch, etc.; Bates and Jackson 1987; Fischer 1989). The morphology of this form of carbonate speleothem ranges from a dough-like soft mass, over a metre thick and of very high water content, to a sparse white and powdery growth. Consisting usually of comparatively pure calcite deposited in crystal form, the size of the crystals and their mode of arrangement and spacing may differ substantially (Dreybrodt 1988) in different forms of carbonate speleothems. The crystals may be massive and densely packed (as in stalagmites), or they may be very small and widely spaced, rather like the minute water crystals of snow flakes. These deposits are generally precipitated from calcium bicarbonate solution. The ability of water to hold carbon dioxide in solution is related to factors such as temperature, turbulence and pressure. Pressure changes dramatically when the bicarbonate solution, percolating through gravity, reaches the ceiling of a cavity. While travelling within the rock’s interstitial spaces, the solution is subjected to the quite considerable pressure of the closed system. The cave space, however, experiences atmospheric pressure and Cave Art Research 2001 – Volume 1 2 Figure 1. The distribution of the four known concentrations of cave petroglyphs in Australia. this causes the release of surplus calcite as the solution emerges in the cave. It will be in oxygenous isotopic equilibrium with the water if the rate of loss of carbon dioxide is sufficiently slow to maintain the equilibrium between the bicarbonate ions and the aqueous carbon dioxide. If, however, the rate of loss of carbon dioxide from the solution is so rapid that isotopic equilibrium cannot persist between the bicarbonate ions, the aqueous carbon dioxide and the water, a kinetic isotopic fractionation will occur between them and will be reflected as a simultaneous enrichment of 13 C and 18 O in the calcite precipitated (Mills and Urey 1940; Craig 1953; Franke and Geyh 1970; Goede et al. 1982; Hendy 1971; Milliman 1974: 7-12). Carbonate speleothems are sensitive palaeoclimatic indicators (Hendy and Wilson 1968), and are important to dating attempts where the medium of petroglyphs happens to be a speleothem, or where rock paintings, petroglyphs or mining evidence (cf. Bednarik 1995) in caves have become covered by such deposits. In Europe, the growth rates, duration of growth, and—within limits—the age of stalagmites have long been determined for a large number of samples by establishing the radiocarbon contents of the precipitates. Often growth rates can be checked by a method similar to dendrochronology, because some stalagmites and pearly formations possess minute laminations caused by annual variations in growth, presumably also related to climatic oscillations (Homann 1969; Geyh and Franke 1970). Baker et al. (1993) have shown, using high-precision thermal-ionisation mass-spectrometry 238 U234 U230 Th dating, that the luminescence banding in speleothems is indeed annual (cf. Schwarcz 1980; Gascoyne and Schwarcz 1982). However, the ratio of carbon isotopes in reprecipitated carbonates is rather complex. To render the limestone soluble, an excess of carbon dioxide is necessary, causing less then fifty per cent of the bicarbonate’s carbon to be derived from the carbonate, and thus be practically 14 C free. The method of estimating the proportion of 14 C that should have been precipitated in a stalagmite at the time of its formation was conceived by Franke (1951a, 1951b) only shortly after Libby et al.’s (1949) inauguration of the radiocarbon method. Subsequent research (Franke and Geyh 1970; Franke et al. 1958; Geyh 1969; Hendy 1969) suggests an encouraging reliability for samples from stalagmites; the duration of their growth can be determined with great precision. Absolute ages have been obtained of up to 45 000 years, but they are burdened with a potential error because the initial 14 C concentration is not derived from the atmospheric 14 C/ 12 C ratio alone. A surplus of carbon from the atmosphere is necessary in the reaction. While this surplus may theoretically be up to one hundred per cent (equivalent to an error of about 5000 years!) the carbon content in natural bicarbonate solutions ranges only from seventy to eighty per cent, equivalent to an error of less than 1500 years. Even this can be diminished dramatically if the 14 C/ 12 C ratio in the modern vadose water is determined. Two other methods have been used to estimate the time of deposition of calcite speleothems related directly to rock art (Bednarik 2001). One is uranium-thorium analysis, which is one of a group of radiometric or isotopic methods, uranium-series dating. It is based on the decay series of the uranium isotopes to lead. Uranium238 is by far the most abundant radioactive element in the Earth’s crust, consequently its decay products are widely dispersed in the lithosphere. Precipitated in surface minerals it produces daughter isotopes, and where this process occurs in a closed system, such as in the formation of calcite crystals, it provides a good measure of the length of time since the formation of the mineral. Several specific decay processes have been used for dating, whose relevance and applicability depends upon their effective time range (deter-mined by the half-life of the decaying isotope) and sample availability. In rock art dating we deal usually with Late Pleistocene and Holocene ages, and in this range only 230 Th/ 234 U, 231 Pa/ 235 U, 226 Ra, 231 Pa/ 230 Th and 230 Th/ 232 Th may be relevant. The preferred materials for analysis are carbonates (particularly reprecipitated carbonates, such as travertines, speleothems, corals and marl, but also mollusc shells, bone and teeth) but other materials may be suitable. Only one of these methods has ever been applied to rock art, thorium-uranium dating, as noted below. Finally, a new development in cave art dating is the use of thermoluminescence (TL) analysis to estimate the ages of calcite deposits. Two applications of this experimental method have so far been reported, one in Spain (Arias et al. 2000), the other in Piauí, Brazil. So far the method has not been applied in Australia, but this may only be a question of time. The term TL refers to the release of energy by crystalline solids when heated or exposed to light. Ionising environmental alpha, beta and gamma radiation results in the release of electrons and other charge carriers (‘holes’) in these materials. Electrons become trapped in defects of their crystal lattice, such as impurities or chemical substitutions. These metaCave Art Research 2001 – Volume 1 3 stable charge carriers accumulate over time at a known and largely constant rate determined by the dose of the radiation. They can be ejected from their ‘traps’ by an input of additional energy, causing them to recombine, which releases their excess energy as light, measurable in photons. This energy (TL) is therefore, with some qualifications, a function",,

A magnesium smectite (i.e., Mg-smectite) was the predominant clay mineral at the K/T boundary not only at Stevns Klint and at Nye Kløv; it was also found to be the predominant clay mineral in the K/T boundary at Karlstrup Quarry. In addition, Mg-smectite was found in a smectitic marl 32 meters below the K/T boundary at the Limhamn Quarry (near Malmö, Sweden), and it did not have anomalous concentrations of iridium or other siderophile trace elements. Given its occurrence in a Maastrichtian marl, it is therefore argued that the Mg-smectite is not derived from meteorite impact. The rare earth element (REE) signatures of the Mg-smectites ranged from being comparable to the North American Shale Standard (NASC) to being one-half an order of magnitude depleted relative to NASC. One Mg-smectite collected from layer IIIb, immediately above the “impact/red layer,” was depleted in REE by one order of magnitude relative to NASC, and these levels of REE are comparable to those of smectite and illite/smectite (I/S) formed authigenically in bentonites and K-bentonites, respectively. Thus, the REE data suggest this Mg-smectite in all likelihood was formed authigenically from a glassy precursor. The presence of the low levels of REE of the Mg-smectite in the layer IIIb has no particular significance other than to suggest that this Mg-smectite separate was the least contaminated with illite or apatite having higher REE levels. With better separation, the other Mg-smectites would be expected to have comparably low levels of REE. Given the presence of the Mg-smectite throughout the K/T boundary and in Maastrichtian and Danian marls, the Mg-smectite is thought to be of volcanic origin. However, is not certain whether the Mg-smectite formed from volcanic glass deposited at the K/T boundary or whether it was formed from volcanic glass as young as late Cretaceous.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/8A/74/58/8A7458AAF886E29598CF555006FDE709.pdf

Tut Haklıdır'}, {'name': 'Sabodh K. Garg'}]","Noncondensible gas is a major factor affecting the reservoir pressure in the deep liquid-dominated Kizildere geothermal reservoir which is currently being developed by ZORLU ENDÜSTRİYEL VE ENERJİ TESİSLERİ İNŞ.TİC.A.Ş.(Zorlu Enerji) as the Kizildere II Geothermal Power Project. Under static conditions, the pressure within the production zone ranges from 130 to 230 bar at 1700 to 2500m. Reservoir temperatures range from 219 to 242 o C and under static conditions, the reservoir fluid is entirely in the liquid phase. Based on gas pressures estimated from applying Henry’s law, approximately 60 bar (at 0.024 kg NCG/kg reservoir brine) to 100 bar (at 0.0415 kg NCG/kg reservoir brine) is dissolved noncondensible gas pressure. The noncondensible gas is over 98% carbon dioxide. The reservoir fluids at Kizildere are known to produce calcite scale in the wellbores at the depth of gas breakout. The gas breakout pressures (or bubble point) is the pressure below which the fluid will begin to transform from 100% liquid to two-phase. Gas breakout pressure is the sum of the gas pressure and water pressure at the reservoir temperature. These values can be estimated using Henry’s Law and the steam tables. In the deep reservoir at Kizildere, bubble points are between 80 bar (at 0.024 kg NCG/kg reservoir brine) and 128 bar (at 0.0415 kg NCG/kg reservoir brine). At the flow rates (<250 tph) that the dynamic surveys are run, measured pressure in the well falls below this gas breakout pressure between 900 and 1800 m. Wellbore simulation is used to estimate the depth of gas beakout at higher flow rates. Since the gas breakout occurs at greater depths at higher flow rates, it is important to estimate the depth of gas breakout at multiple mass flow rates to manage the potential effect of scaling in the feed zone as well as the depth of scale inhibitor injection. INTRODUCTION In the 1960s the Turkish government agency: Mineral Research & Exploration General Directorate (MTA) with some support from the United Nations explored the fumarole area east of the village of Kizildere in Western Turkey. Geological, geochemical and geophysical investigations were performed, temperature gradient holes were drilled and in 1968, a 198 o C geothermal reservoir was discovered with the drilling of KD-1. Over the next several years, approximately 20 deep wells were completed to characterize and develop the resource. In 1984, the first geothermal power generation in Turkey began at Kizildere I with an installed capacity of 20 MWe,gross In 2008, Zorlu Energy Group (Zorlu) acquired the Kizildere field. In the fall of 2008, Zorlu began welllfield and power plant modifications and maintenance to restore Kizildere I to capacity and resource investigations and drilling to supply a 60 MW expansion. The data used in this work were developed by Zorlu as part of the testing of wells recently drilled to supply the new plant. The Kizildere Geothermal Reservoir is located at the eastern end of an east-west trending extensional tectonic valley known as the Büyük Menderes Graben (Şimşek, 1985). The Paleozoic Metamorphic rocks that outcrop in the horst regions north and south of the reservoir area are downthrown along a series of semi-parallel east-west trending normal faults within the graben forming the basement rock, which are overlain by Tertiary sediments and alluvium and form the main reservoir rocks. These Paleozoics include marbles, schists, quartzite, calcschists and gneiss. The geothermal reservoir is a fractured reservoir. These semi-parallel east-west trending normal faults parallel to the graben and that cut formations from the Tertiary to the Palaeozoic provide potential conduits for upflowing hot water at Kizildere as well as in other geothermal reservoirs related to grabens in the Aegean Extensional Province (Ciftci and Bozkurt, 2009). This province is characterized by thin crust and high heat flow. The graben-oriented faults appear to be cut by a second set of north-south trending faults in the immediate vicinity of the Kizildere reservoir. Recent seismic activity suggests that the area is tectonically active and is extending in the north-south direction (Simsek, 2003) and therefore the faults have the potential to be open and permeable. Deep production zones at Kizildere are primarily encountered in the brittle limestone, marl, marbles, quartzite and gneiss of the Paleozoic metamorphic rocks, as in other geothermal systems related to Aegean grabens (Tarcan et al., 2000). High clay (or mica) content in layers within the metamorphics provide impermeable caps to the upwelling geothermal fluid in the permeable reservoir zones hosted in more brittle formations. It appears that production zones occur at the intersection of fractures and brittle rocks. There are several geothermal reservoirs located along the Menderes Graben from the western end at Ortaklar to Denizli on the east. Many of these support commercial power generation from a few MW to 47MW at Germencik. Resource temperatures range from 170 o C to the highest resource temperatures of 242 o C encountered at Kizildere. At least several of these reservoirs appear to have significant concentrations of noncondensible gas, predominantly carbon dioxide. This paper addresses the effect of high noncondensible gas on reservoir and wellfield production in the deep Kizildere reservoir. The nature and possible sources of the noncondensible gas were discussed previously (Haizlip et al., 2011). RESERVOIR CONDITIONS The Kizildere geothermal reservoir is a layered reservoir. The uppermost layer is in Tertiary limestone which is somewhat discontinuous. The second or intermediate layer is primarily in fractured marbles in the uppermost section of the Paleozoic. The third or deepest reservoir is in the Paleozoic metamorphics. Between the reservoirs lie impermeable zones which cap each reservoir. With the development of Kizildere II, the intermediate reservoir will continue to provide fluid supply to Kizildere I and deep reservoir will supply Kizildere II. These reservoirs are primarily distinguished by temperature, noncondensible gas concentration and pressure. The temperature patterns within the reservoir are consistent with a strong separation between the reservoirs. Temperature in the intermediate reservoir ranges from 170 to 200 o C. Temperatures in the deep reservoir range from 225 to 242 o C. Within the reservoir zones these temperatures are relatively constant over the vertical section of the reservoir but vary laterally, producing temperature well logs with low temperature gradients within the reservoir zones and high temperature gradients within the cap rocks. While brine chemistry between the reservoirs is almost identical, the average noncondensible gas (NCG) concentration in the deep reservoir (0.03 kg NCG/kg brine) is approximately twice the shallow reservoir (0.015 kg NCG/kg brine). Gas composition is almost the same with 98 to 99% carbon dioxide CO2). One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Kizildere reservoir is the pressure distribution. At the top of the deep reservoir for example reservoir pressures are approximately 130 to 150 bar,g under static conditions. Of this pressure approximately 60100 bars is dissolved gas pressure, depending on both temperature and gas concentration. Shut-in wellhead pressures are typically near 30 bar,g and almost all of the wells flow are artesian. This gas pressure affects the well production as discussed below. DEPTH OF GAS BREAKOUT OR BUBBLE POINT Estimated Gas+Water Pressure and Dynamic Pressure Surveys Gas breakout or two-phase conditions occurs at the depth at which the gas pressure plus water pressure exceeds the total pressure (bubble point depth). Pgas can be estimated using Henry’s Law and the minimum water pressure can be estimated using steam tables as follows: Pgas = Xgas * KH Pliq = Pwater@sat T Ptot = Pgas + Pliq where KH = Henry’s law constant at the reservoir temperature and Xgas is the mole fraction of gas in the reservoir.

Fellino Ridge (Campania Appennines), has led to the recognition of a km-scale overturned anticline characterized by tight geometry and associated with a NW-verging thrust which brought Jurassic over Cretaceous successions. The overturned fold is a N50-70 degrees -trending non-cylindrical structure, whereas the thrust is refolded by a N100-120 degrees -trending open anticline. Such a structure is recognizable also toward the south-east not far from the investigated area (i.e. Nola-Lauro Ridge). The angle between the two fold hinges is 40 degrees -60 degrees , as shown by geological mapping. The geometric reconstruction of the geological structures out-cropping in the study area has been realized by means of two viable cross-sections (called AA9 and BB9 in fig. 6). The construction of the geological sections has been carried out considering the thickness obtained by the stratigraphic analysis of carbonate successions outcropping along the Mt. Fellino Ridge (fig. 2). Further, the stratigraphic analysis of several carbonate successions outcropping both along the Mt. Fellino Ridge and in the wider area of the Avella Mts-Nola-Lauro Ridge allowed five chronostratigraphic units to be characterized, showing different litho-sedimentological features and biostratigraphic content. In particular, the five chronostratigraphic Mesozoic units are, from bottom to top: - Lias: about 700 m of limestones and dolomite containing mainly Palaeodasycladus mediterraneus (Pia), Orbitopsella praecursor (Guembel) and, in the upper part, large spathic shells of bivalves of the Lithiotis facies Auct.; - Dogger: about 400 m of oolitic and pseudo-oolitic limestones and subordinate dolomite, containing mainly Valvulina lugeoni Septfontaine, Mesoendothyra croatica Gusic, the dasycladaceans Selliporella donzellii Sartoni & Crescenti, Pfenderina salernitana Sartoni & Crescenti, Pfenderella arabica Redmond, Satorina apuliensis Fourcade & Chorowics; - Malm: about 400-450 of limestones which consist of calcilutites and rarely of calcarenites, sometimes oolitic, containing Cladocoropsis mirabilis Felix, Kurnubia palastiniensis Henson, Valvulina lugeoni Septfontaine, Parurgonina caelinensis Cuvilier, Foury & Pignatti-Morano, Clypeina jurassica Favre, Salpingoporella annulata Carozzi and Campbelliella striata (Carozzi); - Lower Cretaceous (Neocomian-Albian): about 600 m of whitish limestones (from mudstones to grainstones) containing mainly Praechrysalidina infracretacea Luperto Sinni, Orbitolina (Mesorbitolina) texana (Roemer), Orbitolina (Mesorbitolina) parva Douglas, Cuneolina laurentii Sartoni & Crescenti, Cuneolina scarsellai De Castro, Sabaudia minuta (Hofker), Ovalveolina reicheli De Castro, Paracoskinolina tunesiana Peybernes, Neoiraqia insolita (Decrouez & Moullade), dasycladacean algae among which, in the lower part of the succession, Salpingoporella cemi Radoicic, Salpingoporella annulata Carozzi, Praturlonella danilovae (Radoicic), and in the upper part Salpingoporella dinarica Radoicic and Salpingoporella turgida Radoidid. - Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian-Senonian): about 650 m of limestones (mainly mudstones-wackestones), sometimes loferitic and stromatolitic, with rare intercalations of dolomites in the lower portion, and greenish marls.

Among the macrofossils fragments and shells of Rudists are abundant. The trace of the cross-section AA9 is N120 degrees -trending (i.e. sub-orthogonal to the first phase fold axis), whereas the trace of the cross-section BB9 is N20 degrees (i.e. perpendicular to the second phase fold axis). In the geological section AA9, one can observe the N50-70 degrees -trending overturned fold with a tight geometry (Fleuty, 1964), in the hangingwall of the thrust. Moreover, a splay thrust cuts the Malm deposits, causing the imbrication of two different slices. The tight geometry of the plicative structure could be linked to the evolution of a previous blind-thrust into a breakthrough thrust (Suppe & Medwedeff, 1990). In the geological section BB9 is possible to detect the refolding of the first phase fold by a N100-120 degrees -trending open fold.",,

Caixeta'}, {'name': 'Talles S. Ferreira'}, {'name': 'Délzio L. Machado'}, {'name': 'Janaína L. Teixeira'}, {'name': 'Marco A. T. Romeiro'}]","The progress of petroleum exploration toward ultra-deep waters along the Eastern Brazilian coast resulted in the acquisition of seismic reflection data with records as deep as 30 km (18 sec TWT), making possible drilling of exploration wells in the distal portion of Northeastern Brazilian Rifted Margin (NBRM). The interpretation of this dataset allowed not only the visualization of an Albian marine rift system along the NBRM, but also the identification of the boundary between continental and oceanic crusts, and their internal structures. The rheological behavior of the upper and lower continental crusts controlled the geometry of rifted blocks, showing brittle or ductile deformation patterns, from high angle faulted blocks to rotated ones. Along the NBRM, the Albian rifting shows half-grabens with flip-flop and magmatic features such as sills and dykes sometimes related to a broad SDR’s domain. Aptian salt diapirs are deformed within some distal Albian grabens suggesting that rifting occurred after the deposition of the Aptian salt. The Albian rift system exhibits wide variation of structural style and amount of associated magmatism. In the central portion of the NBRM, the Jacuípe and Sergipe-Alagoas basins are characterized by widespread magmatism represented by large intrusions and magmatic flows (SDRs). Further north, the Pernambuco-Paraíba Basin presents a typical half-graben geometry associated with huge igneous features. The Albian age of the distal rift system was confirmed by pillow basalts (identified by resistivity image logging) interbedded with rift sediments. Moreover, samples of the pillow basalts were dated by 40 Ar/ 39 Ar around 104 Ma, correlated to magmatic bodies that crop out in the onshore Pernambuco-Paraíba Basin, which range from 94-102 Ma ( 40 Ar/ 39 Ar). We speculate that structures may be related to deep-water extrusive and intrusive magmatic features mapped in deep reflection seismic sections. Furthermore, organic-rich marine shales were also drilled in the Albian rift system, attesting the presence of source rocks to Upper Cretaceous oil fields recently discovered in the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin. Therefore, the architecture of the Albian rift system plays an important role in understanding the tectonic evolution of the Northeastern Brazilian Rifted Margin and its associated marine petroleum system. The Northeastern Brazilian Rifted Margin (NBRM): An Odd Puzzle The Northeast Brazilian Rifted Margin (NBRM) comprises the northern portion of the East Brazilian Margin (EBM) where are located the Jequitinhonha-Almada-Camamu (Ferreira et al., 2013), Sergipe-Alagoas and Pernambuco-Paraíba rift basin sets (Figure 1A). The NBRM is limited southwards in the Jequitinhonha Basin by the Cenozoic Abrolhos magmatic complex, and northwards by the Equatorial Brazilian Margin tip the Touros structural high in the Potiguar Basin. Unlike the southern part of the EBM, which is well studied due to the recent presalt petroleum discoveries in the Campos, Santos and Espírito Santo basins, the distal part of NBRM remains poorly known, despite of the recent discovery of a petroleum province related to Upper Cretaceous turbidites in Sergipe-Alagoas Basin. Recent works (Caixeta et al., 2009, 2012; Ferreira et al., 2011; Ferreira and Caixeta, 2012) have argued the NBRM underwent a quite distinct tectonic evolution of the rest of the EBM. New seismic reflection data with records as deep as 30 km (18 sec TWT), associated with geological information from some exploration wells in the distal portion of the NBRM, have brought great advances to understanding the tectonic evolution of the EBM. By means of interpretation of deep seismic sections it was observed that some well-established geological concepts about the breakup process in the EBM are outdated. A good example is to use the deposition of Aptian evaporites as a regional mark for ending of the rifting and the beginning of a widespread thermal stage along the entire EBM. This assumption might be useful for the southern portion of the EBM (basically Campos and Santos basins), but definitely can no longer be applied in the NBRM. Thus, the NBRM presents an odd tectonic story within a long-standing breakup model for the splitting up of the South American and African supercontinents. The Marine Magmatic Albian Rifting: The Missing Piece of the Puzzle The rifting process along the NBRM can be told in a single story (a common genetic tectonic story) composed by several chapters (poly phase rifting) where the characters (the basins) alternated a final chapter that was unknown (the Albian rifting). Now, this final chapter is played due to advancement of the petroleum exploration frontier toward ultra-deep waters. The earliest rifting in the Northeastern Brazilian coast occurred during Neocomian-Barremian times, with the onshore Reconcavo-Tucano-Jatoba rift system as its best example. During the Neo-Aptian, the NBRM began to develop its current framework through the linkage of isolated large grabens or basin depocenters strongly bounded by basement lineaments (e.g. Vaza-Barris). Some wells record more than 1 km of Aptian rift sediments in the Camamu, Almada and PernambucoParaíba basins. From the Mid-Aptian, the rift architecture changed with the formation of conspicuous hinge faults basinward in Camamu, Almada and Pernambuco-Paraíba basins, while other areas such as Sergipe-Alagoas and Jequitinhonha had progressively less fault activity with initiation of thermal subsidence, known as SAG phase that was widespread until the Neo-Aptian when the Gondwana breakup had taken place. During this period the deposition of evaporites occurred which would mark the beginning of the drift phase. Until the last decade, the tectonic story of the EBM could be briefly told this way. However, recently some deepwater wells located in Sergipe-Alagoas and Almada basins revealed an Albian rift system with a stratigraphic section very similar along the NBRM, basically dominated by marine pelites. A representative Albian rift section can be described by shale and marls interbedded with limestones and volcanics in the uppermost section. In contrast to the sandy Aptian rift section, which ends the proximal continental rifting, the distal Albian rift shows fine sediments deposited under the influence of widespread shallow marine environment. Moreover, the Albian rift system displays a wide variability of structural styles and amount of magmatism along the NBRM. In the southern portion of the NBRM, half-graben sets occur with flip-flop geometry, mostly showing synthetic curved normal faults and associated magmatic features (sills and dykes) primarily within the uppermost section. On the other hand, the northern basins (from Jacuípe Basin northwards) are strongly controlled by magmatic flows which form antithetic curved normal faults that sometimes can be simply described as a SDR domain. The growth of the rift section occurs up to the Albian top, whereas the uppermost section of Cenomanian-Turonian age displays a SAG geometry (here named as SAG II) without significant fault control (Figrue 1B).Thus, the Albian rifting took place in the distal margin associated with magmatic rocks dated around 104 Ma ( 40 Ar/ 39 Ar) in the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin as well as is clearly characterized by resistivity image logging displaying pillow basalts with associated meso-scale columnar basalt structures (Figure 2). Furthermore, thin section petrographic analysis confirmed that magmatic rocks were formed by submarine flows interbedded with Albian-Cenomanian clastic rift sediments (Figrue 3). According to our model, the conjugate margin to the southern NBRM is the Gabon Basin which is characterized by a flip-flop basin pattern, marked by the Aptian salt level. The southern NBRM-Gabon Basin clearly presents a distal Albian rift basin toward the mid-ocean ridge. The salt is not common within Albian distal basins which might suggest an elevated area in that period of higher heat flow. The cooling that followed the period of heating formed a distal SAG basin during the Albian-Cenomanian, resulting in a favorable environment for organic matter preservation (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Diachronic Breakup in the NBRM: From the Albian to the Cenomanian The regional integrated interpretation of the NBRM (Ferreira et al., 2011; Ferreira and Caixeta, 2012) has shown that the rifting process goes on beyond the Aptian, and displays a distinct thermal phase over time. The latest rift pulses were strongly controlled by conspicuous basement lineaments (e.g. Vaza Barris, Pernambuco, Itabuna-Itaju do Colônia) which led and compartmentalized the rift propagation until the Gondwana breakup (Figure 6). In contrast to the southern part of the EBM, the thinning crust process in the NBRM was influenced by several distinct Archean-Proterozoic basement terranes such as São Francisco-Congo Craton, Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif, and Araçuaí and Sergipana fold belts. Such basement diversity reflected in different magmatic and structural styles along of the NBRM due to the wide variation of rheological behaviors during thinning and extension of the crust. The NBRM shows large variation of structural styles from short to hyper-extended margins. The central part displays short margins formed basically by necking zones in the Camamu and Jacuípe basins associated with the São Francisco-Congo Craton basement. At the southern tip, a broad margin was developed in Almada and Jequitinhonha basins, under influence of the Araçuaí fold belt. On the other hand, the northern portion presents a hyper-extended margin associated with widespread magmatism in the Sergipe-Alagoas and Pernambuco-Paraíba basins. There is clear northwards increase of the magmatism related to the breakup. All these evidence reinforces the puzzling breakup process for this part of the EBM. Along the whole distal NBRM the Albian magmatic rift system occurs in response to hyper-extension of crust just",,

The distributions of the methylated MTTCs indicate salinity changes of the upper part of a density stratified water column of the basin. These variations are explained by a tectonically or climatically induced change in the supply of water of relative lower salinity to form a layer overlying the deeper water brine. Hence, it is suggested that mesohaline (3.5–15%) conditions in the surface waters were established as a result of periodic incursions of marine water and subsequent evaporation.

A Haplic Luvisol from boulder marl shows distinct differences in its K selectivity both between different particle size fractions and different horizons. This is partly due to the presence of smectites and vermiculites which are differently distributed within the particle size fractions.

 was placed on the Amman-Irbid highway with the aim of establishing a wider data base of case studies and examining all possible

 within other, mostly stronger, formations, in addition to the steep cutting angles and unfavourable dip of strata combined
 with relatively high piezometric surface brought about by poor surface and subsurface drainage.
 
 
 
 The study also showed that sections II and III of Amman-Irbid highway suffer from an alarmingly high level of instability
 in cut slopes with more than 50 % of the entire route length was found to have high level of instability. No remedial measures
 were carried out so far to improve the overall situation of critical slopes. The amount of excavations required to render
 the cut slopes stable by satisfying acceptable standards of safety, was determined to be approximately 2.8 million cubic meters
 with an estimated cost of 10 million JD’s.
 
 
 
 To investigate the influence of various parameters on slope stability, several analyses were performed in addition to back
 analyses to determine shear strength parameters. Data were obtained from previous in vestigations by local and international
 firms, screened and modified where needed, before being used in stability analyses. Considerable difference between back analysis
 and test result values for shear strength parameters were observed in many cases.

Stony soils along slope catenas of conglomerates and shale-sandstones, despite their normally low productivity, may supply appreciable amounts of previously stored water to the stressed plants and to secure a not negligible biomass production even in extremely dry years. Soils formed on marl are free of coarse fragments and despite their considerable depth and high productivity in normal and wet years, they are very susceptible to desertification, being unable to support any vegetation in particularly dry years due to adverse soil physical properties and the absence of gravel and stone mulching.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/DD/8F/90/DD8F90AC4163EFB135820F379F8B46C0.pdf

Raffi'}]","The Late Miocene to Pleistocene evolution of the northwestern Iblean plateau (Sicily) is marked by a complex interplay of subaerial and submarine volcanism, subsidence and uplift, eustatic sea-level changes, and shallow-water carbonate and clay sedimentation. Volcanic activity occurred in distinct phases, differing drastically in volume, chemical composition, eruptive and depositional sites, and eruptive mechanisms. Six of the newly defined formations in the northwestern Iblean plateau are either entirely volcanic or contain significant amounts of volcanics. The eastern part of a shallow marine basin was filled completely by Late Pliocene tholeiitic lava flows (Militello Formation) that had advanced subaerially from the south-southeast. Lava deltas advanced southwestward on top of earlier pillow breccia debris flow deposits intertongued with soft Trubi marls and chalks. True submarine eruptions (Monte Caliella Formation) simultaneously produced densely packed pillow piles up to 250 m thick. Inferred water depths based on volcanologic and paleoecologic criteria of interbedded and overlying calcarenites agree well.Subsequent alkalic, more explosive Pleistocene volcanic eruptions (Poggio Vina Formation) changed from initially submarine to late subaerial indicating growth of edifices above sea level, sea-level rise, or land Subsidence by ca. 50 m. They and the latest Militello volcanics are interlayed with minor shallow-water calcarenites. The Poggio Vina volcanics were submerged during a second sea-level rise amounting to up to 100 m. The sea was generally shallow, i.e., <100m deep, throughout most of the Late Pliocene and early Pleistocene. The Poggio Vina volcanism took place prior to the Emilian transgression. The sea-level rise might represent a continuation of the subsidence trend that caused the Lower Pliocene Trubi marine basin. Subaerial conditions were reached twice in the approximate time interval 1.9-1.6 Ma during phases of voluminous volcanism that outpaced subsidence. Uplift of approximately 600m (Palagonia) to 950m (Monte Lauro) occurred subsequent to emplacement of the Pleistocene alkalic volcanics. Bioclastic carbonates deposited concurrently with uplift drape a major fault scarp east of Palagonia with uplift rates in excess of 0.5 mm/a, provided most uplift occurred during ca. I Ma. Basinning continued beneath the half graben of the present Plan. di Catania where volcanics several hundreds of meters thick - at least some of them alkalic in composition - occur at a depth of approximately 500-1500 m below the present surface. Quaternary uplift of the northwestern Iblean plateau may have been due to a major phase of underplating or rise of partially melted mantle. Composition of the Volcanic rocks, total volume, and mass eruptive rates are well-correlated. The volumetrically very minor highly mafic Messinian nephelinites may have formed in response to Messinian lithosphere unloading following draining of the Mediterranean resulting in very low-degree partial melting. The nephelinitic to basanitic Poggio Inzerillo and Poggio Pizzuto pillow lavas may herald a major mantle decompression event, possibly the rise of a mantle diapir. The remarkably homogeneous bronzite-bearing, relatively SiO2-rich Militello tholeiites, representing a very short-lived but voluminous eruptive phase, resemble E-MORB and reflect a major high-degree partial melting event. The Pleistocene Poggio Vina alkali basalts to nephelinites resemble the late-stage alkalic phase in intraplate magmatic systems. The Iblean cycle of a brief but intense phase of widespread tholeiites followed by alkali basaltic volcanism resembles that of Etna Volcano where widespread basal tholeiites erupted at approximately 0.5 Ma and were followed by (evolved) alkali basaltic lavas. The immediate cause-and-effect relationship between volcanism and tectonism remains speculative.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/89/4C/E8/894CE851678D7FCA759ADFB9F3CE37C8.pdf
5f0e08af9fced0a24b771d36,DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS OF A SPATIAL BOUNDARY Jebel Bishri between the Desert and the Sown in Syria,,[{'name': 'M.  Lönnqvist'}],"The mountain of Jebel Bishri forms a strategically important natural bastion on the Middle Euphrates in Syria. The mountain has been a natural, economical and political border zone for different cultures and empires. The area is environmentally limited with the Syrian desert and the irrigated fields of the river plain. The neighbourhood is the cradle of agriculture: the earliest cultivation at the village of Abu Hureyra on the Euphrates dates to ca. 9000 B.C. Remote sensing methods reveal the character of this natural frontier, which during the past decades has been combating against increasing desertification. Satellite images have been used in mapping and monitoring the area of Jebel Bishri. A 3-D-model of the area has been constructed fusing radar and satellite images. Environment has stimulated different formation processes and spatial patterning of the sites on the mountain compared to those of the riverine zone. The cycle of nomadism and sedentism is reflected on the lifestyle still today. The mountain is exemplified with the flimsy remains of mobile societies detectable only with the satellite images offering high spatial resolution. With the satellite images numerous tells, ruined towns or villages, have been detected in the green river valley that reflects the sedentary way of life and trading activities. Archaeology provides a long-term perspective to subsistence patterns and site development processes that helps to understand and plan enduring development in the area. 1. FOCUSING ON JEBEL BISHRI IN CENTRAL SYRIA More frequently archaeological research designs have a global perspective to cast light on people in their environment. Archaeology can be brought to study human beings in their environmental context through long-term perspectives in order to approach present environmental problems and make forecasts for the aid of enduring development. Jebel Bishri is a mountain covering ca. one million hectares and forming a natural border zone in Central Syria. The highest peak of the table mountain reaches 865 m. The eastern piedmont areas start already from the suburbs of the city of Deir ez-Zor on the Euphrates River. The mountain itself consists of desert-steppe; the Syrian desert opens to the south while the northern and eastern side beneath is covered by flooded and irrigated plains of the Euphrates. The mountain consists of limestone and sand stone, but there also exist basalt outcrops and marl terraces on the edges of the alluvial zone. Tectonic activities are distinctly visible in the basalt outcrops, such as the cape of Halabiya. (Wirth, 1971). The yearly precipitation in the area of Jebel Bishri hardly reaches 150 mm; only once in ten years the amount of rainfall extends to 250 mm. Farming is restricted to irrigated fields in the riverine valley beneath the mountain or in oases and wadis of the desert-steppe. According to the UNESCO global definition, the arid zones receive 80-350 mm rainfall within the range of 50-100 mm interannual fluctations. Grazing but not continuous dry farming can be maintained in this zone. (Beaumont, 1993). The Euphrates flowing beneath Jebel Bishri has been a source of incipient farming and the oldest civilizations in the world. The river has always served not only as a natural border but also as a means for transportation and flow of information. The Finnish archaeological survey and mapping project SYGIS is focusing its explorations on the mountain of Jebel Bishri for archaeological reasons in order to survey and map ancient remains in the area (see Lönnqvist – Törmä, 2003). The area has earlier remained virtually unexplored by archaeological means. With the aid of remote-sensing data we have been able to cover large areas and to choose different types of environments for our field surveys on the ground. Global grids, such as UTM, can be used as spatial units in archaeological research strategies as they offer objective areas to retrieve varied information. But natural formations, like mountain edges or rivers, may also serve as transect lines offering specific archaeological data within different natural boundaries on the ground. The purpose has been to catch information of human occupation and its relationship to the environment. The ancient remains are the target of our study not only for their own sake as material remains marking early human activities in the area, but also in order to understand long-term development through the remains. Environment is a significant context in which changes occur, and the region of Jebel Bishri is a mosaic of different environments. Jebel Bishri is a natural bastion that has been not only an economic but also a socio-political border between nomadic pastoralists and village agriculturalists for millennia. The development and relationship of nomadic and village cultures through time are of special interest. Nowadays the groups identified as nomads consist of Bedouin tribes grazing their flocks on and around the mountain, and peasants are identified as Fellahin engaged in agriculture and village life in the plain",,

Larger foraminifera are the main means for stratigraphic zonation of the Asmari Formation. The distributions of larger benthic foraminifera in two outcrop sections (Khaviz and Bangestan Anticlines) in the central part of the Zagros Fold-and-Thrust Belt (Iran) are used to determine the age of the Asmari Formation in this area. Four assemblage zones are recognized by distribution of larger benthic foraminifera in the study areas. Assemblage zone 1 is Rupelian-Chattian in age and occurs in the lower part of the Asmari Formation. Assemblage zone 2 suggests a Chattian age. Assemblage zone 3 indicates an Aquitanian age and Assemblages zone 4 is restricted to the Burdigalian. Assemblage zones 1 (Rupelian-Chattian) and 2 (Chattian age) were not recognized in the Asmari Formation of the Bangestan Anticline section. The Oligocene shallow carbonate part of the Asmari Formation has been replaced by the basinal marl of the Pabdeh Formation in the Bangestan Anticline.

Vertical motions reflect combinations of subsidence due to regional flexure and uplift on local thrust anticlines which act to modify the volume and shape of accommodation space together with syn-depositional slopes. Plio-Pleistocene successions on Sicily were deposited in thrust-top and foredeep basins, above and ahead of evolving structures of the Maghrebian fold and thrust belt. Collectively the sediments represent a single megasequence defined at its base by a maximum flooding surface of earliest Pliocene age following reconnection with global sea-level at the end of the Messinian. The internal stratigraphy of this megasequence consists of Trubi chalks, blue marls and a coastal calcarenite package with subordinate siliciclastic sand. Plankton biostratigraphy allows these facies to be placed in a chronostratigraphic framework. Regionally the upper assemblage progrades away from the orogenic hinterland, recording a tectonically forced regression in response to regional uplift from late Pliocene times. This uplift may be associated with isostatic unloading in the orogenic hinterland due to tectonic collapse of the more internal thrust sheets. Prior to this, flexure from orogenic loading is inferred to have been sufficient for regional subsidence locally to outstrip uplift associated with the growth of some thrust structures. For shallow-water facies the competition between thrust-related uplift and flexural subsidence can be investigated from the stacking patterns of parasequence sets. For structures developed at greater palaeobathymetries receiving fine-grained pelagic sediment, active tectonics may be recognized from depositional hiatuses.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/69/3C/3A/693C3A8EE64FB37D823E7C149A1B7BAF.pdf

For photoacoustic imaging, tissue-mimicking materials (TMMs) that have tuneable optical and acoustic properties, high stability, and mechanical robustness are highly desired. In this study, gel wax is introduced as a TMM that satisfies these criteria for developing photoacoustic imaging phantoms. The reduced scattering and optical absorption coefficients were independently tuned with the addition of TiO2 and oil-based inks. The frequency-dependent acoustic attenuation obeyed a power law; for native gel wax, it varied from 0.71 dB/cm at 3 MHz to 9.93 dB/cm at 12 MHz. The chosen oil-based inks, which have different optical absorption spectra in the range of 400 to 900 nm, were found to have good photostability under pulsed illumination with photoacoustic excitation light. Optically heterogeneous phantoms that comprised of inclusions with different concentrations of carbon black and coloured inks were fabricated, and multispectral photoacoustic imaging was performed with an optical parametric oscillator and a planar Fabry-Pérot sensor. We conclude that gel wax is well suited as a TMM for multispectral photoacoustic imaging. Published by The Optical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

62299d225aee126c0f20bae5,Podstawowe zmiany facjalne i miąższościowe ordowiku platformowego północno-wschodniej Polski,,[{'name': 'Zdzisław Modliński'}],"PRINCIPAL FACIES AND THICKNESS VARIATIONS IN THE PLATFORM ORDOVICIAN OF NORTH-EASTERN POLAND Summary The discussion of the principal thickness and lithofacies variations of the platform Ordovician has been based on studies of three maps constructed by quantitative method for the Arenigian-Ashgillian depositional cycle. The thickness of this cycle is 25 to about 100 m. Abundant clay and carbonate sediments are accompanied by minor marls, siltstones, bentonites, glauconitites, and conglomerates. The only potential reservoir rocks for bitumens are carbonates. Therefore to establlish the prospects of bitumen occurrence in the Ordovician complex it was desirable to define the total thickness of the Ordovician, the relationship between the carbonates and the remaining sediments (the carbonate coefficient - Fig. 2) and the total thickness of the carbonates (the carbonate isolith map - Fig. 4). A number of thickness distribution zones subparallel to the margin of the Precambrian platform edge have been noted. Assuming that in most cases the subsidence of the platform Ordovician was compensated by deposition, the individual zones would correspond to palaeotectonic uplift and submergence zones (Fig. 1). The only exception is a belt of small thicknesses extending along the Smoldzino IG-l, Kościerzyna IG-l, and Szczawno IG-l boreholes called the edge of the platform. Probably during the Ordovician the area was not elevated and may be regarded as a case of non-compensated subsidence. Towards the axis of this element the thickness decreases and simultaneously the deposits bear evidence of increasingly deeper marine environment. This is confirmed by the increasing share of clay sediments in the sequence (Fig. 3). The comparison of the Ordovician isopachyte map (Fig. 1) with the carbonate coefficient map (Fig. 2) shows that the carbonate share increases on elevations with the exception of the platform edge. Three areas of increased thickness values can be observed on the Ordovician carbonates isolith map: Elbląg (VII), Middle Lithuanian (I), and Brest (II). Despite the small porosity of the carbonates the most prospective area for the bitumen occurrence seems to be a part of the Elbląg depression where the carbonates attain considerable thickness, but only if these sediments prove heavily fissured.

It receives 225 mm of precipitation in the form of snow and rain annually, and thus relies on groundwater for all its needs including domestic, agricultural, industrial, and recreational purposes. Severe droughts, especially in the past two years, have resulted in the decline of the water tables and the death of some of the region's long established water supply systems ""Qanats"". Due to the lack of appreciable vegetation cover in most part of the region and steep slopes, moderate intensity rainfalls can lead to destructive floods as have happened in the past (e.g. August 2000 Flood). The geology of the area comprises limestone, dolomite, marl, gypsiferous marl, and conglomerate in the form of Delichai, Lar, and Cretaceous Limestone Formations. Rock outcrops cover about 30% of the region and the remaining is overlain by thick alluvium and alluvial sediments. Accordingly, two types of aquifers are present;, hard rock as well as porous media. The recharge rate to the carbonate rocks is estimated to be 35-45 % of the precipitation, resulting in an annual water input of 8-10 Mm(3). However, recharge rate through the non-carbonate formations is less than 20% of the precipitation, leading to inappreciable water input. In order to measure the infiltration capacity of the alluviums, 16 double rings infiltration tests were carried out in two separate alluvial plains. The results show an infiltration capacity ranging from 0.7 to 1.2 Cm/hr for Shahrood plain and 1.2 to 7.3 Cm/hr for the flood plains of Tash and Mojen ephemeral creeks. Groundwater samples from 18 different bores were analysed for major ions and field parameters to evaluate the quality of groundwater and potential source/s of contamination. The average electrical conductivity of the samples taken from hard rock aquifer is 550 muS/cm which is considerably lower than alluvial aquifer with an EC of 1165 muS/cm. Majority of the samples show high salinity hazard while all samples are classified as low SAR hazard. On the basis of Piper classification, most samples are positioned just below the ""permanent hardness"" area of the plot (Hounslow, 1995) which reflects the influence of of calcareous and gypsiferous formations. All samples are supersaturated with respect to calcite (SI = 0.22-1.17), albite and anorthite and are undersaturated with respect to other minerals such as gypsum and dolomite. The main chemical reactions controlling the groundwater chemistry include; reverse ion exchange, calcite precipitation, silicate/carbonate weathering, and gypsum dissolution. Due to the great thickness of the unsaturated zone and the fine size of alluvial sediments, the contamination risk to groundwater is low. However, the contaminated irrigation return flow, the wastewater of a local sugar mill, and Shahrood sewerage and wastewater are of the potential contaminants.",,

5f0dde299fced0a24b1e405e,Fold structure and underground drainage pattern in the alpine karst system,,[{'name': 'Hochifen-Gottesacker'}],"This paper summarises seven years of hydrogeological research in the alpine karst system Hochifen-Gottesacker (Germany/Austria). Geologically, the site belongs to the Helvetic nappes and consists of Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. The Schrattenkalk limestone forms a relatively thin karst aquifer above or between thick marl aquicludes, forcing groundwater to flow parallel to the strata. The limestone is intensively cut by faults and fractures favouring karstification. The fault offsets are relatively small, so that their influence on the large-scale groundwater flow paths is limited. The site is thus ideal to study the influence of fold structures on the drainage pattern. Multi-tracer tests with a total of 16 injections demonstrated that troughs of plunging synclines form the main underground flow paths, while crests of anticlines act as local groundwater divides in the higher karst zones where the base of the aquifer is above the level of the surrounding valleys. In an adjacent valley that receives inflow from several synclines, tracer tests confirmed a major underground drainage system running across the folds. An axial culmination in the area is part of the continental water divide Rhine-Danube; an axial depression acts as a zone of confluence. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Dieser Artikel fasst die Ergebnisse von sieben Jahren hydrogeologischer Forschung im alpinen Karstsystem Hochifen-Gottesacker zusammen (Deutschland/Österreich). Das Gebiet gehört zu den Helvetischen Decken und besteht aus Sedimentgesteinen der Kreide. Der Schrattenkalk bildet einen geringmächtigen Karstaquifer oberhalb bzw. zwischen mächtigen Mergelformationen. Der unterirdische Abfluss erfolgt überwiegend schichtparallel. Der Kalkstein ist stark geklüftet und von Störungen durchzogen, was die Verkarstung begünstigt. Der Versatz der Störungen und somit auch ihr Einfluss auf die grossräumigen Fliesswege ist aber recht gering. Das Gebiet ist deshalb ideal, um den Einfluss der Faltenstrukturen auf das Entwässerungsmuster zu studieren. Durch Markierungsversuche mit insgesamt 16 Eingaben konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Troglinien der abtauchenden Synklinalen unterirdische Abflussbahnen bilden, während die Scheitellinien der Antiklinalen als lokale Wasserscheiden wirken, zumindest in den Hochlagen, wo sich die Aquiferbasis oberhalb des Talniveaus befindet (seichter Karst). In einem angrenzenden Tal, das die unterirdischen Zuflüsse aus mehreren Synklinalen sammelt, konnte ein Entwässerungssystem quer zum Faltenbau belegt werden. Eine Achsenkulmination im Gebiet ist Teil der kontinentalen Wasserscheide RheinDonau; eine Achsendepression bildet eine hydrologische Sammelstruktur. troalpine and Helvetic nappes. Their underground drainage pattern is controlled by various climatic, hydrologic and geologic factors, and landscape history. Many karst systems in the South Alpine and Austroalpine zones consist of Triassic carbonate sequences with up to 4 km total thickness. Their drainage pattern is mainly controlled by the hydrologic base-level conditions, the faults and, if present, the dip of the underlying aquiclude, while folds are less important (Zötl 1961, Hötzl 1998). The Dachstein (Bauer 1989), the Tennengebirge (Toussaint 1971, Audra 1994) and the Schneebergalpen (Maurin & Zötl 1959) in Austria are well known examples for this type of deeply karstified plateaux. Most karst areas in the Helvetic zone of the Swiss Alps consist of a sequence of Jurassic and Cretaceous karst aquifers",,

The sediments, which are only slightly tilted, cover the range from smectite to illite, and the most deeply buried ones are unique in that they span the range from diagenesis through low-grade metamorphism (anchizone), with no apparent overprinting due to tectonic deformation. Pelites are absent from the shallow section, but smectite occurs in marls as high-charge, K-dominant and low-charge, K-poor anastomosing arrays of layers. At intermediate depths, authigenic clay is identified largely as Rl I/S, coexisting with packets of R≫3 I/S (nearly pure illite), where illite-like and smectitelike layers can be identified by contrast in TEM images, which is consistent with XRD data. The authigenic clay of the deepest samples consists of illite with no or almost no expandable layers, which occurred as packets with layers largely subparallel to bedding, K-deficient composition in comparison with muscovite, lMd-like SAED patterns, and 100 A mean packet thickness. There is no evidence of deformation stress-induced, non-bedding-parallel clays in the deepest samples. Detrital micas with either a phengiterich or a phengite-poor composition range dominate the phyllosilicate fraction of all the samples. Detrital micas show no changes over the diagenesis/metamorphism range and appear to have behaved as if isolated from authigenic clays. Authigenic clays occur as bedding-subparallel packets that evolved during passive burial metamorphism through dissolution/crystallization of less-evolved clays. Where illite-like and smectite-like layers can be identified, TEM images imply a discontinuous series in which packets of Rl I/S (50% I) transform to packets of nearly-pure illite, that is, an Ostwald-step-rule-like sequence. Such immature illite remains unmodified with further burial, and is apparently the potential predecessor of stress-induced, highly-evolved mica of higher-grade, tectonically-deformed pelites.",,

The understanding of the aquifer’s physical characteristics involves considerable investigation, which directly translates into substantial costs; and even then, the behavior of the aquifer and contaminant transport is not always fully understood. This situation is particularly evident in environmental investigation projects in which the economic resources are very limited such as in Mexico and other Latin American countries. The authors have been dealing with a characterization study of an aquifer (involving chlorinated hydrocarbon contamination) in a fractured rock system for site located in Saltillo, Coahuila, in the northern part of Mexico. The aquifer is imbedded in fractured shales and marls from Cretaceous age that do not outcrop in the surrounding area. The bedrock is covered by an overburden of around 20 feet. A series of ground water monitoring wells screened down to 130 feet have been installed in the subject area. In several of the borings, prior to final well installation, video recordings were made to identify the major fractures affecting groundwater flow as well as the distribution of the contaminant plume. Using a conventional submersible video camera, video recordings of the borings were obtained from the upper surface to the bottom. The camera was mounted on an array of small-diameter PVC pipes to control vertical movement and axial rotation. As the video camera was introduced into the borings, a series of structures including fractures and calcite veins were detected; the depth and the direction of the fractures were recorded. A Brunton compass was used to determine the orientation of the video camera within the boring. The dip of the fractures and veins was determined by measuring the differences in depth from the fractured planes as they appeared in both the upper and lower intersections within the borehole. Finally, the structural data were used in stereographic projections for interpolation of the nature of the forces acting in the fractured bedrock. Two main fracturing systems were identified at the site: a North-South system and another Northeast-Southwest system which appear to greatly influence the movement and distribution of the contaminant plume. Once the fracture characterization phase is complete, a series of aquifer pump and packer tests will be performed to confirm the influence of these structures on the groundwater flow patterns. Although there is still a considerable amount of activities to be performed in the tracing and modeling of the ground water movement and contaminant plume, the video recording for fractures characterization has proven to be a very effective and inexpensive way to determine their direction and dip; this information provided a significant understanding of the aquifer hydraulic characteristics. In conclusion, our experience in using a fixed video camera in open boreholes to determine the fracturing patterns including dip and direction has proven to be an inexpensive yet informative tool in the characterization of a fractured rock system. This system justifies further implementation particularly in environmental projects with limited access to sophisticated geophysical equipment and financial resources.",,

S. dimorphus (Turpin) Kutzing. Tetraedron, Botryococcus and Leiosphaeridia are less frequent. The abundance of colonial Chlorococcales at this eastern outcrop marks the environmental difference from the western Cerro China Muerta outcrops, formerly studied, where prasinophycean algae (Leiosphaeridia spp.) dominate the microflora. Thus, in the eastern area the abundant large coenobia (24 to 32 cells) indicate a lacustrine environment with a high nutrient content (eutrophic conditions), while in the western Cerro China Muerta area, the dominance of prasinophycean algae indicates another time-slice of the lacustrine history. Conifer pollen grains are the most abundant within the terrestrial microflora. Spores of Bryophyta and Pteridophyta are poorly represented.",,

Dichotomoceras is by far the dominant subgenus (63%). The Dichtomoceras population of Hinterstein is characterized by numerous juvenile specimens that could be dwarfs or of progenetic origin. The morphology of these ammonites varies between P. (D.) bifurcatus (Qu.) and P. (D.) crassus Enay. Passendorferia is well represented (4%), but the macoconchs of Dichotomoceras, Perisphinctes s. str. and Ampthillia, do not occur.

The absence of macrofauna other than ammonites, the predominance of perisphinctids and the rarity of oppelids indicate a water depth of at least 80 m.

The first one is a graded conglomerate that contains mostly cobbles of sandstones, gneisses, Stramberk-type limestones, volcanic rocks, pegmatites and ferruginous siltstones. The second one is a pebbly mudstone that contains clasts of sandstones, stone coal, grey mudstones, volcanic rocks, schists, limestones, marls, black mudstones, conglomerates, volcaniclastic rocks and quartz gravels that are floating within a muddy matrix. Genesis of the conglomerate is unclear because it shows features typical of debris flows (poorly sorted, matrix-to clast-supported, large amount of cobble to boulder fraction) as well as high density turbiditic currents (indistinct normal gradation, small amount of cohesive material, crushed clasts that suggest interaction between grains during transportation and at least partly turbulence during flow). The pebbly mudstone represents typical debris flow deposits (large amount of cohesive material, matrix-supported, poorly sorted, lack of grain gradation and traction structures that suggest laminar flow). Limestones occurring in both exotic-bearing sediments show different Upper Jurassic-lowest Cretaceous facies of a carbonate platform, which was involved in the source area of the Skole Basin, along with its basement. They can be interpreted as deposits of: 1) platform-margin reefs and a platform slope: a) partly silicified coral boundstone, b) microbial-coral boundstone, c) silicified sponge-microbial boundstone grading into peloidal-ooidal grainstone with bioclasts, and d) strongly silicified limestone with intraclasts and bioclasts; 2) deeper, platform slope to toe-of-slope area bioclastic wackstone; 3) inner platform, including: a) partly silicified wackstone with peloids, small intraclasts and bioclasts, and b) microbial bindstone. Moreover, some exotic clasts are built of Albian-Cenomanian wackstone with abundant sponge spicules and planktonic foraminifers, which are interpreted as deeper shelf sediments. Taking into account the geometry of thrust sheets from the site of the exotic-bearing sediments to the edge of the Skole Nappe, along the most probable transportation path, including tectonic/erosional reduction and different variants of slope inclination, the distance of the mass flows attained at least 25-97 km from the shelf edge.",,

In newer operating areas, API monogram well cements have never been available, while in others, plants previously producing API well cements are choosing to drop such production. This lack of quality API well cement is forcing operators to consider using Non-API (ASTM) cements in applications beyond their previously recommended limits. While the use of ASTM cements in certain applications such as shallow/cool casings is not new, the migration of use into areas approaching what many consider to be HTHP applications is. Because they are not just ""re-named API well cements"", using ASTM cements in more rigorous applications presents new challenges. These include best slurry density, viscosity/gellation issues, thermal stability, corrosion resistance, and reproducibility of data, to mention a few. Moving beyond historical comfort areas of operators requires a new mind-set be established to successfully apply non-API cements in more challenging environments. Operators and service companies must ask difficult questions such as why use slurry densities in the 1.8 to 1.98 sg, if not required for well control? What strengths are really needed to provide isolation and casing support? Can ASTM cements perform adequately at elevated temperatures? Answering these questions, and changing old paradigms on the way cements are designed is the aim of this paper. The authors provide information on optimum densities for ASTM cements replacing API Class ""H/G"", and ""C"" cements. They also introduce new materials allowing for mixability, performance and safe use of ASTM cements at temperatures &gt;149oC. This information includes thermal-stability, strength development, mechanical properties, and gas control data. Test data will be shown to support conclusions and help change paradigms on designing with ASTM cements for use in more widespread high-temperature applications. Introduction Portland cement, named after the Isle of Portland, has been available since 1824. It is produced by blending the proper proportions of calcareous (sedimentary and metamorphic limestone) and argillaceous (clay, shale's, marls, etc.) minerals. These minerals are then calcined at temperatures between 1400° and 1500°C to form clinker, which is then ground with small amounts of gypsum to control setting and form the finished cement(1, 2, 3). In 1940 the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) established specifications for five types of Portland cement: Type I, II, III, IV and V. Although the American Petroleum Institute (API) first established a committee to study oilwell cements in 1936, it was not until 1952 that the first specification (API std. 10A) and recommended practices (RP 10B) were established(3). Although the API has defined nine classes of cement, only Classes ""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""G"" and ""H"" are most commonly available from producers around the world(_4_). API documents 10A and 10B have gone through numerous changes and modifications over the years, but the basic premise of the originals is still being used today. Quality and consistency of ASTM and API well cements have always been issues. The first modern cement plants used a wet process to manufacture cements. This process suspends the ground raw materials in a slurried form. As a liquid suspension, it is easier to obtain uniform samples for raw material feed verification. This ensures that the proper proportions of raw materials are present prior to going to the kiln. Although knowing that you are starting with the proper proportions does not guarantee quality, it can provide cement that is more predictable. As described by Myers(_5) there can be large variations in ASTM cement's chemical, physical and microscopic properties from plant to plant. The same can be said for API well cements. Most oilwell cement service company's laboratory engineers prefer predictability over quality, if the quality equates to a cement that also exhibits extreme variability over time. Although the wet process could provide good reproducibility, it was inefficient and very costly, due to the energy required to eliminate the water.",,

However, the Eocene chalks of Cyprus have relatively high Mn concentrations of ca. 470 ppm, while those of the Late Maastrichtian-Paleocene also exhibit high Mn contents, between 430 and 1400 ppm.

Facies are arranged mainly in transgressive and deepening-upward sequences and parasequences, but deepening-shallowing-upwards sequences and parasequences also exist. Depositional sequences and parasequences are bounded by subaerial erosive surfaces or ferruginous crusts, and by their correlative conformities. It is evident from the facies alternation that deposition reflects a cyclic process in which is superimposed several orders of cycles of relative sea-level rise and fall. The cycles are preserved as 3rd-order depositional sequences and 4th- and 5th-order discontinuity-bounded parasequences, the latter being the basic blocks of the field record. A cyclostratigraphic model for sedimentation shows that each of the 3rd-order cycles is composed of five 4th-order cycles. A 4th-order cycle is also composed of five 5th-order cycles. This 1:5:5 ratio reflects the maximum number of parasequences observed in the most complete and marine sections. The ratio remains unchanged throughout the basin, except by onlap caused by relative sea-level rises or truncations caused by relative sea-level falls. A detailed correlation of sections separated by more than 200 km shows that thickness differences are caused mainly by parasequence disappearance, not parasequence thinning. Cycles are mainly eustatic in origin, controlled by accommodation space. Increased accommodation generates thick parasequences of wider regional extension; they contain the more marine facies in any section. Only some sequences with a restricted regional distribution are recorded if the accommodation is low. The average duration of 3rd-order cycles was 1.95 Ma (ranging from 1.33 to 2.66 Ma), an average 4th-order cycle was 390 ka (266-533 ka) and a 5th-order cycle was 78 ka (53-106 ka).",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/15/16/09/151609B9D698EAA5C147E620613C20A5.pdf

In the present study we analyse the rapport between the sediments of the Murugain Unity and its contemporaneous, that is, marls of Bilbao and Limestones of Udalaitz, being these the most relevant ones due to the fact that actually they represent a brilliant relief at the continental landscape (eg-the calcareous mountain, biolitite, of Pena Udalaitz), whilst during its formation at the lower Cretaceous they were in fact a carbonated deposit raised on the sea bed of that period (pinnacle reef).

With these aims in mind, we studied the sulphatic Haselgebirge exposed to the east of Golling, particularly the gypsum quarry Moosegg and its surroundings located in the central NCA. There, overlying the Lower Cretaceous Rossfeld Formation, the Haselgebirge Formation forms a tectonic klippe (Grubach klippe) preserved in a synform, which is cut along its northern edge by the ENE-trending high-angle normal Grubach fault juxtaposing Haselgebirge to the Upper Jurassic Oberalm Formation. According to our new data, the Haselgebirge bearing nappe was transported over the Lower Cretaceous Rossfeld Formation, which includes many clasts derived from the Haselgebirge Fm. and its exotic blocks deposited in front of the incoming nappe. The main Haselgebirge body contains foliated, massive and brecciated anhydrite and gypsum. A high variety of sulphatic fabrics is preserved within the Moosegg quarry and dominant gypsum/anhydrite bodies are tectonically mixed with subordinate decimetre-to meter-sized tectonic lenses of dark dolomite, dark-grey, green and red shales, pelagic limestones and marls, and abundant plutonic and volcanic rocks as well as rare metamorphic rocks. At the base of the Haselgebirge Fm., strongly foliated fine-grained anhydrite-carbonate mylonite is preserved together with a WNW-trending stretching lineation together constituting an L-S fabric. This indicates emplacement of the Haselgebirge evaporite melange under ductile conditions of anhydrite and fine-grained calcite. In other places at the base of the Haselgebirge, anhydrite is transformed into foliated gypsum leaving behind a still well preserved L-S fabric. Foliated and stretched gypsum clasts are quite common, and some of these breccia lenses and their clasts have again been foliated and stretched, implying several stages of ductile deformation. Because of peculiar fabrics, we interpret the formation of gypsum and anhydrite breccia as a result of fluid overpressure, possibly in part related to dehydration reactions of gypsum to anhydrite. The structural development of the Grubach klippe and of its underlying units reflects a succession of deformation stages ranging from Early Cretaceous to Pliocene. They monitor the structural history from initial late Early Cretaceous nappe stacking within the NCA through emplacement of the NCA onto footwall units during Eocene collision of the Austroalpine nappe stack with the European foreland, an early hitherto undetected stage of orogenic collapse with NW-SE transtension, as well as various stages of lateral extrusion of central sectors of Eastern Alps. Consequently, local data in a high level of an orogen can be taken to monitor major kinematic stages of an entire orogen.",,

These marine sediments are of Pliocene to Pleistocene age and were originally deposited at a water depth of about 500 m. The homogeneous marls have been deposited under oxic conditions, the laminated marls under oxygen-poor or anoxic conditions. Samples collected from present-day outcrops of the homogeneous and laminated marls were analyzed for major, minor and trace elements.The laminated marls have a lower CaCO3 content, as compared to the homogeneous marls, which is primarily caused by dilution through increased input from land. In the case of one Semaforo and all but one Vrica laminates the CaCO3 contents could have been diminished further by conversion into gypsum, which was formed after oxidation of pyrite.Variations in the organic carbon (C(org)) content of the marls are probably caused by changes in sedimentation rates. The small average C(org) enrichment in the laminates may be attributed to better preservation under euxinic conditions.The high Cl content of some samples is probably caused by evaporation of porewater from the sampled outcrops.The profiles of the Al, Ti, Fe, K, Mg and P contents of the terrigenous components are practically equal throughout the sections. The laminates have systematically lower Na, Zr and Mn contents. The lower Na and Zr contents indicate changes in the sedimentation regime, whereas the lower Mn content can be attributed to reductive dissolution under suboxic to anoxic conditions.In comparison with the homogeneous marls, the laminates are relatively enriched in redox-sensitive and/or chalcophile trace elements in the decreasing order Mo > > Cd almost-equal-to Sb > Se almost-equal-to U > Cu > V > Ni almost-equal-to Cr. Syn-sedimentary or early-diagenetic hydrogenous enrichment from overlying seawater is the only plausible explanation for their enrichment. For most of these trace elements the enrichment is more pronounced when the laminates were deposited during bottom-water anoxia, a condition inferred from the presence of pyrite-derived gypsum. For reasons not understood, two trace elements behave in opposite fashion: laminated marls are depleted in As and Zn relative to the homogeneous marls.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/6A/F7/B0/6AF7B0D336BC430361CB35A1FFD245B4.pdf

Those two diatomitic deposits are interstratified between alluvial sediments and represent permanent shallow lakes developed during two wet periods of time. Barranco de las Lumbres is the oldest of these lake events and is dated by fauna and paleomagnetism as late Miocene (Turolian). The upper beds of the younger lake episode (Rincon de la Losa) is dated by paleomagnetism and mammals at 1.9 Ma. In addition to these marginal diatomitic deposits, other outcrops with diatoms have been identified in more central areas of the Basin in Galera village, the lower part of Barranco del Agua section is composed of gypsum, carbonates and dark-brown clays and marls. Here epiphytic shallow-water diatoms Epithemia adnata, Epithemia turgida and some planktonic littoral forms (Fragilaria sp.) suggest a shallow fresh to oligosaline water environment. Additional diatomaceous deposits were located in a more evaporitic zone of the basin near the town of Castillejar. This outcrop presents species (Navicula digitoradiata and Surirella ovalis), which indicate distinctive more saline waters and environment. The distribution of the diatom flora in the Baza basin is consistent with stratigraphic data, which indicates an increase of evaporitic facies towards the center of the basin and the occurrence of different kinds of waters within the lake system. The isotopic composition (delta S-34, delta O-18) of the gypsum samples of Baza basin (Gibert et al., 2007a) is consistent with a Triassic origin of the sulphate as a result of chemical recycling. These data also suggest that a similar recycling mechanism operated in the saline lake system, where the gypsum sediments from the margins were coevally recycled towards the inner part.",,

In the deeper parts of the basin, box cores typically recovered a flocculent surface layer (""fluff""), laminated coccolith marls of Unit I (25-45 cm thick), and the upper 5-10 cm of finely laminated, dark-colored sapropels of Unit II. Fine-grained, homogeneous mud turbidites are interbedded with Units I and II over much of the basin, but the stratigraphic position of these turbidites differs. from site to site. The deposition of individual turbidites up to 15 cm thick does not appear to have significantly disturbed underlying laminae. Sediment trap deployments in the Black Sea suggest that light and dark laminae couplets represent annual increments of sedimentation (i.e., varves); we have therefore constructed a varve chronology for the sequence in order to correlate and date distinctive sedimentation and paleoenvironmental events. Distinctive groups of laminae in Unit I can be correlated across the entire deeper basin (a distance of more than 1000 km). This implies a remarkable homogeneity in production, accumulation, and preservation of biogenic material over much of the Black Sea during deposition of Unit I. The change from deposition of finely laminated, organic carbon-rich sapropels (Unit II) to laminated, more calcareous, coccolith-rich marls (Unit I) is thought to represent the crossing of a salinity threshold for Emiliania huxleyi. The varve chronology sets this change at about 1.63 ka (1633+/-100 yr B.P.), but the record of magnetic secular variation measured in several cores produces an age estimate of about 2.0 ka for the base of Unit I, or about 1.2 times the varve age. The average of six calibrated accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon ages for the base of Unit I is 2.7 ka, or about 1.7 times the varve age. Following the initial change to coccolith-dominated sedimentation, deposition of sapropel resumed for at least one significant period, 1.56-1.25 ka. Since 1.25 ka, cycles of carbonate deposition with quasi-decadal periodicities have produced characteristic darker and lighter assemblages of laminae. These cycles may have been climatically driven. Geochemical analyses coupled with the varve ages adopted herein indicate that accumulation rates of carbonate are nearly an order of magnitude higher in Unit I (averaging 35-45 g m-2 yr-1) than in sapropelic Unit II, which contains primarily detrital carbonate. The accumulation of lithogenic components in parts of Unit I is only 1.5 times the rate in Unit II. Deepwater organic carbon accumulation rates are somewhat higher in Unit 1 (3.5-4.5 g m-2yr-1) than in the upper part of Unit II. Organic carbon accumulation rates in Unit I are somewhat antithetic to those of carbonate, and on the basis of this and additional constraints placed by pyrolysis and carbon isotopic analyses of organic material, it appears that terrestrial organic matter is an important component (perhaps >25%) of total organic carbon burial in the basin. Unit I in the western part of the Black Sea has a higher terrestrial organic component and higher accumulation rates of terrigenous clastic material than Unit I in the eastern part. This difference between eastern and western Black Sea is to be expected because of the major rivers that empty into the western Black Sea from eastern Europe, Ukraine, and Russia. Shallow slope sites, but still within euxinic bottom waters, have lower organic carbon accumulation rates and lower pyrolysis hydrogen indices than deepwater basinal sites, suggesting selective resuspension and oxidation of organic matter at basin margins and focusing of organic matter deposition toward the basin center. A comparison of the Black Sea data with those from several open-ocean sites with similar water depths showed no significant difference between organic carbon accumulation rates under oxic and anoxic conditions. For a given bulk accumulation rate the organic carbon accumulation rates, normalized to primary productivity, are about the same in both settings.",,

The paleoenvironments involved are outlined as well as the sedimentological significance of the very well developed stromatolites. The stratigraphic position and composition of this sedimentary succession used to be uncertain and the limestone from the Mina Verdun Quarry was alternatively considered part of diverse litostratigraphic units (Mac Millan, 1933; Caorsi and Goni, 1958; Bossi et al., 1965; Midot, 1984; Preciozzi  et al., 1985; Bossi and Navarro, 2000; Sanchez Betucci, 1998; Sanchez Betucci et al., 2001).
From the base to the top (Fig. 2), the sedimentary succession consists of the Mina Verdun Group, Las Palmas Formation and the quartzites of the Verdun Hill (Fig. 3). Mina Verdun Group (Poire et al., 2003b) is conformed by:
Don Mario Formation (Poire et al., 2003b): 40 m thick, base not exposed; massive and laminated, black shales (Fig 4a), which are rich in organic matter (Fig. 5a). XRD analysis shows manly quartz, with scarce calcite, clay (illite, chlorite, and IS and CS interlayer) and feldspars (Fig. 6). Applying the Bhatia and Crook (1986), Taylor and McLennan (1985) and McLennan et al. (1990, 1993) plots (Fig. 7) their geochemistry suggests a high degree of weathering and reworking in the source area compose of a differentiated upper continental crust.
La Toma Formation (Poire et al., 2003b): 15 m thick; fine-grained, dark green marls (Fig. 4b and c), bearing up to 45 % of silica and 35 % of CaCO3. Petrographically they show micritic crystals of calcite and dolomite, quartz and feldspars (Fig. 5b); lamination is interrupted by stilolytes. Clay minerals are composed mainly by illite and scarce chlorite (Fig. 6).
El Calabozo Formation (Poire et al., 2003b): 170 m thick; grey massive, laminated, and stromatolite limestones (Fig. 4d), bearing up to 93 % of CaCO3 with some collapse breccias as resulting of probably karstic phenomena. In thin section they show homogeneous mosaic of micrite and subsparite calcite (Fig. 5 c and  d) with stilolites and corrugated stromatolite lamination. Very abundant calcite with rare quartz, feldspars and illite have been recorded by XRD (Fig. 6). This sedimentary sequence is affected by diagenetic features and a fragile deformation (cleavage foliation, shear zones) which are slightly hiding the stromatolite morphologies (Fig. 8), but the main features of the stromatolites from El Calabozo Formation are still well preserved. Columnar stromatolites assignable to Conophyton fm. are the most abundant group of these organic sedimentary structures. This Conophyton fm. consists of unbranching subcylindrical columnar stromatolites with strikingly conical internal laminae whose apexes define a distinctive axial zone (Figs. 10a, b, c) and their horizontal section display a conspicuously and regularly concentric structure (Figs. 10c, d, f). The internal laminae are commonly continuous from one column to another, in which case vertical sections show upward laminae apexing. Their profile is angulate to geniculate and their plant outline could be round circular to oblong, in which case the axes are strongly orientated. The attitude of the columns is usually straight but sometimes they adopt a recumbent and sinuous posture. The column height is up to 70 cm and the column width is 5 to 20 cm. However, scarce but preserved dendroid branching style stromatolites have been recorded on the field, as well as small, rounded plant outline columnar stromatolites have been observed in cores, which could represent digitate branching stromatolites. Five kilometres to the south, this stromatolitic limestone facies change to deformed laminate limestones (Figs. 4e, f). Furthermore, 40 km to south, the El Calabozo Formation bearing Conophyton stromatolites has been reported by Gaucher  et al. (2004a).
Gibraltar Formation (Poire et al., 2003b): 60 m, top not exposed; black marls and shales (Figs, 10a, b, c), pink limestones and dolomite limestones, and light yellow, green, reddish, black and grey dolomites (Fig. 10d, e). The unconformity between the El Calabozo and Gibraltar formations is very irregular, which is interpreted as a karstic palaeorelief. A 4 m thick diagenetic breccia is often in the base of the unit.
The Mina Verdun Group is overlaid by red polymictic conglomerates and sandstones (Fig. 10f) of Las Palmas Formation (Poire et al., 2003b) and is intruded by a subvolcanic longitudinal (E-W) dike swarm. This shows a K-Ar whole rock datum of 485,2 ± 12,5 Ma considered as a minimum cooling (Gonzalez  et al., 2004). The quarzites from the Verdun Hill are overlying these units by a tectonic contact. They have been assigned to the Cerro Espuelitas Formation by Gaucher (2000), which are Ediacarean in age.
Sedimentological and stratigraphic implications 
The black shales and claystones of the Don Mario Formation are interpreted as fine deposits in a low energy environment with euxinic conditions, which becomes calcareous to form a carbonatic ramp (La Toma Formation). The latter shows and evolution to a carbonatic algae platform very rich in stromatolites. From a sedimentological point of view, the group Conophyton has been assigned as a deep subtidal stromatolite by Poire (1987, 2002) based on Precambrian stromatolite cycles from Villa Monica Formation, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, and Logan et al. (1964) and Donaldson (1976) ideas. In this sense, the low biodiversity, Conophyton abundance and the plant view axes orientation allow to suggest a subtidal marine environment for the El Calabozo Formation, with tidal currents influence (Fig. 11). The strong dolomitization of the Gibraltar Formation and their poor exposure do not allow doing detailed interpretation about paleoenvironments.
The age of the Mina Verdun Group is Precambrian but there are not major precisions about that. Unfortunately, the group Conophyton has a wide range during the Precambrian, from Early Proterozoic to Ediacarean, being impossible to define the age of these limestones. More detailed future studies about microstructure of this Conophyton could be useful to distinguish the taxonomy and to determinate its possible age.
Pre-Ediacarean stromatolites have also been described 30 km to the north by Sprechmann et al. (1994) and Gaucher et al. (1996) in the Villalba Formation of the Basal Group (Gaucher y Sprechmann, 1995), but their morphologies are completely different. They have recorded stratiform, nodular-stratiform (LLH-C, LLHV) and columnar (SH-V) stromatolites associated with stromatolitic breccias, which were interpreted as intertidal to supratidal deposits. It could represent shallower stromatolite assemblages than the stromatolites from the Mina Verdun. Unfortunately, there are no radiometric data to prove this idea.
Very well developed Conophyton ?ressotti and Conophyton fm. have been also recorded in the dolomites of the Villa Monica Formation (Poire, 1993) companied  by Colonella fm., Cryptozoon fm., Gongylina fm., Gymnosolem fm., Inzeria fm., Jacutophyton fm., Jurusonia nisvensis, Katavia fm., Kotuikania fm., Kussiella fm., Minjaria fm., Parmites fm., Parmites Cf. cocrescens and Stratifera fm. (Poire, 1989 y 1993), which radiometric age for diagenesis is 795 My (Cingolani y Bonhomme, 1988). This sequence could be correlated with El Calabozo Formation but it shows a poor biodiversity.
The Mina Verdun Group is considered as a new lithostratigraphic unit in the Uruguayan stratigraphic framework, which is probably located somewhere between the Basal and Arroyo del Soldado groups",,

The rock consists of overconsolidated Cretaceous marls and Tertiary shales, characterized by low to very low hydraulic conductivity. The maximum measured underpressures are between 4.8 and 7.1 MPa below hydrostatic and occur at depths of ∼ 800 m below ground. Results from this investigation show that mechanical unloading is capable of producing the observed underpressures. Unloading can be produced in conjunction with denudation (uniform erosion), differential erosion, and glaciation. The effect of these processes, of relevant material parameters, and of boundary conditions are investigated in two phases. In the first phase, simple one-dimensional and two-dimensional “column” models are used under uniform erosion (denudation) conditions. These investigations show that within the range of the investigated parameters and physical processes, the hydraulic conductivity, the stiffness, and the drainage boundary conditions are more important than erosion rate, horizontal stresses, and nonlinear material behavior. However, although underpressures are produced with parameters and conditions corresponding reasonably well to observations, uniform rates of denudation alone cannot account for the actually encountered magnitude of underpressure. The second phase in which differential erosion and, particularly, the effect of glaciation are considered produces very realistic results. This is established by examining a number of combinations of denudation, differential erosion, and glacial loading and unloading.",,

The carbonate cycle is characterized by a gray to white to beige to white color layering typical of the marls of the Trubi formation. A faintly laminated sapropel is intercalated in the gray-colored bed of the carbonate cycle. CaCO3 Content varies from 40% in the beige to 45-50% in the white layers. Lowest CaCO3 content of 25-30% is found in the gray layer and sapropel. Variations in carbonate and organic matter percentages can best be explained by changes in paleoproductivity rather than by variations in dilution and dissolution. Total productivity was highest during deposition of the gray layer and sapropel, as indicated by high organic carbon and Ba contents and high abundance of Globorotalia puncticulata. Carbonate production reached its highest values, however, during deposition of the white layers, as evidenced by enhanced abundances of planktonic foraminifera and nannofossils. The low carbonate content in the gray layer and sapropel is explained in terms of a collapse in carbonate production caused by extreme changes in the physical and biochemical properties of the water column, which in turn resulted in siliceous plankton and opportunistic forarmnifers such as Globorotalia puncticulata outcompeting most calcareous organisms. The beige layer represents a low-productivity environment similar to the present-day eastern Mediterranean basin. Several mechanisms have previously been proposed to explain variations in productivity in the eastern Mediterranean. Both sapropels and gray layers were deposited at times when perihelion occurred in northern hemisphere summer. We envisage that the increase in seasonal contrast resulting from this orbital configuration enhanced winter mixing and stabilization of the water column during summer, both leading to favorable conditions for intensification of the spring bloom. In addition, a decrease in excess evaporation, as can be deduced from the deltaO-18 record, led to shoaling of the pycnocline and reduced circulation, thus enhancing the availability of nutrients in the photic zone. Finally, enhanced precipitation and associated runoff should have caused an increase in river-borne nutrients.",,

Amiata geothermal region (south-eastern Tuscany): new stratigraphic and tectonic data and insights into their relationships with the Tuscan Nappe,,"[{'email': 'pandeli@geo.unifi.it', 'id': '53f3a663dabfae4b34adbd69', 'name': 'E Pandeli'}, {'id': '53f44292dabfaee0d9ba5990', 'name': 'G Bertini'}, {'name': 'P Castellucci'}, {'id': '560c4bda45cedb339750329e', 'name': 'M Morelli'}, {'name': 'S Monechi'}]","A new geological survey and micropaleontological and petrographical studies were performed on the Ligurids l.s. in the Montalcino-Mt. Amiata area. The relationships between the Ligurids l.s., the Tuscan Nappe and the underlying Triassic-Paleozoic succession of the crystalline basement were also defined in the outcrops and at depth using data from ENEL deep geothermal wells. The results improve the stratigraphic and structural framework of southeastern Tuscany crossed by the southern transect of the CROP-18 profile. In particular, three main units have been distinguished within the Ligurids l.s. (from the geometric bottom to top): (a) the Canetolo Unit (or Sub-Ligurian Unit, ?Paleocene-Eocene), represented by dark grey to green shales with grey calcilutite and calcarenite beds, locally with K-feldspar-free, more or less calcareous sandstone intercalations; (b) the Santa Fiora Unit, consisting of a complex pile of tectonic elements made up of Cretaceous successions and, in particular, a dominant marly-calcareous flysch with local Pietraforte-like intercalations (Santa Fiora Formation) and of the siliciclastic turbiditic Pietraforte Fm. with its basal shaly-silty lithofacies (Manganesiferous Varicoloured Shales Fm.); (c) Ophiolitiferous Unit, mostly represented by often chaotic shales with siliceous limestone intercalations and quartz-arenites of Lower Cretaceous age (Palombini Shales Fm), which locally include ophiolitic olistoliths (mostly serpentinites locally associated with ophicalcites and ophiolitic breccias), Lower Cretaceous Murlo-like marls and Albian-Turonian olivine-basalt dykes, sills and pillow-lavas. The tectonic setting of the Ligurian, Sub-Ligurian and Tuscan units in the Mt. Amiata area is similar to that in southern Tuscany. In particular, the performed studies indicate a complex tectonic evolution which mostly occurred in the Lower Miocene to Pliocene time interval and including the following events: (1) syn-collisional and <<serrage>> folds and stacking of the units (Early Miocene-Middle Miocene); (2) tectonic lamination of the Tuscan Nappe (the so-called <<Reduced Tuscan Sequence>>) and of the overlying Ligurian l.s. stack in the Serravallian-Lower Tortonian; (3) development of the intramontane continental to marine basins (Upper Miocene-Pliocene) and of high-angle faulting. A tectonic doubling of the Tuscan Nappe (recently defined also in other parts of the Mt. Amiata region and, further to the west, in the Larderello-Travale geothermal field: see text) is suggested for the Tuscan inlier of Poggio Zoccolino, where an upper tectonic element of Triassic carbonates and evaporites overlies the Upper Triassic to Tertiary Tuscan succession. At least some of these doublings (e.g. the Poggio Zoccolino doubling), generally related to the main Late Oligocene-Early Miocene shortening, could have taken place during the Burdigalian-Lower Tortonian time interval during which the regional Tuscan Nappe Front (Mt. Orsaro-Lima Valley-Mts. Chianti-Mt. Cetona structural alignment) was originated and syn-tectonic extension took place in front of the main crustal thrusts (onset of the <<Reduced Tuscan Sequence>>). This event also produced doublings in the underlying crystalline Triassic-Paleozoic successions which probably belong to the Umbrian Domain. Since ?Upper Miocene-Pliocene times, this complex tectonic pile was dismembered by high-angle normal fault systems (which mainly strike NW-SE, NE-SW and N-S) and produced the growth of the Siena-Radicofani and the Baccinello morphological-structural depressions and of the Montalcino-Mt. Aiata-Mt. Razzano ridge. The uplift of the Montalcino-Mt. Amiata area continued in more recent times (e.g. the outcrops of Lower Pliocene sediments at about 500 m between Montalcino and Castelnuovo dell'Abate, and at about 1000 m in the M. Labbro area) and is probably connected to the magmatic processes of the Quaternary Mt. Amiata volcano.",,

Vujovich', 'org': 'University of Buenos Aires', 'orgs': ['University of Buenos Aires', 'National Scientific and Technical Research Council']}]","The studies based on systematic isotope variations in carbonate rocks are valuable tools to understand the evolution of marine sedimentary basins, especially those developed during a key Earth history time such as the Neoproterozoic-Lower Paleozoic, interval from which fossil register is incomplete. The isotopic data allow to gather important information about sedimentation- diagenetic ages, metamorphic events, tecto-sedimentary paleoenvironments evolution, sedimentary provenance and source areas. In particular, determining the Sr and C isotopic rate in non-fossiliferous carbonates is very important because it provides the precipitation age indirectly and can be applied for stratigraphic correlation in local and regional scale as well. On the other hand, the Sm-Nd isotope ratios on sedimentary rocks are useful because they allow learning about the basement type rocks of the basin and the possible source regions.
The present contribution reports stable isotope studies (C and O), natural 87Sr/86Sr, 206Pb/207Pb and Sm- Nd ratios obtained on carbonate rocks outcropping in the Precordillera-Cuyania terrane (Astini et al., 1995; Ramos et al., 1998) from western Argentina. The main object of this work is to increase the isotopic database about low metamorphic carbonates that crop out in the Western Sierras Pampeanas, assigned by several authors as Neoproterozoic- Lower Paleozoic units, and furthermore, we compare the obtained results with well known fossiliferous Cambrian limestones from the Eastern Precordillera.
The analysed rocks are non-fossiliferous metalimestones, marbles, and meta-marls of the Caucete Group (Sierra de Pie de Palo); carbonates with low metamorphism outcrop in Cerro Salinas and Sierra de la Huerta (Pan de Azucar and Loma de las Chacras). For comparison, Cambrian fossiliferous limestones (no metamorphic) were studied from La Laja Formation (Sierra Chica de Zonda, Precordillera of San Juan).
Sr isotopic data from Caliza Angacos (Sierra de Pie de Palo) are in agreement with the published secular variation curve for the Lower Cambrian and partially Middle Cambrian. The d13C values for the same unit are spread in the C secular variation curve in coincidence with the 87Sr/86Sr ratios (Fig. 10). 13C/12C and 87Sr/86Sr ratios obtained from samples from Juan Pobre Member of La Laja Formation are positioned on the Middle Cambrian interval in agreement with their fossiliferous content (Fig. 10). The Cerro Salinas carbonates show higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios in comparison with the Caliza Angacos (Sierra de Pie de Palo) and in concordance with the Late Middle Cambrian to Upper Cambrian isotopic curve (Fig. 10). The increasing Sr isotope ratios are positioned on the youngest sector of the Upper Cambrian on the secular variation curve for sea-water. This event is in concordant with the isotopic global positive excursion (Montanez et al., 2000). The  207Pb/206Pb isochrone, obtained for the limestones of Cerro Salinas, suggests an age on the boundary of Neoproterozoic and Cambrian time. The presence of stromatolites and the isotopic Sr composition on the Cerro Salinas carbonate unit could be correlated with the La Flecha Formation (Upper Cambrian of Precordillera).
Nd model ages (TDM) measured for the siliciclastic levels intercalated in the Soldano Member (La Laja Formation) are coincident with the Caliza Angacos (Pie de Palo). This suggests that the provenance area for this formation and the fossiliferous Lower Cambrian units from Eastern Precordillera are similar. In the frequency diagram (Fig. 9) the source rocks from these sediments present two well differentiated populations for the Nd model ages: Paleoproterozoic (1.7 Ga) and Mesoproterozoic (1.5 Ga).
Isotopic evidences allow us to interpret that the marine carbonates analyzed in this work could be part of the common carbonate platform during Cambrian times, registering deeper water sedimentary conditions and increasing metamorphism towards the East.",,

Čemerno and the Neretva River basin. In essence, the water originating from precipitation flows through the karstic polje, via a system of karst plains (Gatačko Polje, Lukavsko Polje, Dabarsko Polje and Fatničko Polje), to the Bregava karstic springs and the channel of the Bregava River. The paper presents an assessment of the quantity impact of precipitation and water levels in the karstic poljes on the Bregava River flow regime in Herzegovina. 2 ; this area can tentatively be divided into a direct catchment area (a portion of the Hrgut Range and the karst formation of Mt. Sitnica between Dabarsko Polje and the regional Dinaric fault running from Ljubomirsko Polje to Stolac) and an indirect catchment area which is comprised of a system of karstic poljes and plains. The catchment area of Dabarsko Polje constitutes a significant portion of the Bregava River basin. It includes the sub- catchments of Trusinsko Polje and Lukavačko Polje, while the water discharged via the Bregava springs drains a portion of Fatničko Polje which holds a bifurcation zone. There are several interlinked and interdependent aquifers in East Herzegovina. The conditions prevailing in the Dinaric holokarst are not conducive to reliable determination of the horizontal and vertical extent of karstic aquifers, particularly during periods of full saturation of the zones of dynamic reserves. The considered area is characterized by surface and subsurface forms typical of karst: karstic poljes, sinkholes, swallow holes, caves and hanging valleys. These forms make up the terrain topography which descends from the northeast to the southwest, that is, in the direction from Gatačko Polje (940 m above sea level) and Cerničko Polje (850 m a.s.l.), via Lukavačko Polje (850 m a.s.l.), to Dabarsko Polje (560- 470 m a.s.l.) and Fatničko Polje (500-460 m a.s.l.). Cretaceous sediments played the most significant role in the formation of the terrain's geology, particularly Upper Cretaceous (K2) sediments; Lower Cretaceous sediments are for the most part subordinated. The influence of the Eocene flysch, which is found in Dabarsko Polje, Fatničko Polje and Lukavačko Polje, is important from the hydrogeologic perspective; it is comprised of conglomerates, limestone breccias, sandstones, marls and marly limestones, and plays the role of a hydrogeologic barrier. Previously conducted tracer tests have in part revealed the links between the water which sinks through the numerous swallow holes along the outer edges of the karstic poljes and the Bregava springs. The paper presents an assessment of the correlation links between rainfall and the water which floods the karstic poljes on the discharges of the Bregava, the important role of the flysch in the creation of retention ponds in the karstic poljes and the time lag between precipitation and its impact on the discharges of the Bregava as a function of the geologic base which receives the precipitation.",,

Detailed measurements were taken on more than 130 localities in the Ždánice unit north of the Dyje river, where numerous occasional exposures, such as railway and road cuts and pipe- line trenches, were accessible for investigation during the two last decades. The presented results are based mainly on evalu- ation of the fold axes orientation; although, additional measure- ments of dip directions of axial planes, as well as observations of fold geometry, intensity of folding and other structural fea- tures were used occasionally. The Ždánice unit, together with the outermost Pouzdřany unit, represent an accretionary wedge which formed in front of the Magura Group of nappes. During various stages of the Neoal- pine orogeny, these units were largely thrust over the Lower Miocene sedimentary fill of the Neogene foredeep. The đdánice unit consists of strata, ranging from Late Cretaceous to Early Miocene. The intensity of deformation of these strata varies greatly, depending on number of factors, such as the rheologi- cal properties of rocks or repeated refolding of previously fold- ed strata. The oldest strata, represented by Němčice and Menilite for- mations (Late Cretaceous - lowermost Early Oligocene), are in- tensely folded with ß-axis of folds oriented in both N-S and NE- SW directions. The overlying younger strata, including the Ždánice-Hustopeče Formation (Egerian) and the superimposed Lower Miocene Šakvice Marls, Pavlovice and Laa Formations of Early Miocene, are less intensely folded. The ß-axes of folds are predominantly oriented in the NE-SW direction. The differ- ences in orientation of fold axes between the older and younger strata of the Ždánice unit indicate an existence of at least two movements of the Neoalpine tectonism. The older one took place before the deposition of the Ždánice-Hustopeče Formation of Egerian age and may correspond to the Helvetian orogenic move- ments. The younger event occurred on the Early/Middle Mi- ocene boundary and affected the Ždánice-Hustopeče Formation and the deposits of the Early Miocene. It could be attributed to the Styrian orogenic movements. These conclusions are com- patible with results of structural analysis conducted in the Car- pathian Flysch Belt by Fodor (1991), Fodor et al. (1995), and Nemčok et al. (1998). They are also in agreement with the results of magnetic anisotropy measurements by Hrouda and Stráník (1985) and their recent unpublished results. All these investigations strongly support the view that the Styrian oro- genic phase in Oligocene played an important role in deforma- tion of the Carpathian Flysch Belt (Stráník 1981). On the other hand, the Styrian deformations could not be differentiated from those caused by the Savian orogenic movements, which occurred at the Paleogene/Neogene boundary. That indicates that the stress field did not change during Late Oligocene and Early Miocene times (Fodor 1991).",,

A new specimen of the turtle [Neusticemys neuquina (Fernandez & De La Fuente,, 1988)] and a pliosaurid, are described. The Vaca Muerta organic-rich shales and marls represent the basinal sedimentary record of the Tithonian transgression in the Neuquén Basin. They are associated with nodular limestones rhythmically spaced, isolated coquinas and three sandstone facies. Cycles of two orders are defined through shale/marly-shale alternations. The marine reptiles “assemblage” is composed of pelagic forms. The high content of organic matter, the phosphate concentrations, the absence of benthic organisms and the lack of bioturbation suggest anoxic conditions of the sea floor. This euxinic environment was favored by the organic matter productivity and preservation. Productivity is related to upwelling from an oceanic oxygen-minimum zone. Preservation was conditioned by stagnation, controlled by the development of a thermo-pycnocline and very low sedimentation rates. A period of highstand, dry climatic conditions and low surrounding relief may have been favorable for the proposed model. Tithonian ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs and crocodiles of the Neuquén Basin share several genera with those of the Middle and Late Jurassic European Tethys. The turtles instead, are undoubtedly endemic of western South America.",,

Cuba is an excellent spot to study these sediments and events, as in the territory of the island, there are abundant deposits of the Latest Cretaceous and Paleocene. Especially some of these rocks have been discussed recently as probably associated with the impact and related events (Pszczolkowski, 1986; Iturralde-Vinent, 1992). A joint Cuban-Japanese international project started in 1997, with the aim of identifying the KTB rocks, improve its dating, characterize its composition and origin, and model the sediment-producer events. Some of the initial results of this project have been published in part (Tada et al., 1998; Matsui et al., Kiyokawa et al., 1998), but many new data are still under elaboration. In this paper we would like to present some of the preliminary results, as an update report, until the analysis of the large number of samples collected and extensive field observations is completed. Suspected KTB sediments have been located in different geological context of Cuba, as in the Guaniguanico terrain detached from the Yucatan borderland (Cacarajícara Formation and Moncada calcarenite), in the southern paleomargin of the Bahamas platform (Lutgarda and Amaro Formations), and above the extinct Cretaceous volcanic arc (Peñalver and Mícara Formations) (Pszczolkowski, 1986; Iturralde-Vinent, 1976-77, 1992). Some other units, still under study, may encompass KTB deposits, in sections above the Cretaceous arc, as the Isabel, Cantabria, Palmarito, Coco, Fomento, Vaquería and Santa Clara Formations (Kantchev ed., 1978). The suspected KTB rocks in the Guaniguanico terrain are characterized as carbonate- clastic units, containing several indicators of it relationship with the impact. The Moncada calcarenite is about 2 m thick, containing the KTB paleontologic cocktail, lamellar quartz, spherules, and a thin black shale on top (work on process). On the other hand, the Cacarajícara Formation is up to 400 meters thick single graded megaturbidite, which contain a lithologic cocktail of Late Jurassic through Maastrichtian clastic components, as well as spherules(?) and lamellar quartz. These rocks may have been deposited by a combination of slumping and suspended sediment deposition, triggered by the seismic shock and tsunami waves induced by the Chixulub impactor. The KTB sections of the Amaro and Lutgarda Formations in the southern margin of Bahamas have not been yet examined by the project. According to Kantchev (1978), Pszczolkowski (1986), Iturralde-Vinent et al. (1981), and Iturralde-Vinent (1992); the Amaro Formation is also a megaturbidite, few tens of meters thick, with minimum of two grain-size gradational units, and containing spherules and the lithological cocktail of Jurassic and Cretaceous clastic elements. The Lutgarda Formation consists of marls and marly limestones with abundant allochthonous debris at the base of the section. The age of both formations have been usually identified as Maastrichtian, but this dating need to be revisited. Pszczolkowski",,

Vujovich', 'org': 'University of Buenos Aires', 'orgs': ['University of Buenos Aires', 'National Scientific and Technical Research Council']}]","The studies based on systematic isotope variations in carbonate rocks are valuable tools to understand the evolution of marine sedimentary basins, especially those developed during a key Earth history time such as the Neoproterozoic-Lower Paleozoic, interval from which fossil register is incomplete. The isotopic data allow to gather important information about sedimentation- diagenetic ages, metamorphic events, tecto-sedimentary paleoenvironments evolution, sedimentary provenance and source areas. In particular, determining the Sr and C isotopic rate in non-fossiliferous carbonates is very important because it provides the precipitation age indirectly and can be applied for stratigraphic correlation in local and regional scale as well. On the other hand, the Sm-Nd isotope ratios on sedimentary rocks are useful because they allow learning about the basement type rocks of the basin and the possible source regions.
The present contribution reports stable isotope studies (C and O), natural 87Sr/86Sr, 206Pb/207Pb and Sm- Nd ratios obtained on carbonate rocks outcropping in the Precordillera-Cuyania terrane (Astini et al., 1995; Ramos et al., 1998) from western Argentina. The main object of this work is to increase the isotopic database about low metamorphic carbonates that crop out in the Western Sierras Pampeanas, assigned by several authors as Neoproterozoic- Lower Paleozoic units, and furthermore, we compare the obtained results with well known fossiliferous Cambrian limestones from the Eastern Precordillera.
The analysed rocks are non-fossiliferous metalimestones, marbles, and meta-marls of the Caucete Group (Sierra de Pie de Palo); carbonates with low metamorphism outcrop in Cerro Salinas and Sierra de la Huerta (Pan de Azucar and Loma de las Chacras). For comparison, Cambrian fossiliferous limestones (no metamorphic) were studied from La Laja Formation (Sierra Chica de Zonda, Precordillera of San Juan).
Sr isotopic data from Caliza Angacos (Sierra de Pie de Palo) are in agreement with the published secular variation curve for the Lower Cambrian and partially Middle Cambrian. The d13C values for the same unit are spread in the C secular variation curve in coincidence with the 87Sr/86Sr ratios (Fig. 10). 13C/12C and 87Sr/86Sr ratios obtained from samples from Juan Pobre Member of La Laja Formation are positioned on the Middle Cambrian interval in agreement with their fossiliferous content (Fig. 10). The Cerro Salinas carbonates show higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios in comparison with the Caliza Angacos (Sierra de Pie de Palo) and in concordance with the Late Middle Cambrian to Upper Cambrian isotopic curve (Fig. 10). The increasing Sr isotope ratios are positioned on the youngest sector of the Upper Cambrian on the secular variation curve for sea-water. This event is in concordant with the isotopic global positive excursion (Montanez et al., 2000). The  207Pb/206Pb isochrone, obtained for the limestones of Cerro Salinas, suggests an age on the boundary of Neoproterozoic and Cambrian time. The presence of stromatolites and the isotopic Sr composition on the Cerro Salinas carbonate unit could be correlated with the La Flecha Formation (Upper Cambrian of Precordillera).
Nd model ages (TDM) measured for the siliciclastic levels intercalated in the Soldano Member (La Laja Formation) are coincident with the Caliza Angacos (Pie de Palo). This suggests that the provenance area for this formation and the fossiliferous Lower Cambrian units from Eastern Precordillera are similar. In the frequency diagram (Fig. 9) the source rocks from these sediments present two well differentiated populations for the Nd model ages: Paleoproterozoic (1.7 Ga) and Mesoproterozoic (1.5 Ga).
Isotopic evidences allow us to interpret that the marine carbonates analyzed in this work could be part of the common carbonate platform during Cambrian times, registering deeper water sedimentary conditions and increasing metamorphism towards the East.",,

This syncline with a Senonian axial zone is bordered by two diapiric structures of Triassic deposits: the Tidzi Diapir that outcrops in the east and south, and the hidden Essaouira diapir in the west, which was found by geophysics. This syncline contains two main superimposed aquifers. (i) The Plio-Quaternary aquifer consists of sands, sandstone and conglomerates and provides the main part of the water supply. This free-water table flows out towards the northwest and its surface is affected by significant piezometric variations. (ii) The calcareous dolomitic Turonian is a confined aquifer under the Senonian marls in the and in direct contact with the Plio-Quaternary. For a few years, the drinking water supply to the town of Essaouira has come from deep drillings. These two aquifers were sampled in June 1995 and in January 1996 after exceptional rainfalls. All waters have the same geochernical profile. The interpretation of the total dissolved solids and chloride content of Plio-Quaternary aquifers makes it possible to specify their origins. It emphasises, in particular, the source from the Ksob Wadi in the northeast and the role of the hidden Essaouira diapir. Nitrate levels were raised excessively, increasing at the same time as chloride concentrations during the rains of the winter of 1996, and underline the wells vulnerability to pastoral and domestic activities. The interpretation of O- and H-isotopes distinguishes two contrasting Plio-Quaternary and Turonian aquifers with an Atlantic origin for the rain recharge.

6229e1985aee126c0f00d78d,Borate Deposits of Turkey and Argentina; A Summary and Geological Comparison,,"[{'name': 'Cahit Helvaci Ricardo N. Alonso', 'org': 'Dokuz Eylül University', 'orgs': ['Dokuz Eylül University']}]","Turkey has the largest borate reserves in the world and Argentina is in third place. Both countries have calcium and sodium borate deposits where colemanite, ulexite and borax are the principal minerals. We present here a comparison of the main borate deposits interlayered in continental Miocene volcaniclastic rocks of the Anatolian plateau (Turkey) and those of the Puna high plateau (Argentina). The main borate deposits of Turkey are at Emet, Bigadic, Kestelek and Kirka. Emet is in the western part of the Kutahya province. In Emet, a sedimentary lacustrine sequence rich in tuffaceous materials hosts the colemanite section. There are limestones and marl layers at the base and top of the borate section. Arsenic minerals (realgar and orpiment) are very abundant and spatially related to the borates, indicating a common genetic origin. The principal borate mineral is colemanite with minor ulexite, hydroboracite, meyerhofferite, and rarer species such as veatchite-A, tunellite, teruggite and cahnite. Colemanite occurs as nodules of different sizes, agglomerated in thick beds. Bigadic has borates interbedded with tuffs, clay and limestone layers. The borate minerals are formed in two distinct zones, lower and upper, separated by thick tuff beds. Colemanite and ulexite predominate in both borate zones. Other borates include howlite, probertite and hydroboracite in the lower zone, and inyoite, meyerhofferite, pandermite (priceite), terschite, hydroboracite, howlite, tunellite and rivadavite in the upper borate zone. The Kestelek deposit is 27 km southeast of the town of Mustafa Kemalpasa in the province of Bursa. The borate zone consists of marl, limestone, tuffaceous limestone, tuff and borate layers. The borate minerals occur interbedded with clay minerals. Colemanite is present as masses from nodule to boulder size (up to 1 m in diameter), and as thin layers of fibrous and euhedral crystals. Colemanite, ulexite and probertite predominate and sparse hydroboracite is also present locally. The Kirka stratigraphic succession comprises borates that are intimately interbedded with and penetrating marls, claystones, zeolitized tuff and tuffaceous epiclastic material in the lacustrine sedimentary rocks. The main boron mineral is borax with lesser amounts of colemanite, ulexite and other borate minerals. The volcano-sedimentary rock units in the Sultancayir deposit include borate-bearing gypsum intercalated in a sandy claystone unit. Calcium borates, mainly pandermite (priceite) and howlite, but also colemanite and bakerite, are interspersed within the Sultancayir gypsum. The borates in all of these districts occur in older playa lake deposits of Miocene age that rest unconformably on a Paleozoic and Mesozoic basement that is comprised of ophiolites, marbles and schists. Argentina has lacustrine borate deposits restricted to 1) Sijes hill in the Los Andes districts of the Salta province, 2) the Loma Blanca deposits of the Jujuy province and 3) the Tincalayu deposit located on the northwestern margin of the Hombre Muerto Salar. There are also several borate occurrences within salars of the Andes region. Sijes hill is a topographically positive area of Miocene rocks, 30 km long, along the eastern border of the Pastos Grandes salt pan. Borates occur as interbeds in a very thick lacustrine volcaniclastic sequence. Several evaporitic members, with halite at the bottom and borate and gypsum at the middle and top, are interlayered with tuffs and tuffaceous materials. Colemanite is the main borate mineral at the Monte Verde, Esperanza and Santa Rosa mines. Other deposits are composed principally of mainly hydroboracite, the principal borate mineral in the Sijes district. Colemanite occurs as spherules agglomerated in beds less than 1 m thick and is accompanied by hydroboracite, inyoite and ulexite. Predominantly borax and trace amounts of colemanite, ulexite and other borate minerals are also present in the Loma Blanca deposit of the Jujuy province, and in the Tincalayu deposit.",,

A fluvio-lacustrine system emplaced in the basin and resulted in a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedimentation in which microbial and metazoan buildups occupy an important place. However, microbial deposits are not exclusive to the Cenozoic history of the Limagne Basin; nowadays, in the basin, they still form in association with thermal spring systems. A fieldtrip was carried out in the Limagne Basin as part of the Microbialites: formation, evolution and diagenesis (M-Fed) meeting (October 2019). The objective of this excursion was to assess the diversity of modern and fossil (Chattian to Aquitanian) microbial sediments and structures in three prime locations (the Jussat and Chadrat outcrops and the Grand Gandaillat quarry). A detailed description of the morphologies and fabrics of the buildups and their associated biotic components can be used to discuss the spatio-temporal distribution pattern. Different basin margin models are proposed based on the changes in the distribution, morphology and size of the microbial and metazoan-rich deposits through time. The Jussat outcrop offers novel perspectives to unravel the evolution of the lacustrine/palustrine cycles over time and to establish a long-term paleoenvironmental history of the western margin of the basin during the Aquitanian. These cycles are composed of (i) lacustrine sedimentation comprising microbial and metazoan buildups and organic matter-rich marls reflecting a period of high accommodation, and (ii) palustrine deposits made of mudstones and clayey paleosoils, indicative of a period of low accommodation. It is suggested that climatic, tectonic, volcanic and local parameters (physiography, substrate) control the deposition of the buildups in each of the different cycles. In addition, the modern microbial mats of the Sainte-Marguerite and La Poix outcrops offer an opportunity to constrain the controlling processes at the origin of the mineralization involved in the formation of the microbialites and their preservation in the fossil record.",,

The basin evolved south of the magmatic arc (Gangdise belt) of the Lhasa block on top of trapped oceanic or transitional crust. Remnants of shelf carbonates are preserved along the northern edge of the basin. The mapped segment was shortened by about 65%; metamorphism reached low-grade conditions along the northern margin of the basin. The flysch sequence reaches a thickness of at least 5 km and consists to a large degree of volcaniclastic (andesitic to dacitic) material shed from the magmatic-arc Gangdise belt. Particularly in the western part of the study area, plutonic and sedimentary rocks from deep erosion levels and/or more distal sources contributed to the basin fill. Rivers from the Lhasa block acted as point sources and fed five major deep-sea channel systems. Turbidity currents in the channels were directed towards the growing accretionary wedge of the subduction zone, thus indicating that the basin was continuously filled up to outer ridge level and gradually shallowing. The forearc flysch is subdivided into at least three megasequences, which begin with wide (up to several km) incised (10 to 50 m), coarse-grained channel fills and their associated fan deposits. The upper parts of the megasequences contain hemipelagic dark shales and marls (deposited above the calcite compensation depth). Lateral channel migration, channel-lobe switching, but also volcanic pulses generated a predominantly fining-upward, high-frequency cyclicity. After continental collision, the marine sedimentation in the forearc basin was replaced by fluvial deposits of the Eocene-Oligocene Qiuwu formation, which is time-equivalent to the Kailas and Indus molasses farther west and rich in coarse gravel derived from the Gangdise belt. Both forearc flysch and Qiuwu formation were deformed simultaneously during the Miocene. We assume that the molasse-type Qiuwu formation represents the final continental facies of the forearc basin filling.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/9E/40/F0/9E40F0D2AC92FB5ED9D5C0D30DFF4744.pdf

Based on semi-quantitative measurements of test shape parameters from different stratigraphic levels, four categories of test shape were recognized, whereby the flattened lenticular and subglobular tests predominate in the marl and arenaceous marlite while lenticular and inflated lenticular tests show wide distribution. Based on test shape and host lithology, four morphogroups (A-D) are recognized. Morphogroup-A comprising flattened lenticular tests with thin lateral walls, closely spaced short vertical pillars and low apertural face thrived on the soft substrate towards the lower part of the photic zone. Morphogroup-D, characterized by subglobular tests with thick lateral wall, long thick vertical pillars and high apertural face, dwelled on the hard substrate towards at the upper part of the photic zone where high energy and sufficient light prevailed. Morphogroup-B and morphogroup-C comprising respectively of lenticular and inflated lenticular forms generally thrived between the upper (shallow) to lower (deep) levels of the photic zone, though the former dominated on the soft substrate and the latter on the hard substrate.

Biotic turnover in benthic foraminifera across the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary at E1 Kef, Tunisia, Palaeogeogr., Palaeoclimatol., Palaeoecol., 66:153 171. The Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary section exposed near E1 Kef, Tunisia is the most complete boundary sequence known to date. It contains nearly I m of black and gray boundary clay containing planktic foraminiferal Zone POa, b, 2 m of clayey shales of P la (Globigerina eugubina) Zone and 4 m of shales and marls of Plb (G. taurica) Zone. Quantitative analysis of the benthic foraminiferal fauna suggests that deposition during the latest Cretaceous occurred in an upper slope to outer shelf environment which shallowed at the K/T boundary to an outer to middle shelf depth and shallowed further by Plb time to mid-shelf depth. A maj or reduction in benthic diversity occurred near the K/T boundary with about 50% of the fauna disappearing. Diversity remained an average of 37% lower during deposition of the first 3 m of sediment above the boundary (POa, b Pla) and productivity was very low. Surviving and thriving foraminifers during this interval were primarily low oxygen tolerant epifaunal and infaunal species. A sharp decrease in the low oxygen tolerant fauna and appearance of a shallow mid-shelf fauna at about 4 m above the boundary (Plb Zone) signals a second regression, return to higher oxygen levels and higher productivity. Although the environmental effects of the K/T boundary event can be inferred from benthic faunas, the ultimate cause remains elusive. Faunal changes prior to and the long recovery period after the K/T boundary are difficult to explain by a single impact hypothesis.",,

The heat denaturation of major membrane proteins, spectrin and the anion channel, is not needed for the thermoporation which is involved in thermohemolysis. This study reports about the surface and shape changes which are specific for thermoporated membranes with spectrin and anion channel preserved intact. Thermoporation was produced exposing human erythrocytes to 39.5 degrees C for 3 min in isotonic medium containing 18% (v/v) ethanol as membrane fluidizer and sucrose as osmotic protectant which prevents hemolysis (Ivanov, J. Therm. Biol. 1996). The control cells were processed similarly except that they were incubated at 23 degrees C, thus avoiding thermoporation. In control and porated membranes the overall structure of spectrin and the anion channel was retained inasmuch as their enthalpies and denaturation temperatures were microcalorimetrically found preserved. Nevertheless, irregular shape, grainy surface and asymmetric spicules were apparent in porated cells through scanning electron microscopy. A decrease in the number of binding sites for Alcian blue and an increased binding of eosine was established in the membranes of porated cells. After poration the hexane/aqueous partition coefficient K-d of cells increased from 5 to about 220 and the electrophoretic mobility of cells decreased by about 25% indicating marl;ed increase in cell surface hydrophobicity and a decrease in surface charge, respectively. In addition, adhesivity to hydrophobic interfaces and aggregability in low ionic media strongly increased after poration. In contrast to intact and control cells, the porated ones (all prefixed with 0.2% glutaraldehyde) made molecular contacts with inclined hydrophobic interfaces at low (5 mM NaCl) but not at high (150 mM NaCl) ionic media. Thus, the microtopological shape changes and exposure of new hydrophobic and charge groups over the outer cell surface, without major thermal unfolding, possibly indicates an irreversible redistribution of membrane material and disturbed lipid-protein complementation during thermoporation.

This time represents a main step in the Alps-Apennines evolution characterized by several geodynamic events such as the Voltri Group exhumation or the development of the Calk-alcaline volcanism The Aveto succession represents a complex depositional system outcropping in the Northern Apennines located, in the palinspastic reconstructions, between the Mesoalpine belt and the Tuscan Domain. The occurrence of andesitic debris in the Aveto succession can be considered a fondamental tool to understand the geodynamic processes that occurred in the Alps-Apennines linkage area. The Aveto succession is characterized by an almost 500m thick turbiditic sequence (the so-called Aveto Formation) characterized by andesitic-bearing coarse grained arenites and conglomerates. The age of this succession has been determined using Nannofossils assemblage that indicates the biozone MNP23 (Early Oligocene). An age of 32ma (Early Oligocene) has been also provided by radiometric datings on the andesitic clasts. Up to now the basement and the top of the Aveto succession have never been recognized because of pervasive deformations related to the the thrusting of the Liguride units onto the Subligurian and Tuscan ones. New biostratigraphic and field data, derived from the new 1:50.000 italian mapping project, have evidenced, the presence of a new stratigraphic unit at the top of Aveto succession cropping out in the Trebbia Valley. This unit is characterized by a sudden change in the sedimentary facies with development of choesive debris flow characterized by the occurence of ophiolitic fragments.The ophiolitic debris is made up of serpentinized peridotites, basalts, radiolarites and limestones of Late Cretaceous-Paleocene age. According to theirs age, petrographic features and absence of metamorphism, these clast can be related to a typical Liguride succession that characterize the tectonic units above the Aveto unit (e.g. Vico, Ottone, Gottero and Antola units). Nannofossils data indicate an Early Oligocene age (MNP23) for the marls associate with the debris flow deposits. The ophiolitic fragments recognized in the debris flow deposits at the top of the Aveto succession indicate that the sedimentation in the Aveto-Subligurian basin has been stopped by the emplacement of the Liguride Units during the Early Oligocene (MNP23). This type of tectono-sedimentary evolution is typical of the chain-foredeep system of the Northern Apennines, where the foredeep sedimentation was interrupted by the emplacement of tectonic units derived from the orogenic belt. Differently from the previuos reconstructions, where the Macigno Formation.(Late Oligocene -Early Miocene) was regarded as first and oldest foredeep deposit, the collected data indicate that the Aveto-Subligurian basin can be regarded as a true Apennine foredeep of Early Oligocene age.",,

By conventional flash pyrolysis the Frenelopsis remains released mainly alkyl-substituted phenols and polyaromatic compounds, whereas the organic matter from the lignitiferous layer is dominated by phenols and that from the carbonaceous marls by polycyclic and aliphatic compounds. Pyrolysis-thermochemolysis alkylation in the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) allowed the detection of additional diagnostic compounds, such as series of methylated fatty acids, benzenecarboxylic and phenolic acids, which revealed further differences between the three materials studied. The chemical characterization of the organic matter in addition to the micropalaeontological study suggests that the Frenelopsis remains consist mainly of heavily altered lignin and cuticular lipid biomacromolecules, whereas the materials from the lignitiferous layers and the carbonaceous marls correspond to intermediate coalification stages of woody plants, the latter showing the greatest degree of selective preservation of aliphatic structures. The comparison of the above results with those obtained by thermochemolysis suggests that the latter technique produces independent and complementary reactions to conventional pyrolysis, providing additional information to an extent which depends mainly on the polyalkyl and oxidized character of the sample.",,

Sections chosen for this study are from the Helvetic nappes of the Swiss Alps, from the Jura Mountains, from the Provence (France) and from the Southern Alps (N. Italy). The limestones and marls used for this isotope geochemical investigation were deposited along the northern (Helvetics, Jura, Provence) and the southern (S. Alps) margin of the Alpine Tethys. Isotope curves were first established in well-dated sections of the Jura Mountains, the Southern Alps and the Vocontian Basin. Isotope curves generated from the poorly dated Helvetic nappe sections could then be correlated with the bisotratigraphically dated sections. This comparison produces greatly improved age control for the Helvetic sections and a more detailed composite delta(13)C curve for the Late Jurassic than has been published previously. The composite delta(13)C curve features two short-lived negative excursions in the Oxfordian, a delta(13)C maximum in the Late Kimmeridgian and steadily decreasing delta(13)C values throughout the Tithonian. These delta(13)C events are consistent with previous, lower resolution data sets and are valuable tie-points. which can be used for correlating upper Jurassic successions among different lithologies and across different depositional settings. The new carbon isotope record is not only useful as a stratigraphic tool but it records fluctuations in Late Jurassic global carbon cycling. The negative carbon isotope events lasting up to a few 10(5) years are interpreted as primary perturbation signals recording anomalies in the atmospheric and marine carbon reservoirs. The perturbations of the global C-cycle were triggered by a sudden and massive release of methane stored in deep-sea gas hydrates.

It consists of mixed, coarse- to fine-grained siliciclastic and carbonate strata deposited in deep- to shallow-marine, and locally non-marine, settings along the post-rift continental margin of the Kalahari Craton prior to the onset of foreland basin sedimentation recorded by the overlying terminal Neoproterozoic-Cambrian Nama Group. No direct age constrains exist for the Witvlei Group, but it post-dates c. 800 Ma rift-related rocks and pre-dates the c. 548 Ma base of the Nama Group, thereby placing it as Cryogenian to Ediacaran in age. The Witvlei Group consists of three main units, from oldest to youngest, the Blaubeker, Court and Buschmannsklippe Formations. The Blaubeker Formation is highly variable in thickness and can be as much as 1000 m thick. It consists mostly of massive, polymict diamictite and, in the area of the type locality, contains conglomerate and pebbly sandstone beds. The diamictic strata combined with the presence of numerous faceted and striated clasts provide the evidence for glaciogenic influences on sedimentation. The highly variable thickness pattern likely reflects the infill of palaeo-valleys formed by the deep erosion and scouring of bedrock by ice, and the conglomerates and pebbly sandstones record glacial outwash processes. The Tahiti Formation is a locally developed, fine-grained sandstone above the Blaubeker Formation. It is poorly exposed and its exact stratigraphic relationship to the Blaubeker rocks and overlying Court Formation remains to be determined. The Blaubeker rocks are overlain sharply by the basal unit of the Court Formation, the Gobabis Member. This Member is from 20 to 60 m thick and consists mostly of dark and light grey laminated dolostones that display a delta C-13(carbonate) profile that rises from values of -4 parts per thousand in the lowermost beds to values of 5 parts per thousand In the topmost. The Gobabis Member is conformably overlain by the shales, marls and thin limestones of the Constance Member followed by quartzites of the uppermost unit of the Court Formation, the Simmenau Member. The basal unit of the Buschmannsklippe Formation is the light to tan and pink grey dolostone of the Bildah Member. Its basal contact is sharp everywhere, and it is gradationally overlain by a coarsening (shoaling) upward succession from shales, thin limestones (some exhibiting formerly aragonitic fans) and fine sandstones of the La Fraque Member, to interbedded quartzites and stromatolitic and cherty dolostones of the Okambara Member. The delta C-13(carbonate) profile for the Buschmannsklippe rocks shows that the basal beds of the Bildah Member begin at -4 parts per thousand, followed by a decline to -6 parts per thousand in the lower La Fraque limestones and then a rise to -3 parts per thousand in the dolostones of the Okambara Member before being truncated by the base of the regionally unconformably overlying basal Weissberg Quartzite Member of the lower Nama Group. Although no glacial sediments have been recognized below the Bildah Member, its lithofacies character, stratigraphic position and C-isotopic profile are compatible with and strikingly similar to younger Cryogenian cap carbonates. Thus, the Witvlei Group arguably contains both the older and younger cap carbonates of Neoproterozoic time, but only the older Cryogenian glacial deposit.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/2B/EA/51/2BEA5143D90A30C027680FBC3C68895F.pdf

Calculation of natural recharge in large areas, as a function of lithology and rainfall. Water Technology and Sciences (in Spanish). Vol. IV, No. 1, January-March, 2013, pp. 195-202. In a region as large as Spain, annual mean recharge is shown to be a fixed proportion of the mean rainfall for each lithology. This determination is based on statistical inferences from a complete sample of 875 springs for which mean flow and catchment areas are known and which have been grouped into distinct rainfall regions. Recharge rates have thus been established with respect to rainfall for six lithological groups with different permeability: sands, gravels and generally alluvial formations, 8.3%; conglomerates, 5.6%; sandstones, 7.3%; limestone and dolomite 34.3%; marls, marly limestones, silts and clays, 3.3%; and hard rocks, 1.3%. Considering the representativeness of Spain, which is large in size and has a highly varied lithology, topography and rainfall, these recharge rates for rainfall are probably quasi-universal values that can be used to estimate average recharge or average groundwater resources of large regions in any part of the world (except in special cases such as areas with permafrost, for example). For any case, these recharge rates can be adapted to each region according to its particular characteristics. Rainfall and lithology data are very common, and so the method can be widely used to calculate hydraulic balances.",,

This preliminary note concentrates on the Tournaisian-Serpukhovian interval. It primarily deals with the sedimentation and the microfossils of the southern part of the basin. Moreover, sedimentological and micropaleontological data are also provided for the northern and central part. Sedimentological study enables recognition of 12 microfacies ranging from open marine below storm wave action to supratidal with continental influx. The proposed model is that of a homoclinal ramp marl-sandstone-limestone interrupted by numerous tempestites. Sedimentary cycles in the Late Visean are particularly numerous. Calcareous algae are mostly Stacheiinae and benthic foraminifers, Archaediscidae and Endothyridae. The prolific Late Visean assemblages become scarce in the Serpukhovian and peter out in the Bashkirian. This reflects the progression from a marine ramp to a paralic basin. We propose a regional biostratigraphic scale based on the biozones of MAMET (1974) and of LYS (1986) which are correlated with those of Conil in CONIL et al (1990).",,

Their boundaries represent times of complete exposure of the platform with accompanying karstification and fluvial erosion. Relative sea level falls of 15-50 m have been estimated from depths of erosion or from diagenetic effects on platform materials and facies analysis. During lowstands, deposits of the corresponding systems tract onlapped the platform foreslope or filled incised valleys on the platform top. These deposits comprise a variety of facies: limestone megabreccias derived from the platform margin, allodapic grainstones, hemipelagic marls, fine-grained turbiditic sandstones, basinal lutites, fine-grained estuarine sandstones; bank bafflestones and grainstones, fluvio-deltaic pebbly conglomerates and sandstones, and shallow water orbitolinid grainstones. Relative sea level rises were characterized by deposition of monotonous marls in the basin, and by the growth of coral-rudist mud mounds and accumulations of skeletal grainstones and marls, sometimes with back-stepping stacking, on the platform. During highstands, hemipelagic marls and prodeltaic and talus delta lutites and sandstones dominated in the basin, whereas coral wackestones and orbitolinid grainstones, sometimes with prograding clinoforms, dominated on the platform. Transgressive surfaces have erosion or simply omission features, such as pebble lags or numerous burrows, respectively. No well-developed condensed sections exist, and they are represented by thin beds of marls rich in orbitolinids. Transgressive and highstand systems tracts are normally difficult to differentiate, both in the basin and on the platform, but in sequences with an accused wedge shape, the presence of back-stepping and prograding stacking patterns makes it easier. Four main types of sequences are documented, based on geometrical characteristics. Three of them are continuous from the platform to the basin: tabular, wedge shaped with tilted base, and wedge shaped with incised base. The fourth type (scalloped) is discontinuous from the platform to the basin. It results from the collapse of the platform margin, whose debris contributed to form the following sequence, and the unveiling of the underlying sequence at the site of collapse. Most of the sequence boundaries suggest a tectonic influence, and three of them show angular unconformities in the basin margin and/or the inner platform. These angular unconformities show major erosional vacuities at the cores of anticlines on the inner platform. They are attributed to phases of accentuated transpression in a major strike-slip tectonosedimentary environment, related to the opening of Bay of Biscay.

Vein type, base and/or precious metal deposits are also common and some are spatially associated with PCDs. Latala and Chahmessi are vein type, base and precious metal deposits in the north and southwest Miduk deposit. The area is covered mainly by Paleocene- Eocene volcanic and pyroclastic rocks of basaltic, basaltic-andesitic and trachy-andesitic compositions, and minor marls and limestones. The volcanic and pyroclastic rocks are intruded by Miocene shallow intrusions of quartz diorite, quartz monzonite and granodiorite compositions.The rocks are host to a set of ore-bearing quartz veins. Mineralization in both the Chahmessi and Latala deposits are controlled by faults and fractures. The role of the ring structures and faults in the distribution of hydrothermal alteration zones and mineralization is important in the Latala deposit. In these veins, euhedral quartz with sulfide mineralization occurs as open space fillings, minor replacement bodies and hydrothermal breccia. The veins consist of quartz, calcite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite, bornite and minor sulfosalts, particularly enargite. According to studies based on fluid inclusions in the Miduk porphyry, three types of fluids are responsible for mineralization. Homogenization temperatures and salinity in porphyry-type fluids vary from 566 to 162 °C and 61.3 to 1.2 wt% NaCl equiv. For the Latala vein type base and precious metals deposit, homogenization temperature and salinity vary from 380 to 131 °C and 10.6 to 0.17 wt% NaCl equiv. The gas phase in fluid inclusions of Latala is dominated by CO2 but also shows the presence of CO and H2, characterizing reducing conditions associated with ore deposition. The change from lithostatic to hydrostatic regime, boiling and fluid dilution associated with the introduction of meteoric fluids provides an explanation for the widespread Th and salinity data. Calculated pressure for examples of Miduk fluid inclusions varies from 700 to 200 bars. These pressures correspond to depths of 2500 to 1500 metres for porphyry mineralization. The three-phase fluid inclusions, corresponding to magmatic fluid, show the highest pressure. The Latala base and precious metals deposit has formed at pressures between 200 and 100 bars, corresponding to a depth of less than 1 km. Sphalerite mineralization occurs in shallow parts of the sedimentary-volcanic sequence from magmatic fluids diluted by meteoric fluids and also occurs in more distal parts of the porphyry. The sulphur isotopic composition for sulfide minerals varies between -9.8 and -1.0‰, which correspond to values of magmatic sulfur. This suggests that magmatic water was responsible for transportation of metals in Latala. Epithermal mineral precipitation occurred upon dilution of the low-salinity magmatic fluid with meteoric water, which entered the hydrothermal system as it cooled and successively diluted during continued magmatic fluid ascent.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/C1/60/12/C1601209BD55221F8AD1E0EBF2DC8DD9.pdf

However, detailed mapping linked to limited subsurface data can provide the first approximation of a ground model in some situations. In this example mapping was carried out at the location of the proposal Channel Tunnel portal at Castle Hill near Folkestone, England, prior to any detailed ground investigations with the aim of establishing the nature and extent of the landslide complex that existed at the site. Full details of the study can be found in Griffiths et al. 1995.The siteThe Channel Tunnel terminal and portal on the UK side is located immediately below the Etchinghill escarpment, a scarp slope developed in the Lower Chalk of the North Downs to the west of Folkestone. Whilst the tunnel itself was positioned within the lower permeability zone of the Chalk Marl, the works for the terminal and portal required excavations in the Lower Chalk, the underlying Gault Clay and through the solifluction cover of Coombe Rock.The 1: 10 560 scale BGS map identified six landslide complexes within the terminal and portal works area (Aarons et al. 1977), although there was no information available on the form, depth and current stability of these features. The design for the main tunnel portal, however, required it to enter the hillside through the centre of one of the landslides at Castle Hill.Techniques usedField mapping of the geomorphology was undertaken at a scale of 1: 500 using standard procedures for geomorphological survey work (Brunsden et al. 1975).",,

This deposition scenario is indicated by multiple horizons of bioturbation within the top unit 3 and near the base of the middle unit 2; the presence of thin layers enriched in fine clayminerals and planktic foraminifera, suggesting hemipelagic sedimentation within unit 3; the presence of a marl layer of Maastrichtian age above the clastic deposit; the occurrence of distinct layers enriched in zeolites in unit 3; and the presence of lithologically, sedimentologically, and mineralogically distinct units and subunits that are correlatable over more than 300 km. Such correlations do not support a chaotic deposition as predicted for an impact-generated tsunami event. We interpret the clastic beds of northeastern Mexico as having accumulated during the major eustatic sealevel lowstand near the end of the Maastrichtian. In this scenario, the unconformity at the base of the clastic deposit represents a type 1 sequence boundary, where deltaic sediments were eroded and transported into deeper waters, depositing the spherulerich layer of unit 1. Continued sea-level lowering resulted in erosion and bypass of shelf sediments and the deposition of the sandstone of unit 2. Subsequently, stabilization of the sea-level lowstand resulted in episodes of decreased erosion and sediment transport alternating with normal hemipelagic sedimentation, thus depositing the sand and the silt and shale layers of unit 3. The sea-level rise during the last 50 to 100 k.y. of the Maastrichtian resulted in the normal hemipelagic sedimentation observed in the pre–K/T boundary marl layer above the clastic deposit.

The most relevant two are located in the NE margin, in different lithostratigraphic units. Their diatom flora is dominated by Epithemia adnata and Epithemia turgida, a littoral epiphytic aquatic plants. These diatom assemblages are typical of fresh to slightly brackish waters in shallow and alkaline lakes. Those two diatomitic deposits are interstratified between alluvial sediments and represent permanent shallow lakes developed during two wet periods of time. Barranco de las Lumbres is the oldest of these lake events and is dated by fauna and paleomagnetism as late Miocene (Turolian). The upper beds of the younger lake episode (Rincon de la Losa) is dated by paleomagnetism and mammals at 1.9 Ma. In addition to these marginal diatomitic deposits, other outcrops with diatoms have been identified in more central areas of the Basin in Galera village, the lower part of Barranco del Agua section is composed of gypsum, carbonates and dark-brown clays and marls. Here epiphytic shallow-water diatoms Epithemia adnata, Epithemia turgida and some planktonic littoral forms (Fragilaria sp.) suggest a shallow fresh to oligosaline water environment. Additional diatomaceous deposits were located in a more evaporitic zone of the basin near the town of Castillejar. This outcrop presents species (Navicula digitoradiata and Surirella ovalis), which indicate distinctive more saline waters and environment. The distribution of the diatom flora in the Baza basin is consistent with stratigraphic data, which indicates an increase of evaporitic facies towards the center of the basin and the occurrence of different kinds of waters within the lake system. The isotopic composition (delta S-34, delta O-18) of the gypsum samples of Baza basin (Gibert et al., 2007a) is consistent with a Triassic origin of the sulphate as a result of chemical recycling. These data also suggest that a similar recycling mechanism operated in the saline lake system, where the gypsum sediments from the margins were coevally recycled towards the inner part.",,

Fifty-two rock samples were collected from the 270 m thick section which is made up of dark shales with intercalations of marl and limestones, and treated palynologically. Three palynofacies were differentiated based on statistical studies of palynological slides and the rock samples representing these palynofacies were geochemically analyzed. Palynofacies results were then correlated against the geochemical analysis. Palynofacies I (PF-1) with 90 to 100% Amorphous Organic Matter (AOM) presents high hydrogen index (HI) and total organic carbon (TOC) values. PF-1 contains kerogen type I/II and could potentially produce oil. The second palynofacies (PF-2) contains reduced amounts of AOM, HI and TOC and the kerogen is of type II/III, potentially producing oil and gas. Palynofacies III (PF-3) was recognized in a few samples and is characterized by low amounts of AOM, HI and TOC potentially producing meager amount of gas and oil. Plotting palynological data on Tyson ternary diagrams and Van Krevelen geochemical diagrams confirm that the kerogen is of type II/III, III and is originated mainly from algal organic matter. Potential for hydrocarbon generation is high for the samples falling in palynofacies I which contains high amount of kerogen type II while it is relatively good for samples representing palynofacies II with high amounts of kerogen type II, III. Tmax indicates that the samples are mainly mature or have entered the mature phase and are potentially able to produce oil and gas. The high amounts of clear AOM in most samples indicate dominance of redox environmental condition with low oxygen content.

To investigate land use and land use change effects on the water balance a distributed water balance model (WaSiM- ETH), following the TOPMODEL approach, was applied to the watershed of the upper Guadalentin river, located in Southeast Spain, Province of Murcia. It is pointed out, that rainfed land use establishes improved soil moisture conditions with higher rates of baseflow and interflow and groundwater recharge, whereas intensive farming has a negative influence on the water balance. 1 INTRODUCTION In the semi-arid southeast of the Iberian Peninsula human impact causes degradation of vegetation cover since Neolithic times. As a consequence potential possible vegetation cover hardly exists anymore and degraded Mediterranean vegetation communities are dominating today's land surface. In this area agriculture is the most important economic factor until today, which in the recent past shifted into a more water consuming agriculture under the policy of the European Union. At the same time the European ""Water Resources Directive"" demands for a sustainable use of resources. In dryland environments water is the limiting factor for farming. Due to the semi-arid climatic conditions given in the Guadalentin drainage basin - the area of investigaton discussed in this paper - in combination with the extreme changes in land use in the most recent past the area offers ideal possibilities to evaluate the capability of watershed environments in respect to human impact and the limitations of human use to ensure sustainability. Vegetation and land cover are in an influential position within the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system and predominantly control the water balance. To verify the present role of land cover in respect to the water balance a distributed water balance model was applied in a first step and calibrated by integrating discharge data from gauging stations located along the upper Guadalentin river, Province of Murcia, SE Spain. The modelling approach allows for an estimation of the spatial and temporal distribution of natural water resources under the actual climatic and land cover conditions. Based upon the results different land cover scenarios are implemented. Measures for a sustainable watershed management in respect to land and water use are recommended as a result. 2 THE UPPER GUADALENTIN RIVER BASIN The catchment of the upper Guadalentin River is located in Southeast Spain (Figure 1)and is one of the major tributaries of the Segura River, which drains into the Mediterranean Sea. And the latter is the most important water source for the Murcia region with its intensive agriculture. Most tributaries of the Guadalentin River are ephemeral streams, whereas only the main course is periodic to perennial. The entire basin covers an area of approximately 3300 km2. The Guadalentin River originates from the southeastern margin of the Betic Cordilleras. Lithology of the drainage is dominated by limestone and marls of Jurassic to Tertiary age, locally, in its most southeastern part Paleozoic phyllites are outcropping. Relief of the Guadalentin drainage basin ranges from high mountainous character in the headwater area to a steep undulating relief along its middle course into a coastal plain in its lower reach. Cambisoles, Regosoles and Xerosoles dominate the overall pedological conditions, with medium to high water permeability.",,

In the deeper parts of the basin, box cores typically recovered a flocculent surface layer (""fluff""), laminated coccolith marls of Unit I (25-45 cm thick), and the upper 5-10 cm of finely laminated, dark-colored sapropels of Unit II. Fine-grained, homogeneous mud turbidites are interbedded with Units I and II over much of the basin, but the stratigraphic position of these turbidites differs. from site to site. The deposition of individual turbidites up to 15 cm thick does not appear to have significantly disturbed underlying laminae. Sediment trap deployments in the Black Sea suggest that light and dark laminae couplets represent annual increments of sedimentation (i.e., varves); we have therefore constructed a varve chronology for the sequence in order to correlate and date distinctive sedimentation and paleoenvironmental events. Distinctive groups of laminae in Unit I can be correlated across the entire deeper basin (a distance of more than 1000 km). This implies a remarkable homogeneity in production, accumulation, and preservation of biogenic material over much of the Black Sea during deposition of Unit I. The change from deposition of finely laminated, organic carbon-rich sapropels (Unit II) to laminated, more calcareous, coccolith-rich marls (Unit I) is thought to represent the crossing of a salinity threshold for Emiliania huxleyi. The varve chronology sets this change at about 1.63 ka (1633+/-100 yr B.P.), but the record of magnetic secular variation measured in several cores produces an age estimate of about 2.0 ka for the base of Unit I, or about 1.2 times the varve age. The average of six calibrated accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon ages for the base of Unit I is 2.7 ka, or about 1.7 times the varve age. Following the initial change to coccolith-dominated sedimentation, deposition of sapropel resumed for at least one significant period, 1.56-1.25 ka. Since 1.25 ka, cycles of carbonate deposition with quasi-decadal periodicities have produced characteristic darker and lighter assemblages of laminae. These cycles may have been climatically driven. Geochemical analyses coupled with the varve ages adopted herein indicate that accumulation rates of carbonate are nearly an order of magnitude higher in Unit I (averaging 35-45 g m-2 yr-1) than in sapropelic Unit II, which contains primarily detrital carbonate. The accumulation of lithogenic components in parts of Unit I is only 1.5 times the rate in Unit II. Deepwater organic carbon accumulation rates are somewhat higher in Unit 1 (3.5-4.5 g m-2yr-1) than in the upper part of Unit II. Organic carbon accumulation rates in Unit I are somewhat antithetic to those of carbonate, and on the basis of this and additional constraints placed by pyrolysis and carbon isotopic analyses of organic material, it appears that terrestrial organic matter is an important component (perhaps >25%) of total organic carbon burial in the basin. Unit I in the western part of the Black Sea has a higher terrestrial organic component and higher accumulation rates of terrigenous clastic material than Unit I in the eastern part. This difference between eastern and western Black Sea is to be expected because of the major rivers that empty into the western Black Sea from eastern Europe, Ukraine, and Russia. Shallow slope sites, but still within euxinic bottom waters, have lower organic carbon accumulation rates and lower pyrolysis hydrogen indices than deepwater basinal sites, suggesting selective resuspension and oxidation of organic matter at basin margins and focusing of organic matter deposition toward the basin center. A comparison of the Black Sea data with those from several open-ocean sites with similar water depths showed no significant difference between organic carbon accumulation rates under oxic and anoxic conditions. For a given bulk accumulation rate the organic carbon accumulation rates, normalized to primary productivity, are about the same in both settings.",,

A second possibility is that the sapropels formed as a consequence of higher settling fluxes of organic matter caused by increased primary production connected with the increased runoff5,6. Here we report that in a sediment core from close to the mouth of the Nile, the sapropels have significantly lighter nitrogen isotope ratios (N-15/N-14) than the intercalated marl oozes. We adduce evidence that these large differences cannot be caused either by variable mixtures of marine and terrestrial organic matter having different isotopic compositions, or by differences in the extent and type of post-depositional alteration. The differences are consistent, however, with a higher utilization of dissolved nitrate during sapropel formation, implying that the sapropels were ultimately formed as a consequence of high plankton production, which led to high fluxes of organic Matter to the sea floor.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/F7/10/A8/F710A84C61E3822C1F0DFE5ACFC11431.pdf

Alteration temperatures were estimated to be in the range from 30 degrees to 90 degrees C. In addition, delta(18)O and delta(13)C ratios were also measured on calcite separated from the bentonites. Dissolution of carbonates in the overlying marl and reprecipitation in the bentonite/pyroclastic rocks is considered as the origin of most of the calcites. In consequence of this polyphase history, delta(13)C-values indicate a marine carbon source while delta(18)O ratios suggest equilibrium of calcite with a fluid phase at elevated temperatures. Isotopic data of smectites and calcite point to similar conditions for the formation of both minerals.

The study, performed in a small mountain catchment (45 ha) with a dense network of badlands (9 ha), is focused in the election and control of some physical variables that allow the temporal comparison of surface regolith development and that can be considered as weathering indicators of the marls. The results validate the methodology in use, favouring processes description, their chronological sequence and their relationship with climatic and topographic parameters. The development and dynamics of regolith on the north-facing slope is more active than on the south-facing slope. On the north-facing slope freeze-thawing are the main weathering processes, while on the south-facing slope prevails the crusting development associated to wetting-drying processes.

Reactive grains show an evident zonation with fractured cores and more compact rims. ASR produced mobilization of alkalies towards the interior of reactive grains coupled with mobilisation of Ca2+ ions wich re-precipitate and react with alkali-silica rich fluids to produce a hard rim.

The biotas reveal extinction and origination events that are known elsewhere, although other species may be involved. The palaeontological evidence suggests a control of global changes on the biotas (macroevolutionary impact of the Oceanic Anoxic Event), rather than changes in the local environmental conditions. Carbon isotopes of inoceramid prisms do not reflect the standard isotope stratigraphy; differences in Vital effects between Inoceramus and Mytiloides probably dominate the isotopic composition. Ridge facies (conglomerates, cliffs, erosional platforms) in Saxony (southeastern Germany) provide evidence of the timing of sea-level changes. The partial derivative(13)C values increase through the section representing a late Cenomanian, long-term sea-level rise, and have a maximum when widespread flooding occurs. Marine erosion (nutrient mobilization) during a long-term sea-level highstand that exceeded previous highstands may have supported higher productivity during the Cenomanian-Turonian Oceanic Anoxic Event, and potentially during other widespread anoxic events in the Mesozoic.

However these data are limited for the soils of south Florida. Also, there are no standard methods for determining soil hydraulic properties such as saturated hydraulic conductivity, erodibility, and water retention values. The objectives of this study were: 1) to calculate soil erodibility using results from rainfall simulation; 2) to compare different methods for calculating soil hydraulic conductivity, soil erodibility, and soil water retention values; and 3) to evaluate how the results from these different methods would affect evapotranspiration, storm water runoff, crop growth, and soil erosion in the model. Three typical soils from the region were used for this study: Krome (sandy loam, moderately well drained), Chekika (silty clay loam, poorly drained), and Perrine Marl (sandy loam, very poorly drained). field research (including model calibration and rainfall simulation) was used to determine soil water parameters. While using various methods to determine soil parameters (calibrated, measured, and estimated) in a hydrologic model, significant discrepancies of simulated hydrologic variables were observed. Therefore, caution should be exercised when predicting critical parameters for hydrologic models. If a model, such as the Everglades Aaro-Hydrology Model (EAHM), is used for comparison of different management practices, slight errors in estimated parameters are acceptable. However if the model is used to assess possible changes in the hydrologic regime of south Florida, the accuracy of simulated values is important and in need of further investigation.",,

The remains were recovered mostly from ca. 170-260 cm below the current land surface in marl overlain by peat and peaty marl. The stratigraphy of the site indicates that the remains were deposited in a small, open-water pond that subsequently filled. The skeleton, which is 41-48% complete, is that of a mature female, ca. 30-34 y old at death based on dental eruption and wear. Postcranial bone measurements indicate that this individual was relatively large for a female. Radiocarbon dating of wood from under the pelvis of the mastodon provided a maximum date of 12,575 +/- 260 C-14 y BP [15,550-13,850 cal y BP] for the animal, which is up to 2575 C-14 y before the species is believed to have become extinct. Pollen samples from the site corroborate the interpretation that the regional climate was cooler and more humid than at present and supported a mixed spruce-deciduous parkland assemblage. The relatively small size of the molars of this and other mastodons from Indiana supports the hypothesis that late-glacial mastodons-just prior to their extinction-were smaller in size relative to earlier, full-glacial conspecifics. The relationship between molar size and body size is not clear, however, and there may be geographical factors as well as a temporal influence to size variation in these animals.",,

The third stage, marked by the emplacement of another prograding deltaic complex, is represented by the Tizi Issoultane Formation, characterised by delta front and delta plain sequences. A comparative study of the El Mers and Skoura depocentres, has shown a different sedimentary evolution during the Middle and Upper Bathonian, and maybe in Callovian times. Facies analysis has shown that the sedimentary successions within the Skoura and El Mers depocentres are different in facies. These sequences mainly end by gypsum and marls in Skoura and by deltaic facies within El Mers depocentre. The Bathonian sediments within these depocentres are interpreted to be the end of the sedimentary evolution within the Middle Atlas trough.",,

The main reason for the slope failure in this part is attributable to softening of clayey-marl soils due to saturation after rainfall. Such soils are distributed extensively in the area. In the present study, analysis of the failed slopes is carried out and the results will be described. The geotechnical parameters involved in the analysis have been obtained mainly from the field observation and laboratory tests, The analysis is particularly useful for the assessment of the factor of safety of existing slopes and the conditions under which other similar slopes in the area may fail. These results may be useful for governmental departments to find appropriate solutions for stabilising the slopes in the area.",,

Four groups of morphotaxa of calcareous dinocysts have been distinguished. They totally dominate the assemblages, and belong to the pithonellids. They are represented by Pithonella sphaerica (Kaufmann in Heer) and P. ovalis (Kaufmann in Heer), which dominate, as well as P. trejoi Bonet and P. lamellata Keupp in Keupp and Kienel, which are less abundant. Two other morphotaxa, Colomisphaera gigantea (Borza) and Cadosina oraviensis Borza, occur sporadically in the assemblages. Both forms represent the calcitarch group, which assembled calcispheres of unknown taxonomic affinity. The calcareous dinocyst and calcitarch diversity is low to moderate, compared to the general species richness known from Late Albian assemblages in other Western Tethyan sections. This is interpreted as a result of nutrient input fluctuations due to changes in the circulation pattern of surface and intermediate waters. The changes in the P. sphaerica/P. ovalis ratio along the Upper Albian section are here correlated with short-term (third-order) sea level fluctuations including transgressive and regressive events and a highstand. Pelletization processes might have influenced cyst abundance on the sea floor, especially during periods with oligotrophic surface waters.",,

However, a discontinuity has been shown to exist in the shape of laminated strata including the late Messinian brackish/lacustrine ""Lago Mare"" biofacies. More recently, Benson and Rakic-El Bled (1991) concluded that the section is still one of the best biostratigraphic successions for the western Mediterranean in which to document terminal Miocene events, but that it entirely has an early hnessinian age (i.e. it antedates deposition of the main evaporites). This paper presents strontium isotope ages indicating that the ""classic"" threefold division in an earlier marine Messinian, a ""Lago Mare"", and a Pliocene interval (sensu Geerlings et al., 1980; Cita et al., 1980) should be maintained. Moreover, the Sr isotopic composition of the euryhaline Cyprideis ostracodes from the ""Lago Mare"" laminites is similar to those from central Mediterranean basins. This stresses the importance of late Messinian water exchange between the Vera Basin and the then enclosed Mediterranean. It thus refutes the opinion of Benson and Rakic-EI Bied (1991) that this interval is a local facies, of no particular stratigraphic importance. A time gap of up to similar to 0.8 Ma between the youngest marine strata of the Messinian and the overlying Pliocene provides a maximum timing for the duration of the Messinian salinity crisis during which very little net sedimentation occurred, compared to coeval deposits in, for example, the nearby Nijar and Sorbas basins. In the Cuevas section an inconspicuous, and hitherto overlooked, erosional gap has been observed. This separates the ""Lago Mare"" marls from the Pliocene marls. More field observations have been made and are discussed in the light of existing interpretations, in order to demonstrate the importance of more widespread erosion in the Vera Basin. Gypsum-containing mass-flow deposits, filling up a late Messinian palaeorelief in the Garrucha area, are shown to be derived from the basin. These probably continue offshore as feeder channels related to a late Messinian sea-level fall. A holistic approach of a key section, thereby not overlooking the regional geology, is a necessary step to be made before far-reaching claims can be made about its interregional significance.",,

6229723b5aee126c0f739e69,Estimation of recession curve of karst spring hydrograph: example of the spring Gradole,,"[{'name': 'Vesna Denić-Jukić'}, {'name': 'Kristina Kuštera'}, {'name': 'Damir Jukić'}]","The spring Gradole represents a typical karst spring of the rising type, which is situated in central part of Istria (Croatia). The drainage area is composed mostly of carbonate rocks (limestone) and partly of flysch components (marls and sandstones). The average altitude of the catchment area is approximately 330 m a.s.l. Strong tectonic deformations have made carbonate deposits very permeable, enabling the infiltration of water. The average rainfall is between 1046 and 1120 mm. The catchment area of the spring is estimated to approximately 114 km2. Several studies have shown that the recession curves of karst spring hydrographs characterize the storage properties of karst aquifers. The change in slope can be explained with the drainage of different types of media typical for karst, such as conduits, fractures, pores and fissures. The main factors that affect the recession curve are aquifer lithology and geometry of conduits. Consequently, the recession curve analyzes can provide information about the aquifer and the main features of karst rock massif. Usually, the recession curves can be fitted well by the function that consists of two or more exponential terms with exponential coefficients 1, 2, . . . , where the lower coefficient 1 represents the slow flow through porous medium or base flow. The recession curve that represents base flow is usually named as the master recession curve and its exponential coefficient 1 is named as the master recession coefficient. In this study, classical methods for estimation of recession curve are applied to the hydrograph of the spring Gradole. The results are compared with those obtained by applying Composite Transfer Functions (CTF). Differently from classical parametric and nonparametric transfer functions that represent the quick flow and base flow component of spring response by a single function, CTF represents the spring response by two functions adapted for the quick flow and the slow flow component. The quick flow component is represented by a nonparametric transfer function, whereas the slow flow component is represented by a parametric transfer function which is an Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH) formulated and defined mathematically from a conceptual model. By using CTF for Rainfall-Runoff (RR) modeling, the simulations of long recession periods as well as the simulations of complete hydrograph become more successful. If IUH defined from the conceptual model of linear reservoir is applied, the parametric transfer function representing slow flow component has exponential form. It means that the recession coefficient of IUH represents the master recession coefficient of the spring hydrograph, i.e. the recession coefficient of IUH can be determined by using classical methods for the estimation of master recession coefficient, and vice versa, the problem of determination of master recession coefficient can be transformed to the problem of determination of the recession coefficient of IUH. The recession coefficient of IUH is determined simultaneously with the values of nonparametric transfer function in the optimization procedure for estimation of parameters of RR model based on CTF. The recession coefficients of IUH are obtained separately in the optimization procedures for each hydrological year during the period 1987-2002. The results show that the recession curve of the spring Gradole has not a unique form. Depending on hydrological year, the obtained nonparametric transfer functions representing quick flow component can be fitted by one or two exponential terms. The values of master recession coefficient vary between 100 and 260 days. The average value for the entire period of 15 years is 140 days. These results are similar to the results obtained by applying classical methods for estimation of master recession curve. It confirms practically that the recession coefficient of IUH can be estimated from the spring hydrograph, which can be useful for RR modeling based on CTF because the number of unknown parameters is reduced.",,

Pedogenic, nodular calcretes with a thickness from 40 to 150 centimetres, associated with alluvial-plain and overbank sediments, represent palaeosol (calcisols, aridisols) development. The massive nodules show an internal mudstone fabric, calcium carbonate concentrations from 64 to 87 % and carbon and oxygen signatures of -5.3 to -6.4 and -8.5 to -9.9 parts per thousand, respectively. It is likely that they reflect a bio-induced carbonate precipitation in an oxygenated near-surface setting, connected with the evaporation of ground water. Single, up to some decimetres thick beds of calcareous mudstones and marls are characterised by a gradual colour change from reddish-brown to grey-violet upwards, and a meshwork of desiccation cracks at the top. The sediments show calcium carbonate concentrations from 22 to 43 % and carbon and oxygen isotope values ranging from -0.6 to -0.7 parts per thousand and -7.6 to -8.8 parts per thousand, respectively. They are interpreted as deposits of relatively. small, ephemeral lakes, formed by inorganic carbonate precipitation due to the evaporation of surface water. Individual beds and regressive, shallowing-upward sequences, up to a few metres thick, formed of calcareous mudstones to sandstones, marls to calcarenites and argillaceous to sandy limestones represent the depositional products of perennial, low-relief, low-energy lakes. These sediments yield carbonate concentrations from 20 to 81 % and a stable isotope composition of -2.1 to -3.1 parts per thousand for delta(13)C and -9.5 to -10.9 parts per thousand for delta(18)O. They reflect deposition in basinal and littoral lacustrine and palustrine sub-environments, in which carbonate was formed due to inorganic, bio-induced and biotic precipitation. The different types of calcareous deposits formed under and to semi-arid climatic conditions in various sub-environments of alluvial plains and perennial lakes. Their occurrence at different stratigraphic levels within the Wood Bay Formation can be related to a gradually increasing geomorphologic maturity of the terrestrial basin. The latter was marked by a decrease of the topographic relief and a lowering of sedimentation rates. An increase in landscape stability combined with a general water-level rise led to the recurrent formation of broad lake plains in the centre of the basin.",,

In temperate climate regions, soil erosion rarely assumes excessive proportions. In the management of forest soil, the potential erosion threat drastically increases with an increase in climate aridity. Water erosion is particularly favored by parent materials of low water permeability and by soils derived from such materials. In the Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean area of Croatia, these are primarily flysch, marl and Werfen schists. These materials show good physical weathering properties, thus providing a rich source of erosion material. As a rule, the soil formed from such parent material is of silty-clayey to clayey texture, and has a relatively low infiltration capacity. The soil unprotected by vegetation (burned sites) manifests particularly devastating forms of water-induced erosion. In the past 50 years, flysch terrains of Istria have been subjected to a series of technical, biological and biological-technical treatments aimed at preventing water erosion and recovering the eroded soils. An experimental (research) site was set up in Abrami near Buzet for the purpose of monitoring erosion processes and rehabilitation effects of different biological-technical and biological methods of eroded area recovery. The effects of the treatments on soil properties in the research site are in the form of progressive pedogenetic processes. A synergy of the effects of recovery methods and different natural conditions (relief, vegetation) in the experimental site is particularly well reflected in erosion indicators, such as the production of erosion sediment (erosion production), and to a lesser extent, the surface flow index. For this reason, research in this work focuses primarily on soil properties and erosion production dynamics. From the geological-lithological aspect, the research site of Abrami is made up of Eocene flysch composed of alternate layers of light grey marl and dark lime sandstone, i.e. thinner or thicker interbeds of sandy limestone. The climate is sub-Mediterranean. The mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is 975 mm. The natural potential vegetation in the localities is represented by the community of hop hornbeam and autumn moor grass. Established in 1956 on the slope exposed to highly pronounced erosion processes, the research site has an area of 23.46 ha. A series of technical and biological erosion recovery measures had been undertaken in the site by 1963 for the purpose of investigating their applicability in practice. Technical activities included the construction of step-like terraces, of the bench terrace type (""gradoni""), and contour rustic walls. A variety of plant material was planted and seeds of different plant species were sown in the area (Table 1). Several control plots were also established in parts of the Abrami site, where either no treatment was applied or the seedlings were planted into the planting holes. Six plots intended for the measurement of erosion sediment production were established in 1969, followed by research into the quantitative erosion indicators, which started in 1970 (Table 1). After an interruption in 1977, measurements were resumed in 1997 and 1998 (two plots) and in 1999 (three plots). Erosion indicators have continuously been measured since 2000; however, measurements in plot I (plot I was omitted from this research due to its specific features) have been performed by means of terrestrial photogrammetry. The seventh plot was established in 2004, and has been the subject of measurements since 2005. This work encompasses measurement data from 2005, 2006 and 2007. The research includes plots II, III, IV, V. as well as VI and VII. The soil and organic residues were sampled in the immediate surroundings of the erosion-measuring plots. Next to the plots in which no technical recovery measures were undertaken, a pedological profile was opened and the soil was sampled by horizons. Some smaller plots of 50 x 50 cm were used to sample the forest floor in 3 points next to the plots (near the top, in the middle of the slope and near the bottom). Undisturbed soil from the depth of 0-5 cm was cylinder-sampled in these smaller plots. The soil profiles next to the terraced plots were not sampled. The forest floor was sampled in small 50 x 50 cm plots, particularly those established on the slopes and on the top of the bench terraces. After the removal of the forest floor, the soil in the small plots was sampled with a probe (disturbed soil) to a 10 cm depth, and with a cylinder (undisturbed soil) to a 5 cm depth. The granulometric soil composition was determined according to HRN ISO 11277:2004, the pH according to HRN ISO 10390:2005, the CaCO(3) content according to HRN 150 10693:2004, organic carbon (TOC) according to HRN ISO 10694:2004, porosity according to HR ISO 11508 and 11272 2004, water retention capacity according to HRN ISO 11461:2001, air capacity according to HRN ISO 11580 and 11272:2004, and soil water permeability according to HRN ISO 17312:2005. Measurements of erosion parameters were based on the cumulative measurement of runoff and erosion sediment for each particular rain event (in some cases several rain events were measured cumulatively). Water with eroded particles was determined in the field by measuring water levels in retention basins and/or tubs. The total quantity of erosion sediment in the collected water was determined according to the URN ISO 4365 standard. Rain events were registered in the site itself with a pluviograph within the meteorological station of Abrami. In converting the erosion production mass into volume, the average erosion sediment density was assumed to be 1.2 Mg m(-3). Statistical analyses (descriptive statistics, correlations, t-test) were performed with STATISTICA 7.1 software. Research into soil physiography in the site did not show any significant differences between the samples, regardless of sampling depths (the pH in water suspension is between 7.7 and 7.9), which indicates long-term erosion impacts, that is, the homogeneity of the material. The soil in plot II does not have a developed humus-accumulative horizon. It is a strongly skeletal eutric regosol with a discontinued layer of the forest floor (the layer contains 1,531 kg ha(-1) of dry organic matter). The soil in the surface 0.5 cm is moderately porous (48.4%), with moderate water capacity (37%) and low water permeability (Table 2). In plots II and III (one immediately next to the other) the soil is eutric cambisol, with a depth of similar to 90 cm. The depth of the humus-accumulative horizon is only 2 - 4 cm, which reflects the erosion impact in the past. The slightly-to-moderately porous soil has relatively low water permeability (Table 2). In plot V the soil is eroded eutric cambisol with a discontinued A-horizon. This is shallower and texturally lighter soil than the soil in plots III and VII. In terms of granulometric composition, the soil is silty loam. Water permeability is very fast in the surface 5 cm. In plots IV and VI, the soil in the surface 10 cm is of silty-clayey texture, both on the slopes and the terraces. On the terraces of these plots the soil is more compacted and the forest floor accumulation is higher, but water permeability is lower than on the slopes of the bench terraces. The annual precipitation amount ranged from 908 mm in 2005, over 979 mm in 2006, to 1.167 mm in 2007. During 2005, the least precipitation occurred in the first annual quarter (< 100 mm), while in the other 3 quarters the amount of precipitation was very similar. During 2006 and 2007, precipitation amounts by quarters were almost identical: most rainfall occurred in the 1(st), followed by the 3(rd) quarter, and the least occurred in the 4(th) quarter (Fig. 5). Measurements of surface runoff and erosion production show that the most severe erosion occurred in plot II (Fig. 5). In the early 1970s, the annual erosion production in this plot amounted to over 500 m(3) km(-2), while during the three-year measurement period it came to between 47.9 and 65.3 m(3) km(-2). More than half of the erosion production took place in the 3(rd) annual quarter. Of other plots, distinct production is manifested by plot V and plot VII (Fig. 5 and 6). In the three remaining plots, the annual erosion production is considerably lower and does not exceed 0.5 m(3) km(-2). There is no significant difference in the dynamics of annual production, except that erosion extremes occurred in plot IV in 2007, which coincides with the extremes in plots II and V. The lowest surface runoff coefficient was identified in plot III and the highest in plot II. The mean annual runoff coefficient in plot II ranges between 0.052 and 0.076, and the maximal comes to as much as 0.397. This suggests a very low infiltration capacity of precipitation water. Namely, in this plot the soil is shallow regosol of silty texture (72% of silt) and of very poor water permeability capacity (k=0.04 m/day). Erosion production in plots IV and VI is very low (Fig. 5). Overall biomass production in plot VI is lower than in plot IV, while the quantity of forest floor is similar to that in plot II. On the other hand, better developed trees of black pine and a very dense layer of ground vegetation in plot IV are responsible for higher leaf litter quantities: 3,312 kg ha(-1) on the slopes of the bench terraces and 4,144 kg ha(-1) on the terraces. It was found that erosion production was lower in the plots with higher organic matter content (in the forest floor and the mineral part of the soil). All these point to a series of mutual impacts, which synergistically determine the rate and intensity of erosion in these plots. This is explained by lower erosion sediment production in Plot IV in comparison with plots V and VI, although the terrain in plot IV has a much steeper slope. On the other hand, it is evident that, compared to plot V in which only biological recovery measures were applied, the application of technical recovery measures in plots IV and VI resulted in a much earlier reduction of erosion intensities. According to the results of research, the application of biological-technical recovery measures increases soil permeability and the soil organic matter content in proportion to the steepness of the terrain. The steeper the terrain, the higher the content is. In this climatic region, the most erodible period occurs in the 3(rd) quarter of the year. Erosion production in the terrain recovered with biological-technical measures is very low, regardless of the distribution and intensity of precipitation; on the other hand, biological recovery itself, without any technical measures, results in much weaker erosion control.",,

Giusberti'}, {'name': 'F. Boscolo Galazzo'}, {'name': 'E. Thomas'}]","Abstract. The Forada section (northeastern Italy) provides a continuous, expanded deep-sea record of the Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) in the central-western Tethys. We combine a new, high resolution, benthic foraminiferal assemblage record with published calcareous plankton, mineralogical and biomarker data to document climatic and environmental changes across the PETM, highlighting the benthic foraminiferal extinction event (BEE). The onset of the PETM, occurring ~ 30 kyr after a precursor event, is marked by a thin, black, barren clay layer, possibly representing a brief pulse of anoxia and carbonate dissolution. The BEE occurred within the 10 cm interval including this layer. During the first 3.5 kyr of the PETM several agglutinated recolonizing taxa show rapid species turnover, indicating a highly unstable, CaCO3-corrosive environment. Calcareous taxa reappeared after this interval, and the next ~ 9 kyr were characterized by rapid alternation of peaks in abundance of various calcareous and agglutinant recolonizers. These observations suggest that synergistic stressors including deep water CaCO3-corrosiveness, low oxygenation, and high environmental instability caused the extinction. Combined faunal and biomarker data (BIT index, higher plant n-alkane average chain length) and the high abundance of the mineral chlorite suggest that erosion and weathering increased strongly at the onset of the PETM, due to an overall wet climate with invigorated hydrological cycle, which led to storm flood-events carrying massive sediment discharge into the Belluno Basin. This interval was followed by the core of the PETM, characterized by four precessionally paced cycles in CaCO3%, hematite%, δ13C, abundant occurrence of opportunistic benthic foraminiferal taxa, as well as calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminiferal taxa typical of high productivity environments, radiolarians, and lower δDn-alkanes. We interpret these cycles as reflecting alternation between an overall arid climate, characterized by strong winds and intense upwelling, with an overall humid climate, with abundant rains and high sediment delivery (including refractory organic carbon) from land. Precessionally paced marl-limestone couplets occur throughout the recovery interval of the CIE and up to ten meters above it, suggesting that these wet-dry cycles persisted, though at declining intensity, after the peak PETM. Enhanced climate extremes at mid-latitudes might have been a direct response to the massive CO2 input in the ocean atmosphere system at the Paleocene–Eocene transition, and may have had a primary role in restoring the Earth system to steady state.",,

The samples from four different outcrops were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and by scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with special emphasis on clay-mineral characterization (e.g. illitic phases). The analysed samples have simple mineral assemblages and consist of detrital quartz, albite and calcite, scarce clay matrix (mainly illite with chlorite), and calcite and dolomite cement. The lack of other phyllosilicates such as mixed-layer illite-smectite (I-S), pyrophyllite, Na-micas, or kaolin minerals is quite remarkable. On the SEM scale, samples (with marl composition) have poorly sorted textures and high detrital contents. In many cases they show bedding and/or cleavage, and in some cases neither is observed. Most of the clay-sized illites show very similar crystallinity and b(0) values (determined by XRD) and distributions of crystallite thickness (measured by TEM) in all the outcrops, which is typical of late-diagenesis illites forming under low-pressure conditions. These illites are parallel (or subparallel) to bedding or randomly orientated. They are also characterized by disordered polytypes and low K contents. In some TEM images, a second type of illite has been observed. This secondary illite occurs parallel to cleavage, with thicker crystals (25-35 layers), K contents in the interlayer, and a 2M(1) polytype.

 abundance in radioactive elements, mainly uranium, in a way so far not found elsewhere on the Arabian Peninsula. Uranium (U)
 and thorium in Jordan are concentrated in eight different types of ore mineralization: (1) intrusive-related (intramagmatic),
 (2) vein-type, (3) superficial, (4) sandstone-hosted (5) limestone-hosted, (6) U-Th-REE placer-type, (7) black shales, and
 (8) phosphorites. The major concentration of radioactive elements are synsedimentary and diagenetic in nature, mainly in near-shore
 marine depositional environments where uranium contents are abnormally high in the late Cretaceous to Paleogene phosphorites
 and increasing towards the mobile shelf of the Tethys ocean. These uraniferous phosphorites form the source of uranium that
 was redeposited within terrigenous chemical residues of lacustrine-fluvial depositional systems in Central Jordan (calcretes).
 Faultbound radiometric anomalies are caused by hot brines being vented along with the Jordan-Dead-Sea rifting. Presumably,
 low-grade U accumulation in (hot) black shales and marls of Silurian age are responsible for these radiometric anomalies.
 In the present paper, the Jordanian uranium concentrations are compared with reference types of uranium deposits elsewhere
 in the world to get an idea if the geological, chemical, and mineralogical features of analogue uranium mineralization in
 Jordan are indicative of economic targets. The uranium concentration in Jordanian phosphorites has been tracked beyond the
 border into Syria, Iraq, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. The uranium potential in neighboring countries is assessed based on the
 current geological data available for the Mediterranean Phosphorite Belt which is poised to become a another string to the
 bow with respect to energy supply on the Arabian Peninsula.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/E4/1F/CC/E41FCC321C3D6404DBBE1895C1ED44E8.pdf

The bedrock geology is typified by a thick limestone overlain by a sequence of marine marl and a Quaternary moraine of variable thickness and composition. The limestone is the largest aquifer within the area and is used to supply water for Nyborg. The upper 100 in or so of the limestone generally contain fresh water and below that the groundwater is saline.

Soils are capable of preserving the signs of all the natural and humaninduced activities that ever affected them. Via the identification and understanding of these signs it is possible to reconstruct ancient environments and obtain an insight into the lives of ancient societies. This has been successfully proven in numerous studies in Hungary (e.g. BARCZI et al., 2009; KRAUSZ, 2014; PETŐ, et al. 2015). This paper aims at furthering the understanding and reconstruction of the history of the Százhalombatta-Földvár tell site by analysing soil science data. Tell sites are very complex, so parallel to traditional archaeological investigation, a range of natural sciences (e.g. plant, animal and geological sciences) are involved in their analysis. In this study, soil science techniques, namely soil analysis and thinsection soil micromorphological analysis were employed to gain an insight into the past 4 000 years of the settlement’s history. The intensity and the variability of human activities are also investigated. The results revealed very intensive human influence and significant environmental changes in Százhalombatta-Földvár, demonstrating the importance of the area. Historical , regional and geological setting The Bronze Age tell settlement in Százhalombatta-Földvár is situated on a high plateau some 30 km south of Budapest, alongside the Danube. A tell is a series of layers of human-related materials, e.g. house remains, middens, rubble, tools, personal goods, jewels, etc., that create an artificial mound in the course of time. The first occupation of the site can be dated back to the Early Bronze Age (c. 2500 BC) and the presence of humans can be traced archaeologically until the Roman period (c. 200 AD). In the light of the archaeological evidence a highly diverse inhabitation of the area can be pictured. In 2000 BC (Early Bronze Age) the settlement was limited to groups of houses and farm buildings rather than being a village. 422 F Ü L E K Y e t a l . Around 1800 BC, as a consequence of population growth, the number of houses increased, resulting in the formation of a small village. By 1500 BC the village developed into an “urban-like” settlement due to a further phase of population growth and enlargement. By 1200 BC (end of the Middle Bronze Age) life on the tell came to an end. This phenomenon was characteristic not only of Százhalombatta-Földvár, but of tells throughout Hungary. The reason for this is still a mystery and remains one of the most fascinating archaeological questions facing tell researchers. The site was only re-settled some 200–300 years later during the Late Bronze Age (c. 1000 BC). The initial phase of the Late Bronze/Early Iron Age rampart (retaining wall) was built around 800 BC. The burial mounds, after which Százhalombatta was named (Százhalombatta means “hundred burrows”), are also the remnants of this period. Due to the lack of research there is not much data on the settlement’s Roman history, but the remains of a watchtower clearly indicate the Roman presence (POROSZLAI, 2000; VICZE, 2005; KOVÁCS et al., 2011). The research area is part of the Mezőföld region (Transdanubia) where high quality clay deposits several metres thick were formed during the Middle Pliocene as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the Pannonian Sea. At that time, intensive tectonic movements were responsible for surface formation. Driven by this massive force, the seabed started to rise but not at an equal rate. The eastern part rose to a higher level than the southern part, resulting in a slight north-west – south-east slope (PÉCSI, 1967). At the same time the whole plate began to break up, which created a chessboard-like surface. Along the breaklines certain areas started to sink while others evolved, forming elevations, like the area under investigation, on which human occupation later took place. The elevations were further shaped by erosion and sediment accumulated on the lower-lying areas. Due to the more humid conditions in the Pleistocene, fluvial erosion played the most important role in altering the surface. As a result, complex valley systems started to cut through the landscape. Ice Age loess deposition was the next major process, which created the basis for later soil development (FRISNYÁK et al., 1977) and appropriate conditions for human life. The area under investigation is bordered by the Danube to the East, a former erosion gully to the North and an old quarry face to the South (Fig. 1). The settlement could only be entered from the South, as is also true today. The present dimensions of the tell are about 160 m in length and 40–60 m in width, which is only one fifth of its original extension. The rest of the site was destroyed as a consequence of clay mining for the nearby brick factory. The depth of the cultural layer varies between 2 to 6 m, with an average of 4 m (VARGA, 2000). Originally the Danube flowed about 300 m away from its present bed and the once gently sloping banks became much steeper over time. To the South lies the valley of the Benta stream, where the above-mentioned brick factory was built during the 1870s to exploit the clay deposits. The quarry face is the reminder of the brick/making, which was discontinued in the 1990s. The present quarry side of the settlement has a very steep slope with overhanging cliffs and piles of rubble at the bottom. Investigation of a Bronze Age tell using soil analysis data 423 Fig. 1 Aerial view of Százhalombatta-Földvár archaeological site This side also reveals the Pannonian layers and the quarternary and recent sediments in the area. Earlier research on the clay quarry (KOÓS, 1975) revealed a 35 m thick series of layers containing clayey rock powder (loamy) and sandy layers. The clayey rock powder that dominates in the layers is suitable for ceramic making and was used both by ancient people and the modern brick factory.

This big fold shows internal N130 degrees, N95 degrees and N20 degrees minor folds. This structure indicates that the TTR area was formed in the hinge between the Anti-Atlas and the Ougarta belts. A number of these folds are the consequence of the underlying Precambrian faults reactivation and alternation of competent and incompetent levels.

Geology and characteristics of Messinian salt deposits and methods of their mining were studied in the underground salt mine at Realmonte near Agrigento, exploiting (shaft - Fig. 7 - and galleries system is 70 km long to the depth of 600 m, explosive method, chambers up to 7.5 m high) the Realmonte salt deposit located in SE part of evaporate Caltanissetta basin (Fig. 3-4). the Exploited rock salt seam is 400-600 m thick, inclined and locally deformed, with 100 m thick complex of K-Mg salts, composed of 6 kainite-polyhalite seams up to 18 m thick interbedded with rock salt (Fig. 5-6). Salt rock is rhythmically laminated with anhydrite and clay (Fig. 8-12), it contains 98.5-99% NaCl and up to 1,5% insolubles (clay, anhydrite, polyhalite). Annual production of Realmonte mine is ca. 500 x 10(3) Mg with up to 60 persons employed. The overlain clay-sulphate-marl deposits of Messinian and marly clays of Late Pliocene (Trubi Fm), with numerous sedimentary structures (e.g. laminated sulphates of ,,balatino"" type, ""grass"" and cone selenitic gypsum and rippled gypsum arenites) and microfauna were perfectly exposed for study on the cliff wall nearby the Capo Rossello (Fig. 13-19).

The «Calcari a Briozoi e Litotamni» Formation represents the Cenozoic portion of the Latium-Abruzzi carbonate platform, that paraconformably overlies the Cretaceous platform limestones. The Miocene limestones consist predominantly of biogenic elements belonging to rhodalgal/molechfor associations (CARANNANTE et alii, 1988) deposited on a low-angle carbonate ramp (BRANDANO, 2001). They are overlain by hemipelagic marls rich in planktonic foraminifers (Tortonian Orbolina Marls). In the Tagliacozzo area (Carseolani Mountains) the «Calcari a Briozoi e Litotamni» formation can be subdivided into three main lithostratigraphic units. The lowest unit (UL1) consists of 1 to 2 m thick beds composed of fine bioclastic wackestone and packstone unconformably overlying the Upper Cretaceous carbonate platform deposits. Its thickness is about 10 m. The second unit (UL2),up to 90 m thick, is made up of poorly stratified, white coarse-grained echinoid-foraminifer packstone and pectinid-bryozoan floatstone; the third unit (UL3) is composed of 8 meters of finely stratified, with planar bedding planes, fine to medium-grained echinoid-planktonic foraminiferal packstone. A «mineralized» hardground marks the boundary between UL3 and «Orbulina marls». The analysed rhodoliths occur in the middle part of UL2, forming a thick 0.6 m level. The rhodoliths have mainly spheroidal shape, a diameter of 4-5 cm and a laminar structure. The rare elliptical rhodoliths show major axis measuring 8-9 cm and minor axis measuring 5-6 cm. These last rhodoliths show an internal laminar structure with tendency to be columnar towards the exterior. The nucleus is generally made up of bryozoan colonies. Borings (Entobia) on bivalve shells and red-algal thalli are also visible. Bryozoans, echinoid fragments, bivalves, benthic and plancktonic foraminifera form the fossil skeletal fraction. This study provides some new paleoecological data about the «Calcari a Briozoi e Litotamni» Formation. The algal association is mainly dominated by Lithothamnion (50%) and secondarily by Mesophyllum (30%) and Sporolithon (20%). The coralline algae association clearly indicates a circalittoral environment. The laminar structure of the rhodoliths is related to the high energy conditions at the bottom (BOSENCE, 1983). The presence of bioerosion indicates low rates of sedimentation. The occurrence of Sporolithon in the red algae associations and the palaeoclimate reconstruction in Early Miocene times (VANNUCCI et alii, 1996; ESTEBAN, 1996; POMAR et alii, 2001) suggest that deposition took place in the Miocene under subtropical-tropical climatic conditions.",,

These rivers were classified as antecedent (10), multistory (17), re-established (5) and juvenile (9) drainage types. Antecedent drainage is when a river has maintained its original direction of flow across later tectonic topography. Multistory drainage consists of a re-established drainage and of a reverse drainage. Reverse drainage, when flow direction along part of a river is reversed, consists of two opposing drainage components: a misfit and a reverse element; the area between these two elements, termed “wind gap”, is a dry valley. Re-established drainage is when a reverse element returns to its original flow direction. Juvenile drainage consists of small incising and headward-eroding streams. The sediments that the rivers flow across (soft uncohesive marls or coarse-grained deposits and Pre-Neogene basement with limestones), river power (strong close to the source or weak far from the source), presence or absence of transfer faults and tilted blocks due to the activity of synthetic and antithetic faults, all influence whether an antecedent drainage will remain unchanged or will be changed to a reverse drainage. When transfer faults cross-cut the area of a wind gap and the underlying sediments were soft uncohesive marls, reverse drainage changed to a re-established drainage. In other cases, where transfer faults were absent and underlying deposits were coarse-grained sediments or limestones, in the area of the wind gap, then reverse drainage remained unchanged.",,

Secondly, the clinker is ground with calcium sulphates and with industrial processes wastes such as blast furnace slag, limestone, natural pozzolana and industrial pozzolanic materials, e.g. fly ash, silica fume and burnt shale. 90-150 kWh/t cement are used in the process. Two basic types of clinker production processes exist, depending on the way the row materials are prepared before entering the kiln system: in the wet method, water is added to form a wet thick slurry whereas the dry process is based on drying the bulk materials to form a dry powdered meal. The choice of process depends on moisture content of the available raw material. When wet raw materials (moisture content over 20%) are available, the wet process can be preferred. However, in Europe, today's new cement plants are all based on the dry process as the wet process requires approximately 56 to 66% more energy. For dry processes, current state-of-the-art technologies are kiln systems with multistage cyclone preheaters and precalciner. Capacities of up to 15,000 tonnes clinker per day are achievable and unit consumption as low as 3.3 GJ/t clinker. [IEA, 3] building a new plant with a capacity of 1 million tonnes/annum of cement using the conventional dry processes with 5-stage preheater and precalciner costs €263 per tonne/annum (€ 2010). The investment cost increases to some €558/t if CO 2 emissions produced in the process are captured (and stored) using post-combustion technologies and to €327/t using oxy-combustion technologies. According to the European Cement Research Academy [ECRA, 2] new plants with capacities of 2, 1 and 0.5 million tonnes per year, using state-of-the-art technologies the unit investment costs is €130, €170 and €250 per tonne/annum respectively (€ 2007). Operation and maintenance (O&M) costs (including labour, power and fuel costs, but no deprecation) amount to €29/t for new, state-of-the-art plants and to €32/t for a typical existing plant with no CO2 capture. O&M costs are estimated to rise to €66 and €45/t for plants equipped with post-combustion …",,

The new understandings on the control of paleo-uplift over facies, reservoirs and accumulations are reached: (1) During the sedimentary period of Majiagou Formation, the central paleo-uplift divided the North China Sea in central-eastern of the basin from the Qinqi Sea at southwest margin of the basin, and controlled the deposition of the thick hummocky grain beach facies dolomite on platform margin of Ma 4 Member. Under the influence of the evolution of the central paleo-uplift, the frame of two uplifts alternate with two sags was formed in the central-eastern part of the basin, dolomite of inner-platform beach facies developed in the underwater low-uplift zones, and marl developed in the low-lying areas between uplifts. (2) From the central paleo-uplift to the east margin of the basin, the dolomite in the Ma 4 Member gradually becomes thinner and turns into limestone. The lateral sealing of the limestone sedimentary facies transition zone gives rise to a large dolomite lithological trap. (3) During the late Caledonian, the basin was uplifted as a whole, and the central paleo-uplift was exposed and denuded to various degrees; high-quality Upper Paleozoic Carboniferous—Permian coal measures source rocks deposited on the paleo-uplift in an area of 60 000 km2 providing large-scale hydrocarbon for the dolomite lithological traps in the underlying Ma 4 Member. (4) During the Indosinian—Yanshanian stage, the basin tilted westwards, and central paleo-uplift depressed into an efficient hydrocarbon supply window. The gas from the Upper Paleozoic source rock migrated through the high porosity and permeability dolomite in the central paleo-uplift to and accumulated in the updip high part; meanwhile, the subsalt marine source rock supplied gas through the Caledonian faults and micro-fractures as a significant supplementary. Under the guidance of the above new understandings, two favorable exploration areas in the Ma 4 Member in the central-eastern basin were sorted out. Two risk exploration wells were deployed, both revealed thick gas-bearing layer in Ma 4 Member, and one of them tapped high production gas flow. The study has brought a historic breakthrough in the gas exploration of subsalt Ma 4 Member of Ordovician, and opened up a new frontier of gas exploration in the Ordos Basin.",,

These members display alternating limestone-marl lithotypes and represent shallow marine palaeoenvironments. The lower carbonate member is interpreted as a proximal palaeoenvironment (palaeobathymetry = 5 to 10 m), where storm and swell deposits were prevalent and the salinity was occasionally weak. The relative richness of brown phytoclasts in this part is favoured by good preservation related to restricted conditions, These conditions would explain the dominance of the nannofossil Cyclagelosphaera margerelii in the nannofossil assemblages. The palynological data as those of the nannofossil assemblages show variations in the shift from carbonate member to marly member. The dominance of brown phytoclasts over black phytoclasts, the presence of amorphous organic matter (AOM), and the highest abundance and diversity observed within the nannofossil assemblages suggest that the maximum of distality occurred during this transition, at the basal part of the Marries a Exogyres superieures. The upper part of the section (marly member) characterized by storm deposits and storm-coquina beds is deeper (palaeobathymetry probably between 10 and 40 m depth) than the lower part. Oxidizing depositional conditions prevailed and explained the abundance of black particles found in this upper part. while proximate cysts and elevated non-placolith coccolith abundances indicate that relationships with the open sea were probably more significant compared to the lower part. Towards the top of the section, recurrences of restricted conditions are reflected by relatively elevated amounts of AOM and the abundance peak of the nannofossil Biscutum ellipticum. This study shows that micropalaeontological signals can be well recorded in vast lagunal domains. We speculate that salinity, nutrient supply, and oxygenation of the waters control microfossil associations. In shallow environments, these parameters are particularly fluctuating, especially when freshwater dilutes marine waters in surface, on the occasion of rainy periods or of intense arrival of continental waters.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/8D/73/FA/8D73FA78712F34A90AE7736D062C3FCC.pdf

On short temporal scales the hydrological system that allows for the generation of critical pore pressures or soil moisture conditions on the potential shear surface determines the occurrence of these landslides. Hence the relative contribution of landsliding to land degradation processes can be quantified in terms of its magnitude and frequency through a semiphysical hillslope model that links the relevant hydrological processes to a stability analysis. For the development of such a combined model for hydrology and slope stability a conceptualization of the process system is needed. Through the implementation of the resulting model in a GIS environment the effect of topography, to which the occurrence of landslides is intrinsically linked, can be incorporated. In addition, the spatial variation of hydrological and geomechanical parameters can be incorporated in the model. This is important since the occurrence and extent of shallow landslides is directly dependent on the net rainfall input in the hydrological system, as defined by the land cover of the area.
 In this paper a conceptual model is presented that combines a description of the hydrology with an assessment of the slope stability. The conceptual framework of this model is based on field observations in the Alcoy area (SE Spain). In this area shallow landslides occur on steep, unsaturated slopes in marly deposits of Miocene age, at the boundary between regolith and bedrock (1–2 m depth). Given the low matric permeability of the marl it has been assumed that preferential flow along distinct sets of fissures by-passing slower matric percolation might account for the observed response time of landslides to rainfall events. The fissures in the regolith are either relict primary bedrock structures (discontinuities) or are formed by weathering, creep and shear; they are supplied with water by subsurface flow through the more permeable rootzone. With the combined slope stability model, which is programmed in the meta-language embedded in the PCRaster GIS package, a sensitivity analysis has been performed to assess the impact of fissure flow on the occurrence of landslides in a small catchment of 1.2 km2 near Alcoy.

Our study is based on the archaeological area of Selinunte in which we have noticed a process of erosion in progress. In this area we have considered a particular portion of the coast, around 8 km long, since our purpose is the individuation of anthropic elements such as ports, and natural elements, such as rivers. In this area we have set some point of reference using historical and recent cartography in a 1:25.000 scale dating back to 1971, a regional technical paper in a 1: 10.000 scale from 1994, and aerial pictures from 2000 and 2008, all of which we have geo-related starting from previous geo-related papers, locating some Ground Control Points apparent in all of the considered papers. We have used GIS support and the software program ARCVIEW. We have done a comparison between the actual shoreline and its trend in the previous years. In fact, we have measured the distance between the points considered stable on the shoreline that are changing all the time. In this way we have noticed the course of the coastline, appraising its advancement or withdrawal. The obtained data show that considering 24 stable points, in 70% of cases there has been coast withdrawal between 1994 and 2000; in 60% there has been erosion between 2000 and 2008. From an administrative point of view, the studied area includes the territory of Castelvetrano (TP) and involves a coastline extending to around 8 km, from the beach of Triscina-Selinunte, a fraction of Castelvetrano, to east of the mouth of River Belice. This extension has been defined as thoroughly as possible, in order to include River Belice, which is east of the archaeological park. The two analyzed rivers are Belice and Modione, both belonging to the hydrographic basin River Modione and in the area between River Modione and River Belice. From the geo-morphological point of view two typologies of prevailing landscapes can be considered: a hilly one in the basin, in the most northern area and another one, characterizing the coastal band. The nature of the ground is predominantly clay or clayey-marl with sand breakthroughs covered by calcarenites. In this area some marine terraces are present, for example the marine terrace beneath the Acropolis of Selinunte, situated at +50 m u.s.l. Another helpful element for the study of coast erosion is the discovery of an ancient port in around 1951, now buried under the sand.",,

 and marls constitute an Upper Cretaceous shelf succession approximately 100 meters thick. The succession is part of the mixed
 siliciclasticcarbonate Gosau Group that was deposited at the northern margin of the Austroalpine microplate.
 
 In its lower part, the carbonate succession at Haidach comprises two stratal packages that each consists, from bottom to top,
 of a coral-rudist mound capped by a rudist biostrome which, in turn, is overlain by bioclastic limestones and, locally, marls.
 The coral-rudist mounds consist mainly of floatstones. The coral assemblage is dominated by Fungiina, Astreoina, Heterocoeniina
 andAgathelia asperella (stylinina). From the rudists, elevators (Vaccinites spp., radiolitids) and recumbents (Plagioptychus) are present. Calcareous sponges, sclerosponges, and octocorals are subordinate. The elevator rudists commonly are small;
 they settled on branched corals, coral heads, on rudists, and on biolastic debris. The rudists, in turn, provided settlement
 sites for corals. Predominantly plocoid and thamnasteroid coral growth forms indicate soft substrata and high sedimentation
 rates. The mounds were episodically smothered by carbonate mud. Many corals and rudists are coated by thick and diverse encrustations
 that indicate high nutrient level and/or turbid waters.
 
 
 
 The coral-rudist mounds are capped byVaccinites biostromes up to 5 m thick. The establishment of these biostromes may result from unfavourable environmental conditions for
 corals, coupled with the potential of the elevator rudists for effective substrate colonization. TheVaccinites biostromes are locally topped by a thin radiolitid biostrome. The biostromes, in turn, are overlain by bioclastic limestones;
 these are arranged in stratal packages that were deposited from carbonate sand bodies. Approximately midsection, an interval
 of marls with abundantPhelopteria is present. These marls were deposited in a quiet lagoonal area where meadows of sea grass or algae, coupled with an elevated
 nutrient level, triggered the mass occurrence ofPhelopteria.
 
 
 
 The upper part of the Haidach section consists of stratal packages that each is composed of a rudist biostrome overlain by
 bioclastic wackestones to packstones with diverse smaller benthic foraminifera and calcareous green algae. The biostromes
 are either built by radiolitids,Vaccinites, andPleurocora, or consist exclusively of radiolitids (mainlyRadiolites). Both the biostromes and the bioclastic limestones were deposited in a low-energy lagoonal environment that was punctuated
 by high-energy events.In situ-rudist fabrics typically have a matrix of mudstone to rudistclastic wackestone; other biogens (incl. smaller benthic foraminifera)
 are absent or very rare. The matrix of rudist fabrics that indicate episodic destruction by high-energy events contain a fossil
 assemblage similar to the vertically associated bioclastic limestones. Substrata colonized by rudists thus were unfavourable
 at least for smaller benthic foraminifera.
 
 
 
 The described succession was deposited on a gently inclined shelf segment, where coral-rudist mounds and hippuritid biostromes
 were separated by a belt of bioclastic sand bodies from a lagoon with radiolitid biostromes. The mounds document that corals
 and Late Cretaceous elevator rudists may co-occur in close association. On the scale of the entire succession, however, mainly
 as a result of the wide ecologic range of the rudists relative to corals, the coral-dominated mounds and the rudist biostromes
 are vertically separated.

Generally, the clastic units are composed of claystone and sandstone with intercalation of carbonate facies (marl, clayey limestone...etc.) especially in the northern parts of Amij and Muhaiwir Formations and with ironstone especially in Hussainiyat Formation (Al-Mubarak and Amin, 1983; Jassim et al., 1984, 1986; Al-Naqib et al., 1986; Al-Sengary, 1987; Ismail, 1996; Tobia, 2005). It is evident from a recent study (Tobia, 2005) that there is a variation in the depositional environment of the northern from the southern parts of the Hussainiyat, Amij and Muhaiwir Formations, due to the variation in pH and Eh and also the more effect of the sea water on the northern part. The variation has been deduced from mineral chemistry and its assemblages. As the chemistry of the clay minerals is very sensitive to the environmental changes (from weathering and transportation to the deposition), the current study focused on the clay fractions of the clastic units of above mentioned Formations. The clastic units are composed mainly of kaolinite with illitic clays. However, the illitic clays are usually mixed layer with the illite making up to 80% of the clay layer with the smectite making the rest. Aja and Rosenberg (1992) have suggested that the illite/ smectites have four distinct compositions: K0.29/O10(OH)2 (S), K0.5/O10(OH)2 (IS), K0.69/O10(OH)2 (ISII) and K0.85/O10(OH)2 (I) with the illiterich forms being more stable at elevated temperatures. There are many difficulties for the direct evaluation of the composition of illite interstratifications, and in order to overcome these difficulties an indirect evaluation is carried out. The aim of this study, however, is to relate the K for H2O substitution, and to extrapolate the pH conditions. 3 Iraqi Journal of Earth SciencesVol. 8No 1May2008 100g of each studied sample (22 samples from 7 sections and 2 bore-holes) were grounded in a porcelain mortar. The clay fractions (<2μm) and bulk samples were analyzed for K contents using a Flame Photometer 410 of Sherwood Company. The clay fraction was separated by pipette method described by Folk (1974). The suspensions of these fractions were dried on glass slides. The clay samples in oriented mounts were run under three separate conditions: air dried, ethylene glycol treatment and heating to 550C for 1 hour. X-ray diffraction patterns of oriented aggregates were examined by Philips PW 1410 Spectrophotometer, equipped with a monochromatic CuKα radiation at 40kV and 20mA. The peaks of the clay minerals were identified, and the layer sequence of illite/ smectite interstratification was quantified by using the curves developed by Tomita and Takahashi (1985) based on intersecting d-values of illite/ smectite for 001and 002 reflections. The intersection point represents PSI (y-axis) and PIS (x-axis). PSI is probability that an illite layer succeeds smectite layer where the first layer is smectite; PIS is probability that a smectite layer succeeds an illite layer where the first layer is illite. 50 0 50 100 km studied area Rutba h 10 AS 11H S 7MM 5H N",,

Continuous resistivity profiling (CRP) and borehole data from Mersin Harbour were used to interpret geoelectric stratigraphy of Neogene-Quaternary sediments in the area. This represents one of few such detailed case studies that have applied these valuable CRP techniques for the purpose of marine stratigraphic imaging. It was found that the Neogene-Quaternary sedimentary succession in the area consists of three geoelectric units (GU1, GU2, and GU3 from base to top). The lowest unit, GU1, has a resistivity value of greater than 20.0 ohm-m and consists of Miocene aged limestone and marl. The middle unit, GU2, is characterized by resistivity values ranging from 3.0 to 20.0 ohm-m. Its thickness is greater than 90 m, with the upper section being composed of stiff clay sequences which are Plio-Pleistocene in age. The uppermost unit, GU3, has resistivity values varying from 1.0 to 3.0 ohm-m. This unit displays a maximum thickness of 15 m, and is composed of Holocene muds together with gravel, sand, silt and clay (sometimes incorporating shells) materials of the Plio-Pleistocene age and their various mixtures, silty/clay limestone, and conglomerate sandstone. Comparisons of the geoelectric units with the depositional sequences interpreted from the available seismic data outwith, but close to, Mersin Harbour reveal that the geoelectric unit GU3 corresponds to the depositional sequences C (mainly Holocene) and B (mainly Plio-Pleistocene). The geoelectric unit GU2 partly correlates with the depositional sequence B which appears to be Plio-Pleistocene in age. The geoelectric unit GU1, which has not been encountered in previous seismic surveys, is a new discovery within Mersin Harbour. Limited correlation between the seismic and resistivity structures in the study area is attributed to differences in the acoustic impedance and resistivity contrasts of sub-bottom layers, as well as the penetration versus resolution performance of the systems.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/0A/32/A1/0A32A115A186D220941FCBAB0615C719.pdf

Investigation of the marl groundwater colloids in steady-state conditions at Wellenberg, shows that their concentration is independent of the water flow rate. Their generation is caused by the re-suspension of the rock clay fraction only. The re-suspension process is presently being studied under flow transient conditions. Extension of our measurements to other safety relevant systems as well as a literature survey show that the colloid concentration under steady-state conditions is correlated to the concentration of alkali elements and earth alkali elements. The higher their respective concentration, the fewer colloids are occurring. Considerations on colloid contamination models are also included.

The distribution of the most common taxa of planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils was estimated quantitatively in 316 samples, collected every 20 cm along the section which is 66.35 in thick. Eleven planktonic foraminifera (only the eight marker events were estimated quantitatively) and five calcareous nannofossil bio-events were identified.

Thereby, it will extend and complement a recent previous study carried out in the Northern Navarra. This paper aim to collect, analyse and evaluate the ethnobotanical knowledge about medicinal plants in the Riverside of Navarra (Iberian Peninsula) with 2554.4 km 2 and 144,674 inhabitants. Material and methods We performed semi-structured interviews with 147 informants (mean age 76 years; the percentage of men and women was almost 50%) in 34 locations, identified the plants reported and analyzed the results, comparing them with those from other territories. Results The informants reported data on 90 medicinal plants belonging to 39 botanical families. This work is focused on human medicinal plant uses, which represent 99% of the pharmaceutical uses (541). The species with the highest number of cites are Santolina chamaecyparissus ssp. squarrosa , Thymus vulgaris , Rosmarinus officinalis and Urtica dioica . All different plant parts are used; aerial part is exploited more frequently than other plant parts. Most of the listed remedies use a single ingredient, typically soaked in water. The percentage of internal uses is three times higher than external uses. Conclusions The main ailments treated are digestive troubles, dermatological problems, and respiratory affections. Informants reported 11 new or scarcely cited uses for 8 medicinal plants. For 50% of the species (4) we have not found bibliographical references in the scientific literature and 50% have only one or two references. Keywords Medicinal plants Traditional knowledge Ethnopharmacology The South of Navarra Spain 1 Introduction Navarra is a territory of 10,421 km 2 placed to the North of the Iberian Peninsula, where three zones can be differed: the Mountain on the North, the Riverside on the South, and both separated by a zone of transition, the Middle Navarra. The Riverside embraces 2554 km 2 and the geomorphology is based on marls and limestone marls with sandstones, gradually yielding to gypsum, gravel, sand and mud which predominate in broad, windswept plains that have been eroded over the course of time ( Gobierno de Navarra, 1997 ). This area is divided into two agricultural regions ( Fig. 1 ): High Riverside (Ribera estellesa, C6: 1225 km 2 ) and Low Riverside (Ribera tudelana, C7: 1329 km 2 ). The seasonal-rainfall Mediterranean bioclimate ( López et al., 2005 ), characterized by seasonal drought (favouring species that are specifically Mediterranean), occupies most of the territory, although there is also a small island of xeric Mediterranean (Bardenas Reales, an area declared a Biosphere reserve by UNESCO on 7 November 2000). The vegetation is obviously conditioned by this kind of bioclimate. The landscape is characterized by intensive agriculture, 70% of the suface ( Peralta, 1997, 2002 ). However, it is possible to find small masses of natural vegetation of holm-oak ( Quercus ilex L. ssp. ballota (Desf.) Samp.), aleppo pine ( Pinus halepensis Miller) as well as plantations of aleppo pine and black poplar ( Populus nigra L.). In addition, riparian vegetation with Alnus Mill., Salix L. and Populus L. populations is near the rivers. Shrubs ( Quercus coccifera L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Genista scorpius (L) DC. and Thymus vulgaris L.), and pastures ( Brachypodium retusum Beauv. and Lygeum spartium L.) are the most frequent. Navarra is officially divided in three linguistic areas, Basque-speaking zone, mixed zone and non Basque-speaking area ( Zabaleta, 1997 ). The studied region is included into the non Basque-speaking zone. The population is around 144,674 inhabitants. C7 region, with 58,401 inhabitants, is the most populated area due to Tudela (its population is around 35,000) is situated in. Tudela, the capital of the Riverside, is the second city of Navarra ( Instituto de Estadística de Navarra, 2008 ). Populations are big, with high distance between them, and people work in agriculture and/or industry mainly. In the last decades, ethnobotanical studies among surviving rural populations in industrialized countries have received growing attention. Many ethnobotanical surveys have been carried out in different areas of the Iberian Peninsula, because a high biological and cultural diversity ( Cavero et al., 2010 and references therein). In Navarra, despite the long tradition of biodiversity and ethnographic studies carried out ( Etniker-Euskalerria, 2004 ), the ethnobotanical value has not received attention, except for some data recently published by our investigation group ( Akerreta et al., 2007a,b, 2010; Cavero et al., 2010 ). To fill this gap, we analyzed the local traditional use (medicinal, veterinary, domestic and food purposes) of wild plants. Specifically, we aimed to compile an ethnobotanical inventory of both past and current uses, assuming that cultural and biological diversities are strongly interrelated and that people living in this area could still retain traditional uses disappeared elsewhere. In this frame, the main aims of the present paper are (i) to contribute to the diffusion of results from the study on the Riverside of Navarra to the scientific community, keeping in mind to open a door for researches on other disciplines and other works (ii) to do a quantitative assessment of the data obtained, comparing with similar studies in other territories, and (iii) to look for vascular plants which have not been previously cited or with scarce previous report on medicinal uses, that might be evaluated in further pharmacological studies. The authors are processing a similar paper titled “Pharmaceutical ethnobotany in the Middle Navarra” to cover all the territory. Comparisons between different zones of Navarra will be later established. 2 Methodology 2.1 Field studies Field and laboratory work began on 2003 and lasted until September 2007. Information was collected using semi-structured ethnobotanical interviews ( Akerreta et al., 2010; Cavero et al., 2010 ). A total of 147 informants were interviewed in 34 locations ( Fig. 1 ). Of those the percentage of men and women was almost 50% (73 men and 74 women). The ages ranged from 22 to 100 year, and mean age are 76 years, value higher than in Northern Navarra ( Cavero et al., 2010 ). In the field work for each species the following data were noted: the local name, place, collection method, drying and preservation system, parts or organs used, method of preparation, dosage, and administration. Plant vouchers were collected, mostly in collaboration with the informants, and authenticated according to Flora Iberica ( Castroviejo, 1986–2005 ) and Flora of the Basque Country ( Aizpuru et al., 2003 ). These vouchers were deposited in the PAMP Herbarium at the School of Science (University of Navarra). After all the information was compiled, a database in Microsoft Access ® was prepared to relate information concerning taxa and their uses, bibliographic references, and the interviewees. 2.2 Data analyses I/P index (number of interview/population of the territory, in percentage) is calculated in order to know if the number of informants is suitable to the scientific validity of results obtained. The minimal number of surveys for a territory in Southern Europe is 0.10% ( Muntané, 2005 ). The population interviewed overcomes this minimum in C6 (0.16%). Nevertheless, in C7, the value is lower (0.06%) due to: (i) the presence of Tudela, the second city with major population of Navarra and, (ii) an important part of the region is constituted by the Bardenas Reales, Biosphere Reserve (45,500 hectares of terrain without inhabitants). The Bardenas Reales, as an ancient royal possession, are not part of any municipal term and are administered directly by the Navarra government. Muntané (2005) used this index for rural zones, big urban areas were not considered; for this reason the number of interviews in the study is suitable in order to obtain results with scientific validity. The accumulation or saturation curves ( Cavero et al., 2010 ) show that the number of informants (147) is enough to confirm that the sample of interviewed population has a sufficient size. The curves are levelled with 80 (C6) and 40 informants (C7). To confirm the degree of originality and novelty of the uses claimed by the informants, they are compared with those reported in more than 250 works on ethnobotany, economic botany, medicinal plants and phytotherapy, mainly ( Akerreta, 2009 , and new references published until nowadays). The plant uses with less of three references are considered as very scarcely reported. Quantitative ethnobotany calculations are performed, allowing us discussing the results and their novelty value comparing with other studies. The following indices are calculated: use values (UV), number of medicinal plants/km 2 , per inhabitant and per informant; and finally the informant consensus factor (FIC) ( Cavero et al., 2010 , for details). 3 Results and discussion A total of 541 pharmaceutical uses are reported from the informants, 99% refer to human medicinal uses belonging to 90 plants (85% native and 15% introduced species from other continents, or other European regions). The complete catalogue of the ethnoflora of the surveyed territory is given in Akerreta (2009) . 3.1 Botanical analyses: families, species and parts of the plants The 90 medicinal plants belong to 39 families, mainly represented by Compositae (20%), Labiatae (12%), Rosaceae (11%), Leguminosae (4%), and Umbelliferae and Urticaceae (3%, each one). The first three families are equally well represented throughout the Iberian Peninsula, and also constitute the major groups of medicinal plant in most of the works that are consulted ( Neves et al., 2009; Benitez et al., 2010; Cavero et al., 2010; González et al., 2010 ). According to the number of given uses, Compositae (35%), Labiatae (15%), Liliaceae (8%), Urticaceae (7%), Rosaceae (6%) and Malvaceae (5%) are the most represented family. ICF's high value (0.83) indicates the great uniformity in the use of some species to treat diseases; if certain plants are effective, there is not need to go looking for others ( Mesa-Jiménez, 1996; Heinrich et al., 1998 ). Table 1 shows a summary of the top 16 vascular plants with traditional phytotherapeutical use: they are the most reported species, the ones that also present a very high number of uses, high number of informants, its use values and a wide diversity range of medical uses. It is worth mentioning these plants, despite they are quite common and very often reported in ethnopharmacological papers, because they provide a good idea of the basic and more rooted ethnobotanical knowledge of the area studied; also, the most original medicinal plant uses in the region prospected, i.e. those not or scarcely previously reported, is presented in Table 2 . The parts of the plant primarily used are the aerial part (44%) and the floral structures (26%) while the leaves (13%) and fruits (9%), are also frequently used. Other parts used are roots and bulb (8%), and occasionally the whole plant and seeds (1%, each one). These percentages are similarly found in other areas ( Agelet and Vallès, 1999; Bonet and Vallès, 2007; Benitez et al., 2010 ) and consistent with the data obtained for parts of plants used in other regions of Navarra ( Cavero et al., 2010 ). Generally, these parts facilitate plant identification and present less difficulties on collection and conservation methods. 3.2 Methods of drug preparation and administration Plants used in traditional remedies are prepared and administered in different forms. The percentage of internal uses is three times higher than external uses (75%, 25%, respectively). These results are different in comparison with the Northern Navarra, where the climate is humid and dermatological affections are frequent ( Cavero et al., 2010 ). The plants are consumed fresh (44%), dry (41%) or indistinctly (11%); different forms of uses of some plants are forgotten (3%). For internal use, tisanes (infusions 62%, decoction 16%) are far followed by maceration with anisette, direct administration or comestible and vapours (5%, each one). The most important forms of preparation for external uses are poultices (30%), direct administration (23%), and ointments (13%); in lower proportion, baths and alcohol maceration (8%, 7%, respectively). It is difficult to establish a quantitative formulation of remedies, because dosages are not always known (or only approximately given, almost never in units such as grams). 3.3 Main affections treated The most treated illnesses or troubles we group in 12 pathological groups. Other group is also considerate: “various” in which the use-reports of unspecified diseases appear; and “magical” medicinal uses ( Tables 1 and 2 ). We found 218 (37%) remedies to treat digestive problems (digestive, carminative, diarrhoea, evil tripe, laxative, purgative, stomach ache, to be a had mood); 90 (15%) remedies to cure dermatological problems (furuncles, burn, acne, skin ulcers and cracks, warts, chilblains, herpes, skin spots, and wounds); 86 (14%) remedies for respiratory tract infections (cough, sore-throat, cold, and catarrh). 57 (11%) remedies to cardio-vascular conditions (hypertension, to purify or clean the blood, diuretic, Anti-haemorrhoidal -piles-, for blood circulation); other remedies are mainly used to nervous system (28 remedies, 5%) and joints and rheumatism (22 remedies, 4%). Digestive and dermatologic problems are also the most cited in similar studies ( González-Tejero, 1989; Mulet, 1991; Heinrich et al., 1998; Bonet et al., 1999; Camejo-Rodrigues et al., 2003; Macía et al., 2005; Libman et al., 2006; Aburjai et al., 2007; Cavero et al., 2010 ). Teas and chamomiles for digestive remedies: there are two groups of species, one with names derived from “manzanilla” or “chamomile” and other one from “té” (tea). Santolina chamaecyparissus ssp. squarrosa is the most cited plant (76 uses); other “manzanillas” are Helichrysum stoechas (20 uses), Chamomilla recutita (4 uses) and Chamaemelum nobile (2 uses). The same species has been cited by Pardo de Santayana and Morales (2006, 2010) . On the other hand, attention should be focused on the use of plants popularly known as “té”, which correctly refers to Jasonia glutinosa and Jasonia tuberosa (10 uses, each one). Bidens aurea (9 uses) is a tea which is known today only in a few places in the south of Navarra. A native of Central America, it was brought back by a missionary friar many decades ago, according to our interview data. It used to be grown, but now occurs as an invader in irrigation channels ( Pardo de Santayana et al., 2005; Akerreta et al., 2007a,b ). In addition, Glycyrrhiza glabra as carminative and Prunus spinosa for stomach ache (10 uses, each one) are two frequently used species. The most usual method of preparation with the fresh fruits of Prunus spinosa is maceration with anisette (with a use entirely internal and digestive), as in the case of the preparation called ‘patxaran’, the most famous and characteristic liquor not only in this region but also of Navarra as a whole ( Akerreta et al., 2007a,b; Cavero et al., 2010 ). Urtica dioica is one of the most mentioned plants ( Table 1 , 32 uses, 1.2 UV) for alterations of the circulatory system (15 uses) and respiratory affections (3 uses). In this study many plants are used in cataplasms, direct applications and ointments for skin problems: Allium cepa (19 uses) and Hylotelephium maximum (13 uses). The pathologies treated with Malva sylvestris and Thymus vulgaris were mainly gastrointestinal diseases (including those of animals) and respiratory affections, in accordance to many other studies ( De Natale and Pollio, 2007; Cornara et al., 2009; Neves et al., 2009; Idolo et al., 2010 ). At present, 10 plants are collected for their use in cookery. Among them 9 species are reported also for therapeutic use: Foeniculum vulgare and Taraxacum officinale as depurative; Origanum vulgare ssp. virens , O. vulgare ssp. vulgare , T. officinale , Thymus vulgaris and Laurus nobilis , for digestive problems; and Allium sativum is consumed in salad as flavouring, to rheumatism and arthritis. Medicago sativa is used only as food. Some of these uses have been previously reported ( Vitalini et al., 2009 ) 3.4 Quantitative ethnobotany Quantitative data collection from ethnobotanical studies is turning to be essential for carrying out more solid comparisons between other ethnobotany works that use the same methodology ( Hoffman and Gallaher, 2007; Tardío and Pardo de Santayana, 2008; Parada et al., 2009 ). Table 3 shows some quantitative data on medicinal plants from 32 regions of the Iberian territories, including the two in the present study (Riverside: C6 and C7). The number of informants for this study (253), the number of medicinal plants reported (90), value of medicinal plants per informant (0.61), medicinal plants/km 2 (0.03) and per inhabitant (6.22 × 10 −4 ) is calculated. Comparisons of these results with other similar works in the Iberian Peninsula showed lower values due to: (i) 70% of these regions are focused to intensive agricultural fields and related industries; (ii) presence of Tudela and the Bardenas Reales. These facts influence directly in the loss of habitats, traditional practices and traditional culture, reasons that might explain these values. 3.5 New or scarcely reported medicinal plants Informants reported 11 scarcely cited plant uses for 8 species (9% of total) which are mentioned as medicinal. These plants are compiled in Table 2 , which includes, apart from plant nomenclature, plant activities as claimed by the informants, followed by the therapeutical category in brackets, and references. Moreover, their ways of preparation and administration are also referred. For 50% of the species (4) we have not found scientific references: Potentilla reptans to treat the piles, Cardus pycnocephalus ssp. pycnocephalus to cure wounds, Pelargonium sp. to constipation, Petroselinum crispum as abortive. The other four species have only one or two references. The “magical” medicinal category includes, according to our interpretation, remedies not explained on the basis of pharmaceutical properties of the plant but rather on an intense faith in the fulfilment of its mission. In many cases, there is no ingestion of the plant or even topical contact. In this type of magical ritual, the use of Potentilla reptans as antihaemorrhoidal is reported; the fresh plant is kept in a bag in the belief that when dries it cures the haemorrhoids. This has no scientific basis nowadays, but folklore continues to give equal importance to both conceptions of illness and remedy. Another interesting species reported by 4 informants is Foeniculum vulgare : the fresh plant is boiled and eaten to clean the body (depurative). The scarce references show that these plants could be interesting for future studies. 3.6 Other information Non-medicinal information concerning the use of 6 species has been reported. Informants use Juniperus oxycedrus and Quercus ilex ssp. ballota as wood for fires at home in winter. Foeniculum vulgare is used to aromatize the barrel of wine; Lavandula latifolia to make colony; the fruits of Rubus ulmifolius boiled and crushed as ink to write; and Arctium minus to dye one's hair black. 4 Concluding remarks The present study adds to the ethnobotanical map of the Riverside Navarra, an important number of species and medicinal uses. The pathologies treated by these plants are not serious, involving mainly the digestive, dermal and respiratory systems. The families that added the highest number of medicinal species to the ethnobotanical catalogue are Compositae and Labiatae . We analyse the factors underlying the high use of plants from these two families. The species most referenciated are Santolina chamaecyparissus ssp. squarrosa , Thymus vulgaris , Rosmarinus officinalis and Urtica dioica . The transmission of knowledge from the old to the new generation is declining. The medicinal plant harvesting is a tradition that younger generation are losing. Only elderly people still use traditional medicine for the treatment of different diseases remembering several methods of remedy preparation, but most of them prefer the orthodox medicine. The preserved ethnobotanical knowledge was based on the collective tradition and the memories of their parents and grandparents. Our work can be an aid to prevent from totally losing the ethnobotanical traditions of the Riverside Navarra and to stress the need to safeguard its plant biodiversity. It is, in fact, a rare and precious natural heritage to be protected for the future generations. Further studies on phytochemical and biological activity should also be conducted on the reported medicinal plants of this area so as to utilize them in drug development.

Interpretation of results from direct tracer sampling in terms of operative hydraulic processes is often limited by the poor spatial coverage and the invasive nature of such techniques. Cross-borehole electrical imaging during progress of saline tracer migration is proposed to assist investigation of field-scale solute transport in the unsaturated zone. Electrical imaging provides non-destructive, high density and spatially continuous sampling of saline tracer transport injected over an area of the ground surface between two boreholes. The value of electrical imaging was tested at a field site on an interfluve of the UK Chalk aquifer. Improved understanding of active transport mechanisms in the unsaturated zone of the UK Chalk is required to predict its vulnerability to surface pollutants. In a tracer experiment in May 1996, a conductive saline tracer was infiltrated over 18 m(2) at an average rate of 47 mm day(-1) for 56 hours. Cross-borehole images obtained during and after infiltration show a large, homogenous, resistivity reduction in the top 3 m, no change between 3 m and 6 m depth, and smaller, inhomogeneous, resistivity reductions below 6 m depth. The resistivity has reduced at down to 15 m depth less than 2 days after tracer infiltration began. Hydrological interpretation of a sequence of electrical images obtained prior to, during, and up to three months after tracer injection suggests: (1) rapid tracer entry into the soil zone and upper 2 m of weathered Chalk, (2) intergranular transport of the bulk of the tracer, (3) a significant fissure flow component transporting tracer to at least 15 m depth in 31 hours, and (4) vertical changes in transport mechanisms possibly caused by interception of fissures by marl layers. The results of this experiment suggest that electrical imaging can assist the description of unsaturated zone hydraulic mechanisms through visual identification of spatial and temporal variations in transport processes.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/80/AC/25/80AC259149E7E2CF5A2DDB6BE606D00A.pdf

With the aim of applying this methodology, the regional Jurassic aquifer included in the Hydrogeological Unit 08.07 (Maestrazgo, Castellón) was selected as pilot area. The reason for the preference of this area was the large thickness of the sedimentary sequence of this aquifer subsystem. Besides, in the main part of it, the satured zone was located down to a depth of more than 300 m: made up of carbonated formations (limestones, dolomites and marls) from lower Cretaceous-Jurassic age. The ultimate aim of the study will be to integrate the information obtained from the specialities concerned: Geology, Stratigraphy, Structural Analysis, Hydrogeology, Hydrochemistry, Geophysics and Remote Sensing and enable us to obtain a methodology for characterization of deep aquifers, with similar characteristics, as well as to define a hydrogeological conceptual model that integrates the geological model.

Dagpazari formation is composed of mudstone, siltstone, sandstone and conglomerates. Facies associations of the formation arc: fluvial, lagoon, shoal-water delta, shoreface, beach and barrier island deposits. Loxoconcha turn ida Brady and Loxoconcha sp. in the gray mudstones indicate the freshwater influence and decrease in salinity. Hemicyprideis sp. documents brackish water conditions. The shoreface sandstones alternating with the lagoonal mudstones, and oyster-rich beach deposits in different levels of the sequence indicate episodes of marine connections. The age of the Dagpazari formation is provided by the planktonic foraminifera from the marine mudstones and marls below and above the formation, and corresponds to the MMi8-MMi10 biostratigraphic interval, which spans the late Serravallian-early Tortonian. Late Serravallian eustatic sea-level fall caused to the quick shallowing of the Mut Basin and subaerial exposure of the reefal limestones at the basin margin. Thus, the incised valley, formed upon the reefal limestones of the Mut formation. This incised valley reflects a regional forced regression and unconformity. The Dagpazri formation was deposited within this incised valley following an early Tortonian relative sea-level rise.",,

This stratigraphic succession represents a complex sequence-stratigraphic framework. The Cambrian System in the study area constitutes two second-order sequences that can further be subdivided into twelve third-order sequences, and forms a regularly cyclic transgression-regression succession. There are regularly vertical stacking patterns,representing third-order sequences in the second-order sequence.From the Diandongian and the Qiandongian Series, third-order sequences characterized by “CS (condensed section)+HST (high-stand system tract) successions shift to those characterized by “TST (transgressive system tract)+CS+HST” successions. Correspondingly, drowning-type sequence boundaries are changed into exposure-type ones. Therefore, both the second-order and the third-order sequences have a similar sedimentary-facies pattern. In the middle-upper Cambrian second-order sequence is characterized by a generally upward shoaling successions with several features showing strong differences from the lower Cambrian second-order sequence.Firstly, massive dolostones poor in fossils, i.e. the Loushanguan Group, are transgressively pinched out from northwest to southeast in the study area. Secondly, there is no condensed-section unit in sequences in the Loushanguan Group. In contrast, the early Cambrian Diandongian and the Qiandongian Series contain five third-order sequences with a thickness of over 1000 m but grade into a condensed succession where third-order sequences cannot be identified toward the deeper water southeast Yangize reigion.In the Wulingian and the Furongian Series, a set of dolomites deposited in shallow-water platform facies in the northwest is changed into a set of shales and marls of shelf facies fundamental southeast. Therefore, the Cambrian sequence-stratigraphic framework in the study area can demonstrate both in the features of third-order sequences, i.e. the regularity of sedimentary-facies successions in space and the synchroneity of sedimentary-environment changes in time.Futhermore, two kinds of facies-changing surface and two kinds of diachrononeity can be recognized in the Cambrian sequences in the upper Yangtze region.Under this sequence-stratigraphic framework, it is possible to observe several interesting patterns of Cambrian biological evolution. During the period of the first second-order transgression in the early Cambrian, several biotas such as the Small-Shelly Biota, the Songlin Biota, and the Zunyi Biota that is coeval to the Chengjiang Biota,record spectacular biological diversity-events.During the second second-order transgression in the early-middle Cambrian, the Taijiang and Kaili biotas record other spectacular biological diversity-events. Whether regressive events are genetically related to biological extinction events remains uncertain. To better understand the complex relationship between transgressive-regressive events and biological diversity-events, many sequence-stratigraphic problems need to be clarified.",,

Baltic kukersite shale (degree of transformation—early catagenesis) is used as an example. It is emphasized that the fluid permeability of this shale layer is manifested locally in tectonic disturbances, buried erosional valleys, and linear structural-deformation zones. The quality of shale in these zones deteriorates (the calorific value, the yield of tar, etc., decrease), and it is partially decarbonized (and decarbonated) and deformed; the shale acquires increased permeability, and its bed thickness decreases and marl varieties become more terrigenous. It is asserted that these phenomena were caused by the partial (and sometimes almost complete) loss of kukersite in the test sections of COM. The decrease of the organic matter caused the liberation of void space and then deformations, the disturbance of the integrity of layers, an increase in the permeability, and the loss of the status of fuels by the initial shale. The relationship of the degradation of the COM of shale with sulfate reduction processes in the underground hydrosphere at the early catagenic stage of the existence of a shale layer is substantiated.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/B9/27/3E/B9273E94F68D89AC2BB2BDCE3B552959.pdf

These rocks constutes the most important Cretaceous oil reservoir in the Middle East. The dependent tools are petrography, field study and the concept of drowning phases. This concept is relatively new and accurate in explanation of development of carbonate sequences growth and termination. The columns of both carbonate and elastics rocks of the area are divided into three phases of drowning:1- Pre-drowning phase of reefal limestone which is represented by Qamchuqa Formation which is equivalent to Mauddud and Shuaba formations (Early Cretaceous) in the south Iraq and in the Gulf 2- Transitional phase of pelagic limestone and marl deposition which is transitional to post drowning phase during which Gulneri Shale and Dokan limestone Formations (CenomanianTuronian) are deposited. 3- Post drowning phase of deep carbonate sedimentation during which Kometan Formation (SantonianCampanian) and 4- Burial Phase in which Shiranish and Tanjero Formations (Maasstrichtian) are deposited by which Arabian Platform was covered by siliciclastics sediments and main carbonate sedimentation was ended during Campanian. These phases, as resulted from tectonics of Zagros, can replace the complex previously assigned tectonic and depositional history of the area during Later Cretaceous. The application of the phases revealed nearly a continuous history of deposition in foredeep during Early Cretaceous and foreland basin during later ages.This continuous sedimentation is opposite to previously cited episodic sedimentation in the Cretaceous basins. Moreover than that, the occurrences of the previously mentioned subaerial cycles of erosion (unconformities) are not ascertained. The previous cycles had segmented the rocks and history of the area into several separated and unrelated tectonic events that occurred in different basins. According to the above cycles and unconformities the tectonic setting and depositional history of the whole northwestern Iraq assumed be violent during compete time span of the Late Cretaceous by which basin isolation and uplift and erosion occurred. The above ideas are amended and the unconformable boundaries are changed to conformable ones. Consequently, in the present study, a new tectonic history and model are established for Cretaceous which agree with field observation and existed lithofacies.",,
5f0dd4cb9fced0a24b360a83,Celitement® – A new sustainable hydraulic binder based on calcium hydrosilicates,,"[{'name': 'P  Stemmermann'}, {'name': 'Beuchle'}, {'name': 'Garbev'}, {'name': 'Schweike'}]","Celitement is a new family of cementitious binders, similar in mixing, setting and hardening to standardized cements based on OPC. However, its production on an industrial scale could save up to an estimated 50% CO2-emission and primary energy. It is based on a new class of amorphous hydraulic calcium hydrosilicates. Hardening proceeds through formation of Calcium Silicate Hydrate phases (C-S-H) comparable to those from OPC hydration. No other hydration products are necessarily formed. Suitable raw materials for the production of Celitement include carbonates, e.g. marl or limestone and a wide range of natural and secondary silicates e.g. natural sand, slags, glasses and fly ash. Carbonates are calcined before processing. The carbonate fraction in the raw material varies in the range from 30 to 40% (OPC about 75%). In the most simple case quicklime and quartz sand are used; the use of hot meal from clinker production is also possible. About one half of the raw material, which includes all the calcined lime, is hydrothermally treated in an autoclave at temperatures around 200C and saturated steam pressure. Calcium silicate hydrates are formed similar to the processing of autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC). In a second step the synthesised calcium silicate hydrates are mixed and milled together with the remaining siliceous materials. During milling hydrogen bonds, which stabilize the autoclaved products, are destroyed and new amorphous calcium hydrosilicates are formed around cores of non reactive co-milled silicates. Due to its simple phase content Celitement enables simple formulations. Compressive strength, freeze-thaw resistance and shrinkage resemble standardized cements. Since newly formed C-S-H-phases are the only hydration product of Celitement, the heat of hydration is strongly reduced. Capillary pores are quickly transformed to gel pores, which has been demonstrated by SEM and Hg-porosimetry. Calcination of limestone is the dominant endothermic step in cement production and responsible for the fast majority of CO2-emissions. Reduction in energy demand and CO2 emission mainly result from the strongly reduced carbonate content of the raw material. The necessary thermal treatment (calcination, 1000C hydrothermal processing, 200C) takes place at comparatively low temperatures (OPC up to 1450C). In addition, only about half of the raw material is thermally processed at all. Celitement and the process for its production are proprietary inventions of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The production capacity is 1 kg/day at the moment. At present a pilot plant is constructed with a production capacity of 100 kg/d, which will be in operation in 2011, in collaboration with the SCHWENK group as industrial partner. In 2014 a first plant is scheduled to enter commercial production. Originality The contribution presents for the first time hydraulic calcium hydrosilicates as one member of a new type of sustainable hydraulic binders. In order to produce the materials an innovative new concept of coupling a hydrothermal and a mechanical process has been developed. Composition range, processing intermediates and final product are presented. Energy and carbon footprint of the process are estimated. Important material properties of hydrated samples, e.g. standardized compressive strength, freeze-thaw resistance, pore size analysis etc. are discussed. The contribution HYDRATION BEHAVIOR OF CELITEMENT: KINETICS, PHASE COMPOSITION, MICROSTRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES by Garbev, K. et al. describes the hydration process in detail. Chief contributions A new amorphous type of calcium hydrosilicate has been synthesized for the first time. It is hydraulic and hardens under formation of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H), similar to the ones from OPC hydration. No other hydrates, especially no portlandite, AFm and AFt are formed. Thus, compared to OPC, only roughly half the mass fraction of the new binder is needed to produce the same amount of C-S-H-“glue”. In order to keep the volume of the binder matrix constant, the new calcium hydrosilicates are diluted with non-reactive silicates. The concept results in an estimated reduction of 50% in energy consumption and CO2 emission in production. The product is similar to OPC in all its major qualities, except the development of porosity. The transformation of capillary porosity to gel porosity is much quicker then for OPC. For production, a new process has been developed, which comprises a hydrothermal and a milling step. Estimated production costs do not exceed conventional OPC manufacturing.",,

This study investigates the utility of the land degradation index (LDI) approach to express land degradation in a small Mediterranean watershed with enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) data. The LDI is based on the concept of the soil line, and was elaborated from advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) sensor data and field spectra measurements. The implementation of the LDI index uses all the bands of the spectral domain in the visible, near infrared (NIR), and short wave infrared (SWIR). Field measurements were carried out in the Saboun experimental basin located in a marl soil region of the Moroccan western Rif for which soil, hydrological, and erosion databases were readily available. The present study provided the opportunity for studying and characterizing the state of soil degradation using the LDI. Our results show the interest of the use of the LDI with ASTER data to study or to map land degradation. It provides more accurate results (Kappa = 0,79) when compared with results obtained with ETM+ data (Kappa = 0,57). Globally, the results represent ground reality with sufficient accuracy to help decision makers in their soil conservation planning process.",,

In the department of Haute-Vienne, spring-born snails aestivated with their apertures applied to the surface of a substratum and most of them were located on the banks of ditches. With the return of wet conditions, the survival of these snails was low. In the department of Indre, most springborn snails aestivated by burrowing into the marl and were distributed over the whole surface area of their habitats. Higher survivals were noted for these O. glabra after aestivation. Despite a significant difference in the frequencies of buried lymnaeids, the position of snails with a natural infection with E hepatica in their dried habitats was similar to that found for uninfected ones. The variations found in the aestivation of O. glabra might be explained by the dominant substratum (granite gravel and scarce mud in Haute-Vienne, or a thick layer of marl in Indre) and the plant cover on ditch bottoms.",,

These sandstone beds have a complex architecture, varying with depth of deposition. At neritic to upper-bathyal depths (100 to 500 m) the sandstone beds can consistently be subdivided into three (some- times four) successive lithological units. From bottom to top, the units decrease in grain size and change in composition and texture. The first unit (I) is characterized by millimeter-sized particles: spherules and other splash-form particles with internal filled vesicles and limestone clasts; both are interpreted as altered impact ejecta. Those ejecta, mixed with clay/marl rip-up clasts from underlying formations, washed-out foraminifers, and various material scavenged from the seafloor, fill shallow channel- like depressions. The second unit (II) consists of a sequence of several lenticular sand- stone layers made up of a mixture of foraminifers, bioclasts, plant remains, and terrigenous material. The sandstones may be massive, graded, or parallel- or current- ripple laminated. Some rare spherules and limestone clasts infrequently occur at the base of each layer. The Unit II sands are deposited in very shallow, stacked channels or erosional depression infillings and display a variety of sedimentary features containing evidence for repeated up-section changes in current direction and current strength. The third unit (III) consists of strings of fine sand ripples alternating with thin silt lay- ers. Only Unit III and the overlying unit (IV) contain anomalous iridium and Ni-rich spinels, concentrated in the silt layers. Unit IV is a graded silt-mudstone, representing a quiet depositional phase of fine material, settling—over at least a few days—together with the fine iridium-rich dust. The coarser basal units in particular show internal unconformable stratigraphic relationships, but all the units and beds are amalgamated on top of each other, with-",,

Here we describe an unusual case of bioerosion on a turtle carapace of Hispaniachelys prebetica from the Oxfordian (around 155 Ma, Upper Jurassic) of the Prebetic (Betic Cordillera, South Spain). The specimen was found in a limestone bed of a marl-limestone rhythmite. Morphological analysis of the bioerosive structures reveals the dominance of epigenic traces produced by the grazing activity of regular sea urchins (ichnospecies Gnathichnus pentax). No other bioerosion structures are present. From an ethologic point of view only epigenic traces (pascichnia) are present. Gnathichnus pentax records short-term bioerosion produced exclusively on the carapace before its burial. The ichnological assemblage recorded herein typifies the Gnathichnus Ichnofacies. The carapace was the most favourable hard substrate for grazers in comparison to the surrounding muddy soft bottom. The carapace was oriented convex-down when found in. the rock. Therefore, pascichnial activity probably occurred early after the death and accumulation on the sea floor of the turtle remains, but before the carapace was overturned by large scavengers. The low degree of fragmentation and the low dispersion of skeletal components indicate a low-energy environment and early burial in the sea bottom.",,

As referring to the ecosystem functions of these constructions, when extensive such systems prevent any runoff into the fluvial system. The extent to which these dams and terraces resist major events is variable, and earthen dams can be major sediment sources. Extensification and increasing mechanization of rainfed agriculture in marginal areas have led to a change in cropping systems. Large-scale almond and olive plantations with widely spaced trees do not rely on runoff water, but draw the soil water from a large soil volume of bare soil maintained by regular shallow tillage. The high density of terraces has now become a nuisance to the farmers. The aim of this paper is to i) demonstrate the degradation of SWC structures and the relative importance of the driving forces, ii) assess the limits of the protection that earthen dams can provide by surveying their resistance during a heavy storm (return period 8.2 years) and iii) demonstrate the implications of the abandonment of SWC structures over the period 1956–2005 for the hydrological connectivity between croplands and the ephemeral rivers system. The headwaters of a marl catchment with a continuous area treated with SWC structures in Murcia region (Spain) already had a very high density of step terraces and check dams (182 m ha−1) in 1956. This density decreased by 27% in the period 1956–2005. Furthermore, many terraces have not been maintained and flow traces indicate that they no longer retain water. This is particularly true for the check dams in abandoned lands. The distance between the step terraces has increased over time, making them vulnerable to erosion. The mean drainage area of the dams that failed during the heavy storm was significantly (3.16 ha) higher than that of the ones that remained intact (1.11 ha). The probability of failure increases with drainage area from P=0.16 for an area of 1.8 ha to P=0.8 for an area of 20 ha. The percentage of cropland draining directly on the river system without interference of a check dam has increased from just 9% in 1956 to 31% in 2005 and 40% after the storm in November 2006.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/97/A5/D3/97A5D33512A360BB7E1FE2AF5E486C1E.pdf

Methods Activity of the major signaling pathways that regulate glucose uptake was assessed by western immunoblot in C2C12 muscle cells treated with extracts from these plant species. Effects of extracts on mitochondrial function were assessed by respirometry in isolated rat liver mitochondria. Metabolic stress induced by extracts was assessed by measuring ATP concentration and rate of cell medium acidification in C2C12 myotubes and H4IIE hepatocytes. Extracts were applied at a dose of 15–100 μg/ml. Results The effect of all seven products was achieved through a common mechanism mediated not by the insulin signaling pathway but rather by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in response to the disruption of mitochondrial function and ensuing metabolic stress. Disruption of mitochondrial function occurred in the form of uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and/or inhibition of ATPsynthase. Activity of the AMPK pathway, in some instances comparable to that stimulated by 4 mM of the AMP-mimetic AICAR, was in several cases sustained for at least 18 h post-treatment. Duration of metabolic stress, however, was in most cases in the order of 1 h. Conclusions The mechanism common to the seven products studied here is analogous to that of the antidiabetic drug Metformin. Of interest is the observation that metabolic stress need not be sustained in order to induce important adaptive responses. The results support the use of these products as culturally adapted treatments for insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in susceptible aboriginal populations where adherence to modern diabetes pharmaceuticals is an issue. The mechanism reported here may be widespread and mediate the antidiabetic activity of traditional remedies from various other cultures. Keywords Traditional medicine Type II diabetes Intracellular signaling pathways AMP-activated protein kinase Mitochondrial energy transduction Metabolic stress 1 Introduction Aboriginal populations the world over are predisposed to the development of type II diabetes ( Yu and Zinman, 2007 ). When this susceptibility is compounded by the cultural disconnection of modern pharmaceuticals, the prevalence rates of diabetic complications can reach alarming levels. These complications more than diabetes itself impact quality of life and longevity and represent important social and economic burdens. In native populations of Canada, such as the Cree of Iiyiyiu Istchii (James Bay region), the prevalence rate of type II diabetes is 3–5 higher than in non-native populations ( Kuzmina and Dannenbaum, 2004; Kuzmina et al., 2008; Young et al., 2000 ) and, due to cultural disconnection to modern treatment options, the prevalence rate of complications is disproportionately high. Our team has taken a novel approach to address this specific situation; in close collaboration with the Cree of Iiyiyiu Istchii, we are attempting to improve diabetes treatments by developing culturally adapted complementary and alternative options that are based on products of this population's own pharmacopeia. Plant products with hyperglycemia-normalizing activity are common in the traditional medicine of cultures throughout the world ( Haddad et al., 2006; Marles and Farnsworth, 1995 ). The efficacy of several of these products has been demonstrated in clinical and animal studies. In some cases, active principles have also been identified. These natural products represent a rich source of alternatives and complements to the limited number of antidiabetic medications currently on the market. Furthermore, in populations with limited access to modern pharmaceuticals or with a cultural preference for traditional remedies, these products often represent the main treatment option for diabetes. Perhaps the most important testimony to the importance and efficacy of antidiabetic natural products comes from the widely used antidiabetic drug Metformin and the other members of the biguanide class. Indeed, these drugs are based on naturally occurring guanidines isolated in the 1920s from Galega officinalis (French lilac), a plant used for centuries to treat diabetes ( Cavaliere, 2007; Witters, 2001 ). The biguanides act not by increasing insulin secretion, but rather by decreasing gluconeogenesis and increasing glucose uptake ( Giannarelli et al., 2003 ). While the biguanides have been on the market since the 1950s, the major breakthrough in understanding their mode of action occurred in 2001 when the enzyme adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was found to play a central role in their effects ( Zhou et al., 2001 ). This highly conserved enzyme is exquisitely sensitive to disruptions in cellular energy homeostasis and is now recognized as both a master regulatory enzyme of metabolism and an important therapeutic target for diabetes and metabolic diseases ( Misra, 2008; Viollet et al., 2009 ). Activation of AMPK triggers cytoprotective responses to acutely restore energy homeostasis and to chronically protect against future perturbations, including stimulation of transport and oxidation of glucose and fats, increased expression of key genes of glucose and fat metabolism, and mitochondrial biogenesis ( Reznick and Shulman, 2006; Winder, 2001 ). In recent years, many plant products and naturally occurring compounds have been shown to activate AMPK ( Ahn et al., 2008; Collins et al., 2007; Hayashi et al., 2000; Hwang et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2007, 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Mooney et al., 2008; Park et al., 2007; Zang et al., 2006 ). In many, if not all cases, a site of action of these products is the mitochondrial inner membrane or a protein thereof ( Dorta et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2006; Polya, 2003; Trumbeckaite et al., 2006 ), with the effect of disrupting oxidative phosphorylation and decreasing the capacity for aerobic ATP synthesis. If mitochondrial energy production becomes insufficient to meet the cellular energy demand, energy homeostasis is perturbed and AMPK is activated. Targeting of energy transduction pathways is consistent with the defensive antimicrobial and insecticidal functions of plant secondary metabolites ( Polya, 2003 ). Mild and transient disruption of mitochondrial function is believed to be the primary mechanism of action of Metformin, shown to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation at complex I of the electron transport chain ( El-Mir et al., 2000; Owen et al., 2000 ). As aerobic energy production is compromised, the cell must increasingly rely on ATP synthesized anaerobically through glycolysis. Consequently, the primary danger associated with this mode of action is metabolic acidosis. Indeed, acidosis is the most important complication of biguanide use ( Luft et al., 1978 ). Furthermore, consumption of Galega officinalis by grazing livestock can result in this condition as well ( Cavaliere, 2007 ). Our team has recently conducted a successful screening project of medicinal plant species of the Canadian boreal forest stemming from the traditional medicine of the Cree of Iiyiyiu Istchii ( Leduc et al., 2006; Spoor et al., 2006 ). Seven of eight ethnobotanically selected species were found to enhance glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells in the absence of insulin by 10–45% ( Spoor et al., 2006 ), an effect similar to that of Metformin ( Klip et al., 1992; Spoor et al., 2006 ). This activity had not previously been ascribed to these species. The goal of the present work was to determine the molecular events through which these effects are mediated. Our findings indicate that all seven plant products act through the AMPK pathway and that activation of this pathway results from a transient disruption of mitochondrial function. These findings further support the use of these products as culturally adapted alternative anti-hyperglycemic therapies. These findings also suggest that this mode of action may be widespread among medicinal plant species and natural health products with antidiabetic activity. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant materials The following eight products of Canadian boreal forest medicinal plant species were the objects of this study: inner bark of Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.; inner bark of Alnus incana ssp. Rugosa (Du Roi) R.T. Clausen; inner bark of Larix laricina K. Koch; cones of Picea mariana ; cones of Pinus banksiana Lamb.; leaves of Rhododendron groenlandicum (Oeder) Kron & Judd; leaves of Sarracenia purpurea L.; inner bark of Sorbus decora C.K. Schneid. The collection, handling, and extraction of plant material have previously been described ( Spoor et al., 2006 ). Briefly, plant material was collected in 2003 in Mistissini, QC, Canada. Material was collected from several specimens and pooled. Species were identified by a plant taxonomist (Dr. Alain Cuerrier, Montreal Botanical Garden, Montreal, QC) and voucher specimens were deposited at the Marie-Victorin Herbarium of the Montreal Botanical Garden (specimens # Mis03-1, Mis03-2, Mis03-4, Mis03-5, Mis03-8, Mis03-12, Mis03-14, and Mis03-15). Plant material was extracted at the University of Ottawa. Material from each species was dried in a fruit dryer at 35 °C, cleaned, and ground using a Wiley Mill with a mesh size of 2 mm. Ground material was extracted twice for 24 h in 80% ethanol (10 ml/g dry material) on a mechanical shaker at ambient temperature and then filtered through Whatman #1 paper. The supernatants of first and second extractions were pooled, evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporator (RE500; Yamamoto Scientific Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a water bath temperature of 40 °C, and lyophilized in a freeze dryer (Super Moduylo; Thermo Fisher, Ottawa, ON) to produce a crude ethanol extract (referred to as crude extract from this point on). Extraction yields (%) were as follows: Abies balsamea 15; Alnus incana 26; Larix laricina 24; Picea mariana 21; Pinus banksiana 9; Rhododendron groenlandicum 31; Sarracenia purpurea 25; Sorbus decora 9 ( Spoor et al., 2006 ). Dried crude extracts were preserved at 4 °C in a dessicator and protected from light until further use. Extracts were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma–Aldrich, Oakville, ON) at 1000× their final working concentration, filter sterilized, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. On the day of an experiment, an aliquot was thawed and diluted in culture medium at 1:1000. Final working concentrations in microgram crude extract/ml were as follows: Abies balsamea 50; Alnus incana 50; Larix laricina 25; Picea mariana 10; Pinus banksiana 15; Rhododendron groenlandicum 75; Sarracenia purpurea 100; Sorbus decora 15. These concentrations have previously been determined to be optimal and non-toxic for C2C12 muscle cells over a treatment duration of 24 h ( Spoor et al., 2006 ). Final DMSO concentration was 0.1% in all experiments. A preliminary phytochemical characterization of the extracts, including determination of total concentration of phenolics and identification and quantification of marker compounds, has been reported elsewhere ( Spoor et al., 2006 ). 2.2 Cell culture C2C12 murine skeletal myoblasts and H4IIE rat hepatocytes were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO 2 /95% air atmosphere. Culture reagents were purchased from Wisent (St-Bruno, QC). As previously described ( Benhaddou-Andaloussi et al., 2008; Martineau et al., 2006; Spoor et al., 2006; Vuong et al., 2007 ), myoblasts were proliferated to confluence in high-glucose DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10% horse serum (HS; Sigma–Aldrich), and antibiotics. These cells were then differentiated into multinucleated myotubes over a 7-day period in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 2% HS. Experiments with C2C12 cells were always timed to end on day 7 of differentiation. Hepatocytes were proliferated to confluence in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. H4IIE experiments were performed between post-confluence days 1 and 3. 2.3 Western immunoblot studies of phospho-Akt, -AMPK, and -ACC contents Content of phosphorylated protein kinase Akt (Ser 473) was measured by western immunoblot in order to assess activation of the insulin signaling pathway. Similarly, contents of phosphorylated AMPKalpha (catalytic subunit; Thr 172) and phosphorylated acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC; Ser 79) were measured as markers of activation of the AMPK pathway. Reagents were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich unless otherwise noted. Primary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies Inc. (cat. # 9271, 2531, 3661; Danvers, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. (cat. # 111-035-144; West Grove, PA). C2C12 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and proliferated and differentiated as above. Cells were treated with extract or vehicle (DMSO) 18, 6, or 1 h before lysis on day 7 of differentiation. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1β-riboside (AICAR; Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., North York, ON) was used as a positive control for the AMPK pathway; AICAR was dissolved in water and applied at a final concentration of 4 mM to a subgroup of vehicle control wells 30 min prior to lysis. At the end of the treatment period, plates were placed on ice and cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 8.1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.47 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4, 2.68 mM KCl, 0.137 M NaCl) and covered with 250 μl/well of HEPES lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Na deoxycholate, 0.1% Na dodecyl sulphate (SDS)) containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Complete-Mini EDTA-free; Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QC; supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM NaF, 100 μM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 mM Na 4 P 2 O 7 ). Cells were scraped and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. The tubes were vortexed and kept on ice for 30 min with frequent vortexing. Tubes were then centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were decanted into new tubes, and these lysates were frozen at −80 °C until analysis. The protein content of the cell lysates was measured using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. An equal amount of total protein from each sample was denatured by boiling 5 min in reducing sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS) ( Laemmli, 1970 ). One hundred micrograms of each sample in a 100 μl volume were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( Shapiro et al., 1967 ) using a Protean IIxi apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The resolving gel was composed of a 6.5% acrylamide phase over a 10% acrylamide phase, and the stacking gel was 5% acrylamide. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C in migration buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS) at 50 mA for 3 h followed by 25 mA for 14 h. Resolved samples were then electrotransferred ( Towbin et al., 1979 ) to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) using a Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories) in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mM glycine, 10% methanol, 0.02% SDS) at 4 °C, 900 mA, for 1.5 h. Membranes were stained with Ponceau Red to confirm equal loading, then blocked for 1.5 h in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) dissolved in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) plus Triton X-100 (TBST; 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100). Blocked membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant agitation in primary antibody solution (antibody at 1:1000 in TBST plus 1% BSA and 0.5% NaN 3 ). Membranes were rinsed in TBST and incubated 1.5 h at ambient temperature in secondary antibody solution (antibody at 1:100 000 in TBST plus 0.5% BSA). Membranes were then thoroughly washed in TBST and TBS, and treated for 1 min with ECL reagent (Amersham/GE Healthcare, Baie d’Urfé, QC). Membranes were exposed to blue-light sensitive ECL film (Amersham/GE Healthcare) for the appropriate duration for maximal signal without film saturation. Films were developed manually using D-19 developer and RapidFixer (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Developed films were scanned using a Hewlett Packard 6100 flatbed scanner (HP; Palo Alto, CA) with HP DeskScan II software. Densitometry analysis was then performed using Image 1.63 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Three replicates, each from a different cell passage, were performed for each condition. For each series of replicates, all samples were simultaneously subjected to electrophoresis and transferred to a single membrane. Data from the densitometric analysis of each replicate series were normalized to the vehicle control of that series. Normalized data from the three series were then pooled. 2.4 Mitochondrial respiration studies The effects of plant extracts on oxygen consumption of isolated mitochondria were assessed by oxygraphy with a Clark-type oxygen microelectrode system. Mitochondria were isolated from the liver of male Wistar rats weighing between 200 and 225 g. All animal manipulations were sanctioned by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Université de Montréal and respected the guidelines from the Canadian Council for the Care and Protection of Animals. Rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight) and underwent laparotomy. The portal vein was cannulated and the hepatic artery and the infrahepatic inferior vena cava were ligated. The liver was flushed with 100 ml of Krebs–Henseleit buffer (25 mM NaHCO 3 , 1.2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 2.1 mM CaCl 2 , 1.2 mM MgSO 4 ) at 22 °C prior to excision. Mitochondria were isolated from 2 g of liver by the method of Johnson and Lardy ( Johnson and Lardy, 1967 ). Briefly, tissue was homogenized on ice using a Teflon potter homogenizer in ice-cold Tris-sucrose buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EGTA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 15 000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet from this centrifugation was delicately washed once in the same buffer, centrifuged, washed once in EGTA-free buffer, and centrifuged again at 15 000 × g . The final pellet, containing viable mitochondria, was suspended in EGTA-free homogenizing buffer and kept on ice. Protein content of the homogenate was determined by Lowry's protein assay ( Lowry et al., 1951 ). O 2 consumption was measured at 25 °C in a Hansatech Oxygraph apparatus (Norfolk, UK) with a 1 ml reaction chamber, as previously described ( Ligeret et al., 2008; Morin et al., 2001 ). Briefly, 1 mg of mitochondrial protein was added to respiration buffer (5 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.2, 250 mM sucrose (ultra pure), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA, and 2 μM of the complex I inhibitor rotenone) at 25 °C in the reaction chamber, for a final volume of 990 μl. Mitochondrial respiration was initiated by the injection of 6 mM (final concentration) of the complex II substrate succinate, and the rate of basal oxygen consumption per mg mitochondrial protein (RBOC or state 4 respiration) was determined. One microliter of 1000× concentrated plant extract or 1 μl of DMSO was then injected and its effect on RBOC was assessed. Basal respiration was allowed to proceed for at least 30 additional seconds. Oxidative phosphorylation (state 3 respiration) was induced by the addition of 200 μM (final concentration) ADP and the rate of ADP-stimulated O 2 consumption per mg mitochondrial protein (RASOC) was determined. Extracts were tested in three different experimental sessions, with at least two replicate experiments per mitochondrial preparation. DMSO-vehicle control experiments were conducted at the beginning and end of each experimental session in order to establish the session-normal RBOC and RASOC and to ensure no loss in mitochondrial viability over the duration of the session, typically less than 4 h from the end of the isolation protocol. DMSO was confirmed to have no effect on the basal rate of O 2 consumption. The effect of each plant extract was evaluated as: (1) the increase in the RBOC (a measure of the magnitude of the uncoupling effect); (2) the decrease in functional capacity (FC) per mg protein (a measure of the magnitude of the uncoupling effect plus any additional inhibitory effect), where FC was defined as the difference of the RASOC (maximal functional rate of consumption) and the RBOC (rate of consumption driven by proton leak and not contributing to ATP synthesis). Calculations were as follows: the average FC per mg protein of the vehicle control experiments for a given session was calculated by subtracting the average RBOC from the average RASOC. For (1) above, the absolute increase in RBOC measured in a given experiment was expressed as a percentage of the average control FC for the session. For (2) above, the FC measured in a given experiment was expressed as a percentage of the average control FC for the session to give the % residual FC. The compound 2,4-dinitrophenol (Sigma–Aldrich) was used at 5 μM as a reference uncoupler, whereas oligomycin A (Sigma–Aldrich) was used at 0.5 μM as a reference ATPsynthase inhibitor. 2.5 Rate of acidification of extracellular medium A spectrophotometric assay of change in cell culture medium pH over time, quantitative between pH 7.2 and 6.4, was developed based on similar assays ( Schornack and Gillies, 2003; Yang and Balcarcel, 2003 ). The assay medium consisted of Dulbecco's PBS containing Phenol Red as a pH indicator and modified to contain a total of 2 mM phosphate (for approx. 20% of the buffering capacity of Dulbecco's original recipe) while keeping other ion concentrations within the physiological range of extracellular fluid. The composition of this modified Dulbecco's PBS (mD-PBS) was: 1.5 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 0.5 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 137 mM NaCl, 25 mM glucose, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , Phenol Red 0.1 mM (Sigma–Aldrich Phenol Red 0.5% solution), and deionized ultra-filtered water (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON). This formulation resulted in a pH of 7.1, which was adjusted to 7.20 at ambient temperature with NaOH immediately prior to the assay using an Accumet pH meter with calomel electrode (Fisher Scientific). Absorbance of 100 μl samples of medium transferred to 96-well plates (Sarstedt Inc., Montreal, QC) was measured at ambient temperature at 530 and 450 nm using a Wallac Victor 2 plate reader (Perkin-Elmer, St-Laurent, QC) and the ratio of abs 530/abs 450 was calculated. The relationship between pH and the log of this ratio was observed to be linear over the range of pH of 6.4–7.4, in agreement with a pKa of 6.9 for balanced-salt phosphate buffers. The following function was used to model the relationship between pH and absorbance over the pH range of 6.4–7.2: pH = 0.765 × ln(abs 530/abs 450) + 7.61 ( R 2 = 0.99). A titration experiment was performed to determine the buffering capacity of mD-PBS. This capacity was observed to be nearly linear between pH 6.2 and 7.2 and was calculated to be 1.075 mM equivalents per pH units between 6.3 and 7.1. Experiments were performed on 7-day differentiated C2C12 muscle cells and on 1-day post-confluent H4IIE liver cells grown in 12 well plates. On the day of the experiment, cells were gently rinsed twice with mD-PBS, and then allowed to equilibrate in exactly 1.0 ml of mD-PBS for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified air atmosphere. The assay was started by gently mixing pre-warmed 3× concentrated treatments in a 500 μl volume of mD-PBS to the 1.0 ml volume of mD-PBS already present, for a final volume of exactly 1.5 ml and treatments at their final working concentration. After the rapid addition of treatments to all the wells of a single plate, an initial 100 μl sample of medium, corresponding to time 0, was transferred to a microtiter plate for spectrophotometric analysis. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C in a humidified air atmosphere for the duration of the experiment. At times 20, 40, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min, plates were stirred and a 100 μl sample of medium was transferred to a microtiter plate for analysis. Calculations of rate of acidification and cumulative secretion of acid equivalents over time accounted for the decreasing experimental volume with each sampling. Because DMSO was observed to stimulate acidification, as noted by others ( Gerber et al., 1996 ), extracts were solubilized in 80% ethanol at 1000× their final concentration, for a final ethanol concentration of 0.08%. The addition of extracts or controls affected the pH of mD-PBS and therefore all treatments were adjusted to pH 7.2 separately immediately prior to the assay. Carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP; Sigma–Aldrich) solubilized in ethanol was used at 5 μM as a positive control. Results were expressed as cumulative secretion of acid equivalents (micromoles) for four to five replicates per condition per time point. 2.6 Cytosolic ATP assays Total cytosolic ATP was measured in cell lysates by luminescence using the ATPlite assay kit (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA), as per the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, C2C12 myotubes in 24-well plates or H4IIE hepatocytes in 96-well plates were treated in parallel for 1, 3, or 6 h with extract or DMSO. FCCP was used at 5 μM as a positive control. Cells were rinsed in PBS and lysed with supplied lysis buffer for 5 min with orbital shaking. Supplied substrate solution was then added and cells were shaken for 5 min. Plates were then covered for 10 min prior to measurement of luminescence in a plate reader. An ATP standard curve was prepared in parallel using the supplied ATP solution. Results were expressed as % ATP content of vehicle-treated wells. Three to four replicates per condition per time point were performed. 2.7 Statistical analysis Results are reported as mean ± SEM, with the number of replicates and number of independent experiments indicated. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with a Fisher post hoc test using StatView 5.0 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for the Macintosh platform. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Area under the curve calculations performed with Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) for the Macintosh platform. 3 Results 3.1 The AMPK pathway, but not the insulin receptor pathway, is activated in C2C12 muscle cells following an 18 h treatment with extracts In our earlier screening study ( Spoor et al., 2006 ), it was observed that deoxyglucose uptake in the absence of insulin stimulation (basal glucose uptake) was increased in C2C12 muscle cells by extracts of three of the eight species studied here following a 1 h treatment, and by seven of the eight species following an 18 h treatment. Metformin, used as a positive control at 400 μM, had little effect after 1 h but increased uptake by approximately 30% after 18 h. At rest, glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is mediated by GLUT1 glucose transporters constitutively expressed in the plasma membrane ( Klip and Marette, 1992 ). In response to stimulation of the insulin receptor signaling pathway or of the AMPK pathway, uptake can be transiently increased by the translocation of GLUT4 and GLUT1 transporters to the plasma membrane ( Abbud et al., 2000; Fujii et al., 2004; Krook et al., 2004 ), and possibly by the release of inhibition of the intrinsic activity of these transporters ( Michelle Furtado et al., 2003 ). Activation of AMPK can also upregulate transport capacity ( McGee and Hargreaves, 2006, 2008 ). To determine whether the effects of the active plant products were mediated through the insulin signaling pathway or through the AMPK pathway, C2C12 cells were treated for 1, 6, or 18 h with respective extracts and cell lysates were analyzed by western immunoblot for increased content of serine 473-phosphorylated Akt (protein kinase B), a well-recognized marker of stimulation of the insulin signaling pathway, and for increased content of threonine 172-phosphorylated AMPKalpha. The content of phospho-Akt ( Fig. 1 ) was not increased by more than 25% above the respective vehicle control levels by any extract following either a 1 or 18 h treatment, and content was even decreased relative to control by some conditions at the later time point. As a reference, stimulation with 1 nM of insulin for 15 min results in an increase in phospho-Akt content of approximately 150%, and 45 min later this content remains elevated by approximately 75% ( Benhaddou-Andaloussi et al., 2009 ). In contrast to the small fluctuations in content of phospho-Akt, phospho-AMPK content ( Fig. 2 ) underwent more important increases. Threonine 172-phosphorylated AMPKalpha content was increased by all eight extracts at the end of the 1 h treatment by 60–170% above vehicle control levels. At the end of the 6 h treatment, content remained elevated by 50% or more by six extracts, and in four cases, content was actually higher at 6 h than at 1 h. Treatment with the Sarracenia purpurea extract was notable in that it resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in phospho-AMPK content at this time point, an effect of similar magnitude as that of the AICAR positive control applied for 30 min. At the end of the 18 h treatment, phospho-AMPK contents were in all conditions lower than at the 6 h time point. However, in cells treated with Sarracenia purpurea , Sorbus decora , or Alnus incana extracts, phospho-AMPK remained 2-fold or more above the level of the vehicle control at the 18 h mark. The same samples were also analyzed for serine 79-phosphorylated ACC content ( Fig. 3 ), a marker of activation of the AMPK pathway. The same six extracts observed to increase phospho-AMPK content at all measured time points produced a similar pattern of increase in phospho-ACC content. In keeping with its downstream position relative to AMPK, ACC phosphorylation was observed to be generally more sustained than AMPK activation; in cells treated with Sarracenia purpurea , Sorbus decora , Alnus incana , or Rhododendron groenlandicum extracts, contents measured at 18 h were similar to or even greater than those measured at 6 h. 3.2 A relationship between increased phospho-AMPK content and glucose uptake Seven of the eight species studied here have previously been shown to increase glucose uptake in muscle cells in the absence of insulin stimulation following an 18 h treatment ( Spoor et al., 2006 ). The area under the curve of phospho-AMPK content over 18 h, as defined by contents measured here at 1, 6, and 18 h (above), was observed to be well correlated ( R 2 = 0.86) to the enhancement of basal glucose uptake previously reported ( Fig. 4 ). 3.3 Extracts instantaneously disrupt function of isolated mitochondria AMPK is highly sensitive to metabolic stress and perturbations of energy homeostasis. As many plant defensive metabolites exert disruptive effects on well-conserved energy transduction pathways ( Polya, 2003 ), we next addressed the hypothesis that the extracts found to activate the AMPK pathway would also disrupt mitochondrial function. Succinate-supported rates of basal and ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption were measured in isolated rat liver mitochondria treated with either vehicle or with respective plant extracts at the same concentration used to induce glucose uptake and stimulation of AMPK. An increase in RBOC reflects an uncoupler-type disruption of mitochondrial function, as can be induced with the reference compound 2,4-dinitrophenol ( Fig. 5 A ). A decrease in RASOC, occurring in the absence of any change in RBOC, typically reflects an inhibition of ATP synthase, as can be induced with the reference compound oligomycin A ( Fig. 5 A). Concurrent uncoupling and inhibition of ATP synthase can occur, especially when testing complex mixtures possibly containing multiple active principles. However, concurrent effects on RBOC and RASOC can also indicate other types of disruption, such as an inhibition of substrate transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Of the eight plant products tested here, six induced a concurrent increase in RBOC and decrease in RASOC, whereas one, the Rhododendron groenlandicum extract, affected RASOC only, and one, the Picea mariana extract, had no effect on mitochondrial function. The seven products found to affect mitochondrial function were therefore the same seven previously observed to enhance glucose uptake ( Spoor et al., 2006 ). These disruptions, whether concurrent and therefore cumulative, or of a single type, resulted in reductions in mitochondrial capacity for ATP synthesis ranging from 11% to 67% ( Table 1 ). All disruptions of mitochondrial function observed were instantaneous. Representative oxygen consumption tracings are shown for the extract of Rhododendron groenlandicum ( Fig. 5 B) affecting only RASOC, and for the extract of Abies balsamea ( Fig. 5 C), the product that induced the greatest disruptions (23% and 46% reductions in mitochondrial capacity by uncoupling and inhibitory effects, respectively). 3.4 Extracts stimulate the rate of acidification of the cell culture medium When mitochondrial capacity for ATP synthesis is reduced to the point where it can no longer meet the energy needs of the cell, dependence on anaerobic glycolysis for energy production is increased. By measuring flux through glycolysis, it is therefore possible to obtain information concerning the degree of metabolic stress induced by the plant products as well as information about their rapidity and duration of action. Furthermore, these experiments allow for the comparison of effects across different cell types. As lactic acid is the end product of anaerobic glycolysis, flux through this pathway was measured as the rate of acidification of cell culture medium. Extracts were applied to cells for 4 h, over which time the medium was periodically sampled and pH determined spectrophotometrically using Phenol Red as indicator. Results were expressed in the form of cumulative secretion of acid equivalents over time ( Fig. 6 ). All extracts were observed to increase the rate of acidification by 2–3-fold over the first 20 min of the assay in C2C12 cells. However, beyond this time, effects varied greatly between the different extracts. A sustained increase in the rate of acidification over the 4 h experimental period was produced only by the Larix laricina and Abies balsamea extracts, the two extracts that most severely disrupted function in isolated mitochondria. The Alnus incana extract produced the smallest effect, which lasted no longer than 20 min. The Picea mariana extract, despite having no observable effect in isolated liver mitochondria, produced the largest increase in rate of acidification; however, this increase was not sustained beyond the first hour. The Sorbus decora , the Rhododendron groenlandicum , and the Sarracenia purpurea extracts produced short-lived effects. Interestingly, the latter two demonstrated a tendency to depress anaerobic metabolism below the vehicle control rate of acidification after the first hour of treatment. In H4IIE hepatocytes, slightly different effects were observed. Notably, the Picea mariana extract had no effect in this cell line. Also, the magnitude of effect of the Abies balsamea was much greater in hepatocytes than muscle cells, surpassing the effect of the positive control FCCP. Finally, in some instances, rate of acidification was observed to be paradoxically depressed rather than stimulated. 3.5 Extracts induce a depression of cytosolic ATP content Similarly to the acidification assay above, the concentration of cytosolic ATP was assessed in order to gain insight into magnitude, rapidity of onset, and duration of the metabolic stress induced by the plant extracts in whole cells. In C2C12 cells, all species, with the exception of Rhododendron groenlandicum , were observed to induce a depression of cytosolic ATP content 1 h into the treatment ( Fig. 7 ). In the case of the Larix laricina and Abies balsamea extracts, this depression was sustained over the 6 h experimental period, concordant with their sustained increase in anaerobic metabolism observed in the acidification assay. The effect of the Sorbus decora extract was the shortest lived. The effects of other extracts were normalized by the 6 h time point. The Rhododendron groenlandicum and Sorbus decora extracts tended to induce supranormal ATP levels, possibly due to the overcompensation of ATP synthesis in response to metabolic stress and activation of AMPK. Supranormal ATP content by these extracts coincided with a tendency for inhibition of Akt activity ( Fig. 1 ). As in the acidification assay, cell-type differences were observed. Notably, the magnitude of effect of the extracts was smaller in H4IIE hepatocytes; only the Larix laricina extract induced a depression between 1 and 6 h ( Fig. 7 ). However, the overcompensation phenomenon described above was observed to be induced by five extracts as well as by the FCCP positive control. The two most important overcompensations, those induced by the Sarracenia purpurea and Sorbus decora extracts, concord with the observed depression of anaerobic metabolism induced by these products ( Fig. 6 ), which may indicate allosteric inhibition of glycolysis by surplus ATP. 4 Discussion Medicinal plant products with anti-hyperglycemic activity are common in the traditional medicine of cultures throughout the world, and the efficacy of many has been rigorously studied ( Haddad et al., 2006; Marles and Farnsworth, 1995 ). The cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of these, however, have generally not been elucidated. The present study focuses on plant products selected from the pharmacopeia of an aboriginal Canadian population, the Cree of Iiyiyiu Istchii, and was undertaken for further evaluation of these products as promising and culturally adapted treatment options for diabetes care in susceptible aboriginal populations. Specifically, the present study addressed the mechanism of action through which these products enhance the rate of basal glucose uptake in a model skeletal muscle cell line, an activity first observed in our recent screening study of the antidiabetic potential of these products ( Spoor et al., 2006 ). Our results demonstrate that the selected medicinal plant products act through a common mechanism involving the AMPK signaling pathway, rather than through the insulin receptor pathway, to increase basal glucose uptake in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells following 18 h of treatment. Indeed, whereas no significant increases in the content of phosphorylated Akt were observed throughout the 18 h period, phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC were increased up to 2.5- and 3.5-fold, respectively. The AMPK pathway converges with the insulin receptor pathway at the level of AS160 and in this way can induce the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the sarcolemma and promote an increase in the rate of uptake ( Cartee and Wojtaszewski, 2007; Thong et al., 2007 ). Direct effects of the AMPK pathway on the intrinsic activity of constitutively expressed GLUT1 transporters and of GLUT4 transporters have also been reported ( Michelle Furtado et al., 2003 ). However, increase in the expression of glucose transporters and of other effectors of the insulin receptor pathway that are mediated by AMPK signaling ( McGee and Hargreaves, 2008 ) likely play a more important role in the long-lasting effects of the products studied herein. This was supported by the observation that some plant products enhanced basal glucose uptake to levels surpassing the maximal acute stimulatory effect of insulin ( Spoor et al., 2006 ). This is now also supported by an excellent correlation between the enhancement of glucose uptake after the 18 h treatment and the activation of AMPK over the entire treatment period ( Fig. 5 ). Arguments against residual acute stimulation of uptake at 18 h, such as the observation that the effect of insulin applied acutely was additive to the effect induced by 18 h treatment with plant products ( Spoor et al., 2006 ), now also include the finding that AMPK activation was either declining or had returned to control levels at the 18 h time point. This activation of the AMPK pathway can be explained by the induction of a metabolic stress through a mild and transient disruption of mitochondrial energy transduction ( Hayashi et al., 2000 ). Indeed, all seven plant products previously shown to stimulate glucose uptake were here found to induce in isolated mitochondria an inhibitory-type disruption of oxidative phosphorylation or a combination of inhibition and uncoupling-type disruptions. Metabolic stress was confirmed in intact cells as increased flux through anaerobic glycolysis and depression of cytosolic ATP concentrations. Both inhibitory and uncoupling effects additively contribute to a reduction of mitochondrial capacity. When capacity is no longer sufficient to meet energy demand, energy homeostasis is disturbed and activation of AMPK then results from the simultaneous drop in ATP concentration and rise in AMP concentration ( Winder and Thomson, 2007 ). In the face of such metabolic stress, the function of AMPK is to restore energy homeostasis as well as to protect the cell against future metabolic stress. This is accomplished by acutely increasing glucose and fat uptake to support a coordinated stimulation of carbohydrate and lipid oxidation, while at the same time transiently inhibiting energy-consuming synthetic processes ( Winder and Thomson, 2007 ). The adaptive effects of AMPK include an increase in mitochondrial capacity through mitochondrial biogenesis and an increase in substrate uptake capacity ( McGee and Hargreaves, 2008; Reznick and Shulman, 2006; Winder, 2001 ). Induction of metabolic stress through disruptions of mitochondrial function has long been known to produce cytoprotective effects. For example, the classical uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol has been shown to increase glucose uptake in muscle cells ( Bashan et al., 1993 ), and sodium azide, a cytochrome oxidase inhibitor, has been shown to rapidly upregulate GLUT1 expression by several folds in liver cells ( Behrooz and Ismail-Beigi, 1997; Shetty et al., 1993 ). The effects of the commonly prescribed hypoglycemic drug Metformin are believed to be mediated similarly through inhibition of complex I of the electron transport chain ( El-Mir et al., 2000; Owen et al., 2000 ) and subsequent activation of AMPK ( Hayashi et al., 2000 ). It is remarkable that products from such a wide variety of plant species, as are represented here, share a common mechanism of action. However, disruption of energy transduction and the resulting indirect activation of AMPK represent a simple mechanism requiring less molecular specificity than the activation of the insulin receptor signaling pathway or even than the inhibition of negative regulators of this pathway. Therefore, it is possible that the metabolic stress mechanism is widespread and may explain the antidiabetic activity of traditional medicines from various cultures. This mechanism is also in accordance with the defensive role of many plant secondary metabolites, evolved for fungicidal, bactericidal, and insecticidal activities, all mediated by the targeting of highly conserved energy transduction pathways ( Polya, 2003 ). Indeed, several plant compounds, including many flavonoids, are known disruptors of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, acting either as uncouplers or as inhibitors ( Polya, 2003 ). Targeting mitochondrial energy transduction is inherently dangerous; increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism as a compensation for compromised mitochondrial capacity results in an increase in the rate of release of hydrogen ions, which can lead to systemic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis is indeed the primary danger associated with the use of biguanides and represents a potential complication that needs to be considered in the case of the plant products tested herein. This danger can clearly be minimized if the metabolic stress is short-lived. The results obtained in our study on the rate of acidification and on cytosolic ATP content suggest that the effects of the plant products are indeed in most cases short-lived and of low magnitude, aerobic capacity generally being restored after 30–60 min. Such effects would be expected with rapidly metabolized products and future studies, notably on active principles, will need to address this point. Our results highlight the importance of duration of AMPK activation for maximizing the enhancement of glucose uptake; the products that were notable in their sustained activation of this pathway, the extracts of Sarracenia purpurea and Sorbus decora , were also the most efficacious for increasing uptake. A less intuitive observation, however, is that there appears to be an optimal pattern of metabolic stress for enhancing muscle glucose uptake (and perhaps for maximizing other insulin-like effects of AMPK such as the inhibition of hepatic glucose output) and that sustained metabolic stress may actually be counterproductive. Indeed, the products that induced the most prolonged stress, as gauged by the depression of ATP concentration and increased flux through anaerobic glycolysis, were not the most efficacious for activating AMPK or enhancing uptake. On the other hand, the extracts of Sarracenia purpurea and of Sorbus decora produced a paradoxical combination of sustained activation of the AMPK pathway and short-lived metabolic stress. This observation therefore suggests the possibility that the potential for lactic acidosis can be uncoupled from AMPK-stimulating activity. This augers well for efforts aimed at identifying better alternatives to Metformin and the biguanides. We also observed that depression of ATP concentration was in several cases followed by a compensatory overshoot phenomenon. This provides further evidence that, for the most part, the extracts induce a sudden but short-lived metabolic stress. As an overcompensation of ATP synthesis can be explained by an AMPK-triggered stimulation of lipid and carbohydrate oxidation that is sustained several hours after the restoration of homeostasis, the concordance of these overshoots with sustained ACC phosphorylation is further support of a mismatch between the kinetics of metabolic stress and those of AMPK activation. It should be noted that ATP overcompensation and/or sustained ACC phosphorylation induced by the Rhododendron groenlandicum , Sorbus decora , and Sarracenia purpurea extracts also coincided with depressed glycolytic flux and inhibition of the insulin signaling pathway, expected effects in the face of energy surfeit. Finally, it is noteworthy that cell-type specific effects were observed in the acidification and cytosolic ATP assays. A striking example was that of the Picea mariana extract which had no effect on acidification in liver cells, concordant with its absence of effect on isolated liver mitochondria, and yet produced the highest measured rate of acidification in muscle cells. Such cell-type specificities, possibly due to molecular differences in the electron transport chain, support the hypothesis that it is possible to target AMPK-mediated effects only in some tissues while sparing others. This is highly desirable from a therapeutic point of view since in pancreatic beta cells, the activation of AMPK can decrease insulin secretion ( da Silva Xavier et al., 2003 ), while in hypothalamic cells, it can trigger hunger signaling ( Kola, 2008 ). In our previous screening study ( Spoor et al., 2006 ), it was observed that the Larix laricina and Sorbus decora extracts had no effect on glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and only the Abies balsamea , Larix laricina , Rhododendron groenlandicum , and Sarracenia purpurea extracts inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in β cells. In conclusion, the medicinal plant species studied herein exert their activity through a common mechanism similar to that of Metformin, involving the activation of AMPK secondary to metabolic stress induced by the disruption of mitochondrial energy transduction. Due to its simplicity, this mechanism is likely to apply to other antidiabetic plant products used elsewhere in the world. The active products studied herein may be useful against insulin resistance and metabolic diseases. Testing for anti-hyperglycemic activity in animal models is currently underway, as is the isolation and identification of the active constituents of these products. The detailed profile of biological activity obtained in this study will help inform the choice of candidate products for integration into the diabetes care of Canadian aboriginal populations.

The origin of these depressions remains hypothetical. Some of these depressions are filled with peat and colonized by acid peat bog vegetation. A 440 cm deep peat core from the Romersberg forest was analysed for pollen and radiocarbon dated. Sediment and palynological records begin during the 8(th) century in forested context marked by a direct anthropogenic impact corresponding to Carolingian clearance. Aquatic taxa (Potamogeton, Nymphaea) colonized the structure which can be compared to a small pond bordered by Alnus and Salix. The main period of anthropogenic impact occurs during the 12(th) century linked with salt factory establishment in Dieuze town which used a part of the Romersberg forest for wood supply. Anthropogenic impact increases during the 14(th) century with salt industry development. Peat formation begins during this period along with acid vegetation development. In the 15(th) century, Romersberg forest becomes an exclusive forestry supply area for rock salt industry with short tree exploitation cycle. During the industrial revolution, salt industry substitute wood by coal as fuel and Romersberg forest exploitation switch from short exploitation cycle to actual forestry exploitation system.",,

These deposits of the Upper Cretaceous to Lower Paleogene Muwaqqar Chalk-Marl Formation form a huge north-southward elongated oil shale basin in Central Jordan, with resources over 55 billion tons. JOSE has drilled a regular grid of boreholes with a full coring of the up to 90 m thick OS seam and its lower and upper contact layers. Visually, the OS unit is a rather homogenous dark-colored (grey, black, brownish grey) succession of finely bedded (laminated) kerogen-bearing carbonate rocks that has been in earlier papers described as a uniform lithological unit. The aim of the geological and lithological studies of the JOSE exploration area was (i) to investigate the vertical variation of OS composition and, if present, to define layers within the OS unit, and (ii) to identify lithological varieties and chemical composition of OS present in different layers. On the basis of field evidence, downhole gamma-logging, chemical analyses and other criteria, an original detailed scheme of the layered structure of oil shale and barren rocks was introduced. A total of eight OS layers (indexed as A, B1, B2, C, D, E1, E2, E3) and at least four barren dolomitic limestone interlayers were distinguished. The present publication is dedicated to the chemical study of the layers and the total OS seam. A representative gapless collection of 632 conventional core samples from 12 cores serves as the base for the comparative study of the layers. Two main (SiO2, CaO) and two subordinate chemical (Al2O3 and P2O5) components of the mineral matter (MM), and loss on ignition (LOI 500 degrees C) approximately reflecting the content of organic matter (OM), are the basic variables discussed. Contents of SiO2 and CaO always show negative correlation, whereas local enrichment with Al2O3 and P2O5 occurs in certain interbeds. OM content in samples has no strong correlation with mineral matter abundances. The eight distinguished OS layers comprise both those strongly enriched in CaO, or oppositely in SiO2. The layers differ in rate of internal heterogeneity reflected in variation of standard deviation values. With rare exceptions, the barren limestone interlayers are dolomitized, strongly enriched with MgO and depleted of CaO.

Seeds of two sizes (3.5-4 mm and 1.5-2 mm) were planted during three seasons: early summer, early autumn, and late autumn. The experimental period was 6 mo. Mortalities of C. gigas at culture phase nursery lantern-nets, intermediate lantern-nets, and final lantern-nets were recorded. The reproductive cycle of the oysters grown from 3.5 to 4 mm seeds planted in each season was closely monitored (bimonthly) during the experimental period. In addition, seawater parameters [temperature (daily) and salinity (weekly)] were monitored throughout the experimental period. Results of this study demonstrated that the planting season affected C. gigas mortality after the nursery phase. Lower cumulative mortality was observed for 3.5-4 mm seeds than for 1.5-2 mm seeds when the seeds were planted in early (MarL: 0.29 +/- 0.02) and late (JunL: 0.22 +/- 0.10) autumn, after 6 mo of culture.

In contrast, research into the role of paradigm in derivation has been programmatic as well as fragmentary. In this paper I investigate the extent to which patterns of relationships among derived words constitute a derivational paradigm. A more comprehensive and precise characterization of derivational paradigm is provided based on a unified treatment of inflection and derivation. Previous diachronic-oriented research (van Marle, 1984; Pounder, 2000) is complemented by a dynamic model I propose for representing the role of derivational paradigms in synchronic word-formation. The proposed model captures local vs. non-local derivational associations as identified via what I refer to as the Paradigmatic Derivate Generalization (PDG). Using the model and a generalized notion of paradigm derived from the rule-patterns of Bochner (1993), a variety of derivational processes in English, French, Tigre and Lithuanian are analyzed to identify the paradigmatic relationships upon which word formation in those languages is dependent. The suitability of the model for implementation using word-formation rules is also demonstrated through an analysis of a fragment of the Lithuanian data using a novel adaptation of Paradigm Function Morphology (Stump, 2001). While inflectional and derivational paradigms are not parallel in function and may differ in their range of applicability, they do share many of the same characteristics. Furthermore, these findings indicate that generalizing the notion of paradigm as a theoretical construct to derivational word formation is supported by cross-linguistic evidence.

Sassaroli'}]","New biostratigraphic data are provided from the Marchean Apennines (Marconessa quarry, near Cingoli, Macerata, Italy) where a lower Jurassic outcrop yielded a remakable Toarcian ammonite assemblage, very rich in early Hildoceratinae (Ammonitina). The site is historically meaningful, because in the past two centuries Italian palaeontologists have figured ammonoid specimens from ""Marconessa "". Here, the nodular limestone and grey marl of the Bugarone Formation have recorded a great amount of well preserved Toarcian inner moulds of ammonoids sometimes large sized. From the lower and middle Toarcian layers of the Marconessa quarry sections we collected several ammonite genera, such as Hildaites, Orthildaites, Hildoceras, Harpoceras, Taffertia, Rakusites, Martanites, Praemercaticeras, Mercaticeras, Leukadiella, Frechiella, Phymatoceras, Rarenodia, Praepolyplectus, Polyplectus, Orthodactylites, Mesodactylites, Nodicoeloceras, very rare Dactylioceras and Nejdia, Lytoceras, Calliphylloceras, Phylloceras. We establish herein a new genus Cingolites, to which we ascribe three new species (C. clavatus, C. picenus and C. spiralis) and an already established species (C. stefaniniij, which was previously assigned by Merla (1932) to the genus Mercaticeras. To the present-day the genus Cingolites seems to have a Mediterranean Tethys dispersal, mainly in the Apennines, where it occurs with other endemic Hildoceratinae fauna. These ammonite assemblages found in our Apennines sections seem to show a certain amount of provincialism that affected some Hildoceratinae lineages of the lower Toarcian. RIASSUNTO [Cingolites, nuovo genere di Hildoceratinae (Ammonitina) del Toarciano inferiore dell'Appennino Marchigiano (Cingoli, Macerata, Italia)] Questo lavoro tratta un nuovo genere di ammoniti Hildoceratinae del Toarciano inferiore raccolti con criterio stratigrafico nella Cava della Marconessa di Cingoli (Macerata). 1 numerosi fossili di ammoniti e altri molluschi collezionati in questa località sono stati oggetto di interesse da parte dei paleontologi italiani fin dalla fine dell'Ottocento. Negli anni più recenti l'attività estrattiva, condotta dalla ditta SIELPA, ha denudalo un vasto fronte di cava in cui affiora la successione giurassica ridotta, che va dal Calcare Massiccio (SinemurianoHettangiano) al Calcare Maiolica del Cretaceo. Nelle sezioni della Marconessa di Cingoli il Toarciano si presenta in facies grigia (calcare nodulare e marne), litologicamente equivalente ai coevi calcari nodulari rossi del Rosso Ammonitico Umbro-Marchigiano. Dai livelli fossiliferi del fronte di cava, così come dalla notevole quantità di detriti rimossa dall'attività estrattiva, è stata raccolta una grande quantità di esemplari di ammoniti del Toarciano, spesso ottimamente conservati e anche di grandi dimensioni. Negli orizzonti del Toarciano inferiore delle zone a Serpentinum/Levisoni e della base della Zona a Bifrons (secondo la vigente zonazione standard delle paleoprovincie della Tetide mediterranea e sub-mediterranea) abbiamo collezionato un 'interessante associazione faunistica, notevole per quantità di esemplari, il loro ottimo stato di conservazione e il numero di taxa rappresentati. Oltre al nuovo genere Cingolites oggetto del presente lavoro, abbiamo collezionato forme appartenenti ai generi più tipici del Toarciano inferiore: Hildaites, Orthildaites e Hildoceras, con nuovi taxa ancora in studio, e inoltre Harpoceras, Taffertia, Neotaffertia, Martanites, Praepolyplectus, Polyplectus, Phymatoceras, Mercaticeras, Leukadiella, Frechiella, Rarenodia, Rakusites, Orthodactylites, Mesodactylites, Nodicoeloceras, Lytoceras, Calliphylloceras, Phylloceras, e infine anche Nejdia e Dactylioceras (molto rari). Al nuovo genere Cingolites attribuiamo 3 nuove specie (C. clavatus, C. picenus e C. spiralis) e una specie già nota (C stefaninii), ma inclusa da Merla (1932) nel genere Mercaticeras. Fra queste forme, alcune sembrano endemiche del bacino ToscoUmbro-Marchigiano, altre forme sembrano distribuite anche in altri bacini della Tetide mediterranea. Allo stato attuale della ricerca il genere Cingolites sembra essere distribuito principalmente nell'Appennino ed essere associato ad altre forme di Hildoceratinae ancora inedite, che sembrano essere confinate nella Tetide mediterranea. Il ritrovamento di queste forme, il cui resoconto dettagliato richiede ulteriori pubblicazioni, sembrerebbe quindi comprovare l'esistenza di un certo grado di provincialismo nella fauna ammonitica del Toarciano inferiore.",,

However, soil testing using the Olsen method has shown that while soil P in some catchment areas of the Province is low, surface waters within these catchments are, nonetheless, every bit as eutrophic as other local catchments where soil P is high. Soil P measurements on over 6000 samples from Northern Ireland soils (A horizon only) have indicated that Olsen-P values of improved grassland on most parent materials are linearly related to animal intensification. Exceptions are soils derived from peat, marl and basalt. For each of the latter soils, the measured Olsen-P was shown to be around 10 mg L-1 lower than expected for farms with similar intensification on other parent materials. In particular, the mean Olsen-P values of samples from basaltic soils under grass with total Fe above 62 g kg(-l) and total Mg above 16 g kg(-1) were significantly lower than those from basaltic soils with low total Fe (<37 g kg(-1)) and total Mg (<8 g kg(-1)). As a result of the depressed Olsen-P value, excessive quantities of P may be applied to these soils to maintain a recommended soil P index thereby enhancing the potential for nutrient enrichment of adjacent surface waters. In such cases, coworkers have shown that acid ammonium oxalate may be a better extractant than bicarbonate as an indicator of plant-available P.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/92/04/17/920417276ED07252D815B86E556A5EAB.pdf

Minor scale microcycles are found within the parasequences which probably represent the record of sudden high energy events alternating with quiet hemipelagic or pelagic sedimentation. Organic petrographic and geochemical study of different marly samples throughout the sections did not show significant compositional differences. There are three laterally equivalent intervals with higher TOC and total sulphur contents, higher concentration of aromatic compounds and heterocompounds, higher Prn-C17 and Phyn-C18 ratios, and lower PrPhy ratio and CPI values. These intervals correspond to the end of the jamesoni zone, the boundary of the ibex and davoei zones and especially the lower part of the margaritatus zone. The uniformity of petrographic and qualitative chemical composition throughout the sections indicates that the nature of the organic matter supply did not change significantly during sedimentation, implying that changes in the conditions of preservation were likely responsible for the formation of the organic-rich intervals. Lower dissolved oxygen conditions probably produced a higher preservation of both organic carbon and aromatic and hetero-compounds, as indicated by the fluorescence properties and the infrared spectra of the extracts.",,

Since Wallace drew his line, the Australasian region has been recognised as a pivotal place on the earth's surface, where across a sharp gradient we step from one world to another. In the biological realm, Asian elephants, tigers and weaver birds are juxtaposed to Australian cockatoos, giant goannas and marsupials across a narrow gap of deep water running between Borneo and Sulawesi and continuing between Bali and Lombok (van Oosterzee, 1997). These faunal changes reflect a geological history along the border zone between the great southern continent of Gondwana, the ancient Tethyan ocean and an evolving Asian landmass. The legacy of this history for petroleum exploration is a complex and diverse region where a multitude of petroleum systems, ranging in age from the Cambrian to the Neogene, can be exploited (Bradshaw et al., 1997). Hydrocarbons have been generated from marine, lacustrine, deltaic and coal swamp facies; and both carbonate and siliciclastic source rocks occur. The most prolific petroleum systems are the product of organic-rich rocks accumulated in tropical environments, not unlike the present day regime. In the Cambrian-Ordovician a shallow carbonate platform stretched through central and northern Australia, across the southern half of what is now the island of New Guinea, and onto the continental blocks that later amalgamated to form China and south-east Asia (Metcalfe, 1997). Carbon-rich oil prone source rocks were deposited in these warm shallow waters of the palaeo-tropics. Today there is oil production from Ordovician reservoirs at the opposite ends of this now dismembered shallow seaway in central Australia (Mereenie field, Amadeus Basin) and in the Tarim Basin of western China. Significant oil shows derived from Cambrian source rocks are recorded from the Arafura Basin (Bradshaw et al., 1990; Edwards et al., 1997) and the prospective zone for this petroleum system extends across the stable platform from northern Australia into eastern Indonesia (Fig. 1).

NC = North China, SC = South China, T = Tarim, I = Indochina, QI = Qiangtang, L = Lhasa, S = Sibumasu, MB = West Burma, GI = Greater India. In the late Devonian, the Palaeo-Tethys ocean opened separating the South China, Tarim, Indochina and North China blocks from Gondwana (Metcalfe, 1997). The Caledonia Orogeny in China and the Alice Springs Orogeny in Australia signal these events; and from this time onwards the geological histories of Australia and China diverged dramatically. Australia as part of Gondwana, shifted southwards into polar regions, and by the Late Carboniferous-earliest Permian was partially covered by an ice sheet.

Onshore Permian coal basins are important suppliers of domestic gas in Australia (Bowen and Cooper basins) and undeveloped Permian gas accumulations also occur offshore in the Petrel Sub-basin, of the Bonaparte Basin. There is a close similarity of the Late Permian sedimentary sequences from northern Australia and Irian Jaya. The geological and geochemical evidence (Perkins & Livsey, 1993; Bradshaw et al., 1997) indicates that the coals and associated shales of the Permian Ainim Formation are the likely source of the giant gas fields (Wiriagar, Vorwata) in the Bird's Head. By the Triassic, the Meso-Tethys had opened as the Cimmerian continent rifted off from the Gondwanan core (Metcalfe, 1997). The Mesozoic carbonate belt running along the northern shores of Tethys is well known from the Austrian Alps to the Middle East, and evidence has accumulated in recent years of a similar zone mirrored on the southern shores of Tethys. ODP drilling unexpectedly recovered Rhaetian reefal carbonates from the northern margin of Australia's Exmouth Plateau (Exon et al., 1991). There is also some geochemical evidence to suggest that the oils sourced from Mesozoic carbonate facies seen in Seram, Buton, Buru and Timor may also extend to the outer Bonaparte and Browse basins (Edwards et al., in press) and to the Carnarvon Basin (George, et al., 1998). A picture is emerging of another petroleum system developed out beyond the typical Westralian system of the North West Shelf. This new system is characterised by hydrocarbons sourced from deep water marls rather than marine shales with a significant higher plant input as found in the inboard failed rifts (Bradshaw et al., 1994). By the Cretaceous, the last of the continental fragments had rifted from Australia's north-west margin, and the Indian Ocean opened as the major blocks of Gondwana separated. Cretaceous petroleum systems are now proven in the Browse and Bonaparte basins (Blevin et al 1998; Preston & Edwards, 2000), but in the global context the Australasian region is very under-represented in oil reserves derived from mid Cretaceous (Aptian-Turonian) source rocks (Klemme & Ulmishek, 1991). This gap in the distribution may be filled with further finds on the North West Shelf and into eastern Indonesia, as well as along Australia's southern margin (Totterdell et al., 2000). The region has had a dramatic Cainozoic tectonic history as the Australian, Pacific and Asian plates have collided, subducted, buckled, fragmented and sheared (Hall, 1999) producing a host of young petroliferous basins. Cainozoic petroleum systems are dominant in Indonesia, ranging from Eocene lake basins in Sumatra, deltaic complexes in Kalimantan to Miocene carbonates in the Salawati Basin of the Bird's Head (ten Haven & Schiefelbein, 1995). In contrast, on the old Gondwanan core of Australia most known hydrocarbons are derived from Mesozoic and Palaeozoic sources. The one significant exception being the Gippsland Basin in southeastern Australia where the Late Cretaceous to Eocene lower delta plain deposits of the Latrobe Group are the accepted source rock. However, Eocene oil shales occur onshore in Queensland in small lake basins close to the current coastline where a pilot plant has been established to retort oil from the crushed shale. Perhaps these organic-rich facies may also occur offshore in basins where it may be mature for oil generation.",,

Late Ediacaran/Early Paleozoic aged Camlica metamorphics which crop out with a tectonic uplift in a narrow area in northwest of Gokceada are the oldest rocks of the island. Early Eocene aged Karaagac Formation which is formed by submarine fan deposits unconformably overlies Camlica metamorphics. As for the Dagicitepe volcanic member which is formed by rhyolitic lavas, tuff and tuffites emplaced into Karaagac Formation cutting Camlica metamorphics is the oldest volcanic unit of the study area. On Karaagac Formation, Koyunbaba Formation has unconformably been deposited which consists of Middle Eocene shallow marine sediments. Then it has conformably been overlain by Sogucak Formation which consists of SE-NW ex- tending reefal limestone. Middle-Upper Eocene aged Ceylan Formation which conformably overlies the Sogucak Formation and the early Oligocene aged Mezardere Formation which conformably overlies Ceylan Formation have been deposited due to turbiditic currents in deep marine environment. Late Eocene(?) – Oligocene aged subvolcanics which cut Me- sozoic and Eocene units and emplaced into Eocene aged sedimentary units in the form of crypto dome and dome form the recent rigid topography of the study area and are the second magmatic phase called the “Gokceada Domes”. Diorite-monzonites porphyry which crys- tallized in lower zones of subvolcanics on the other hand constitutes Mutludere intrusion. In eastern and southern parts of Gokceada, Late Oligocene Gokceada ignimbrites are located which are observed in the form of pumice flows on Mezardere Formation.

The micro-conglomerates mark erosion surfaces. Microprobe and backscatter SEM analysis of the dolomite rhombs show an early diagenetic, complex-zoned, idiomorphic overgrowth, with Mn-rich zones, possibly formed by hot fluids related to cooling melt sheet in the crater.

Shocked quartz occurs in the crossbedded unit but is absent in the clay layer. The basal Paleocene marls are strongly dissolved and do not contain a basal Paleocene fauna. The presence of a hardground, the lack of siderophile elements, shocked quartz, or Ni-rich spinels in the clay layer, and the absence of basal Paleocene biozones P0 and Pa all suggest that the top of the ejecta sequence and a significant part of the lower Paleocene is missing.

Differential subsidence of the blocks controlled the development of a crestal residual carbonate platform (Arenillas), which was surrounded by deeper water on both sides.

The use of correlation panels, sedimentary logs, biostratigraphy and mapping revealed that all of the channel elements are found within much larger features. One series of channels from the southern margin of the basin lie, within an entrenched deep-water slope channel complex, over 3 km wide, called the Nohut Channel Complex. This channel complex has three main fill packages. The lower package is a highly disturbed, slumped interval that directly overlies the erosional base of the main channel complex. The slumped interval is interpreted as a series of mass transport complexes, derived from shallow marine or upper slope facies. The second package comprises a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic series, principally of interbedded calcarenites, marls and mudstones. Locally, outer shelf/upper slope offset-stacked channels with calcarenite fills occur. The upper package comprises isolated conglomerate and sandstone filled deep-water channels that are incised into laterally extensive depositional lobes. The coarse-grained fills are dominated by tabular beds. The lobes are comprised of fine-medium grained sandstones. Some of these channels have low aspect ratios (25:1), and are asymmetric in cross-section, suggesting sinuosity. The upper part of this fill package is either incised into by pro-fan delta conglomerate filled channels, or down-lapped onto by shelfal calcarenites. A separate series of channels come from the northern margin of the basin, but are interpreted to have developed on an open, deep-water slope or ramp, rather than as an entrenched channel complex. These channels occur in two main sets, collectively referred to as the Aydinlar Channel Complexes. The lower set is characterized by syn-sedimentary foundering of the sand-filled channels within slumped enveloping finer-grained slope sediments. The upper set of channels, dominated by one large sand and gravel-filled fairway, is characterized by large bedforms at the base, passing upwards into stacked conglomerates, mud chip breccias and sandstones.

However, a discontinuity has been shown to exist in the shape of laminated strata including the late Messinian brackish/lacustrine ""Lago Mare"" biofacies. More recently, Benson and Rakic-El Bled (1991) concluded that the section is still one of the best biostratigraphic successions for the western Mediterranean in which to document terminal Miocene events, but that it entirely has an early hnessinian age (i.e. it antedates deposition of the main evaporites). This paper presents strontium isotope ages indicating that the ""classic"" threefold division in an earlier marine Messinian, a ""Lago Mare"", and a Pliocene interval (sensu Geerlings et al., 1980; Cita et al., 1980) should be maintained. Moreover, the Sr isotopic composition of the euryhaline Cyprideis ostracodes from the ""Lago Mare"" laminites is similar to those from central Mediterranean basins. This stresses the importance of late Messinian water exchange between the Vera Basin and the then enclosed Mediterranean. It thus refutes the opinion of Benson and Rakic-EI Bied (1991) that this interval is a local facies, of no particular stratigraphic importance. A time gap of up to similar to 0.8 Ma between the youngest marine strata of the Messinian and the overlying Pliocene provides a maximum timing for the duration of the Messinian salinity crisis during which very little net sedimentation occurred, compared to coeval deposits in, for example, the nearby Nijar and Sorbas basins. In the Cuevas section an inconspicuous, and hitherto overlooked, erosional gap has been observed. This separates the ""Lago Mare"" marls from the Pliocene marls. More field observations have been made and are discussed in the light of existing interpretations, in order to demonstrate the importance of more widespread erosion in the Vera Basin. Gypsum-containing mass-flow deposits, filling up a late Messinian palaeorelief in the Garrucha area, are shown to be derived from the basin. These probably continue offshore as feeder channels related to a late Messinian sea-level fall. A holistic approach of a key section, thereby not overlooking the regional geology, is a necessary step to be made before far-reaching claims can be made about its interregional significance.",,

Sequence 1 consists of bioturbated inner-middle shelf packstones and wackestones (lower Burdigalian), resting unconformably on the silty slope facies sediments of the Marne di Antognola Fm. In this sequence the benthic foraminiferal assemblages, dominated by epifaunal and epiphytic taxa, indicate a well-oxygenated substratum within the photic zone. Climatic indices, among the planktonic foraminifera, suggest cool-temperate climate conditions. These sediments likely record the Burdigalian transgression at the beginning of the TB2 supercycle, as defined by Haq et al. (1987). Sequence 2 includes two superimposed units. The lower unit (upper Burdigalian) consists of rhodalgal rudstones and packstones of shelf environment with a mobile substrate and well-oxygenated water, rich in benthic foraminifera and Corallinaceae, deposited in warm-temperate conditions. A drowning unconformity surface bounds this unit from the second and reflects a relative sea-level rise that could be correlated with the maximum flooding surface within the cycle TB2.2. The upper unit (upper Burdigalian-lower Langhian) consists of foraminifera and glaucony-rich packstones ranging from inner shelf environment, characterized by epiphytic foraminifera and Miogypsinids, to outer shelf environment suggested by the increase of planktonic and benthic deep-water taxa and rhodoliths, deposited in warm-temperate conditions. This succession grades upward to upper Langhian-lower Serravallian planktonic foraminifer-rich marls of the Mincengo Fm. . Deposition of the carbonate sediments of the Sequence 2 is linked to the combined effect of: (1) tectonic reorganization of the basin; (2) sea level oscillations; (3) upwelling of nutrient-rich waters; (4) increase of trophic resources connected to increasing erosion of uplifted alpine relieves, favoring the development of “temperate-type” rhodalgal-foramol facies, similar to the coeval carbonate deposits reported in many places of the Mediterranean area.

 Loam (WSL, pH 6.46) from Washington. Potassium nitrate (KNO3), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) or urea ((NH)2CO) sources were evaluated for ammonia volatilization at 75 kg N ha−1 rate. The soil water regime was maintained at either 20 or 80% of field capacity (FC), and incubated at 11, 20 or 29°C. Results
 indicated that NH3 volatilization rate at 20% FC was 2 to 3-fold greater than that at 80% FC. The cumulative volatilization loss over 28 days
 ranged from 0.21% of N applied as NH4NO3 to 25.7% as (NH4)2SO4. Results of this study demonstrate that NH3 volatilization was accelerated at the low soil water regime. Moisture quotient (Q) is defined as a ratio of NH3 emission rate at 20% FC to that at 80% FC both at the same temperature. The peak Q values of NH3 volatilization were up to 20.8 for the BMS soil at 20°C, 112.9 for the KGL soil at 29°C, 19.0 for the QFS soil at 20°C, and
 74.1 for the WSL soil at 29°C, respectively. Thus, maintaining a suitable soil water regime is important to minimize N-loss
 via NH3 volatilization and to improve N uptake efficiency and air quality.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/57/8F/EC/578FEC1A0395D4765AD874C80956A1DC.pdf

Spoken language, however, drastically reduces morpho-syntactic marling (as shown, e.g., by the depronominalization of the relative marker and by quesuismo), while at the same time simplifying the semantic compatibility relations with the antecedent (extending, e.g., the use of donde 'where'). We propose to analyse native speakers' and language learners' errors, including those stemming from hypercorrection, in order to find out which are the prevailing relativization strategies. The tension between grammatical economy and communicative efficiency explains the fluctuation between simplification, on the one hand, characterized by the loss of prepositions and by the use of marked relative forms (e.g. cuyo 'whose'), and on the other, the recovery of information, e.g. through the use of resumptive pronouns.

Thereby, it will extend and complement a recent previous study carried out in the Northern Navarra. This paper aim to collect, analyse and evaluate the ethnobotanical knowledge about medicinal plants in the Riverside of Navarra (Iberian Peninsula) with 2554.4 km 2 and 144,674 inhabitants. Material and methods We performed semi-structured interviews with 147 informants (mean age 76 years; the percentage of men and women was almost 50%) in 34 locations, identified the plants reported and analyzed the results, comparing them with those from other territories. Results The informants reported data on 90 medicinal plants belonging to 39 botanical families. This work is focused on human medicinal plant uses, which represent 99% of the pharmaceutical uses (541). The species with the highest number of cites are Santolina chamaecyparissus ssp. squarrosa , Thymus vulgaris , Rosmarinus officinalis and Urtica dioica . All different plant parts are used; aerial part is exploited more frequently than other plant parts. Most of the listed remedies use a single ingredient, typically soaked in water. The percentage of internal uses is three times higher than external uses. Conclusions The main ailments treated are digestive troubles, dermatological problems, and respiratory affections. Informants reported 11 new or scarcely cited uses for 8 medicinal plants. For 50% of the species (4) we have not found bibliographical references in the scientific literature and 50% have only one or two references. Keywords Medicinal plants Traditional knowledge Ethnopharmacology The South of Navarra Spain 1 Introduction Navarra is a territory of 10,421 km 2 placed to the North of the Iberian Peninsula, where three zones can be differed: the Mountain on the North, the Riverside on the South, and both separated by a zone of transition, the Middle Navarra. The Riverside embraces 2554 km 2 and the geomorphology is based on marls and limestone marls with sandstones, gradually yielding to gypsum, gravel, sand and mud which predominate in broad, windswept plains that have been eroded over the course of time ( Gobierno de Navarra, 1997 ). This area is divided into two agricultural regions ( Fig. 1 ): High Riverside (Ribera estellesa, C6: 1225 km 2 ) and Low Riverside (Ribera tudelana, C7: 1329 km 2 ). The seasonal-rainfall Mediterranean bioclimate ( López et al., 2005 ), characterized by seasonal drought (favouring species that are specifically Mediterranean), occupies most of the territory, although there is also a small island of xeric Mediterranean (Bardenas Reales, an area declared a Biosphere reserve by UNESCO on 7 November 2000). The vegetation is obviously conditioned by this kind of bioclimate. The landscape is characterized by intensive agriculture, 70% of the suface ( Peralta, 1997, 2002 ). However, it is possible to find small masses of natural vegetation of holm-oak ( Quercus ilex L. ssp. ballota (Desf.) Samp.), aleppo pine ( Pinus halepensis Miller) as well as plantations of aleppo pine and black poplar ( Populus nigra L.). In addition, riparian vegetation with Alnus Mill., Salix L. and Populus L. populations is near the rivers. Shrubs ( Quercus coccifera L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Genista scorpius (L) DC. and Thymus vulgaris L.), and pastures ( Brachypodium retusum Beauv. and Lygeum spartium L.) are the most frequent. Navarra is officially divided in three linguistic areas, Basque-speaking zone, mixed zone and non Basque-speaking area ( Zabaleta, 1997 ). The studied region is included into the non Basque-speaking zone. The population is around 144,674 inhabitants. C7 region, with 58,401 inhabitants, is the most populated area due to Tudela (its population is around 35,000) is situated in. Tudela, the capital of the Riverside, is the second city of Navarra ( Instituto de Estadística de Navarra, 2008 ). Populations are big, with high distance between them, and people work in agriculture and/or industry mainly. In the last decades, ethnobotanical studies among surviving rural populations in industrialized countries have received growing attention. Many ethnobotanical surveys have been carried out in different areas of the Iberian Peninsula, because a high biological and cultural diversity ( Cavero et al., 2010 and references therein). In Navarra, despite the long tradition of biodiversity and ethnographic studies carried out ( Etniker-Euskalerria, 2004 ), the ethnobotanical value has not received attention, except for some data recently published by our investigation group ( Akerreta et al., 2007a,b, 2010; Cavero et al., 2010 ). To fill this gap, we analyzed the local traditional use (medicinal, veterinary, domestic and food purposes) of wild plants. Specifically, we aimed to compile an ethnobotanical inventory of both past and current uses, assuming that cultural and biological diversities are strongly interrelated and that people living in this area could still retain traditional uses disappeared elsewhere. In this frame, the main aims of the present paper are (i) to contribute to the diffusion of results from the study on the Riverside of Navarra to the scientific community, keeping in mind to open a door for researches on other disciplines and other works (ii) to do a quantitative assessment of the data obtained, comparing with similar studies in other territories, and (iii) to look for vascular plants which have not been previously cited or with scarce previous report on medicinal uses, that might be evaluated in further pharmacological studies. The authors are processing a similar paper titled “Pharmaceutical ethnobotany in the Middle Navarra” to cover all the territory. Comparisons between different zones of Navarra will be later established. 2 Methodology 2.1 Field studies Field and laboratory work began on 2003 and lasted until September 2007. Information was collected using semi-structured ethnobotanical interviews ( Akerreta et al., 2010; Cavero et al., 2010 ). A total of 147 informants were interviewed in 34 locations ( Fig. 1 ). Of those the percentage of men and women was almost 50% (73 men and 74 women). The ages ranged from 22 to 100 year, and mean age are 76 years, value higher than in Northern Navarra ( Cavero et al., 2010 ). In the field work for each species the following data were noted: the local name, place, collection method, drying and preservation system, parts or organs used, method of preparation, dosage, and administration. Plant vouchers were collected, mostly in collaboration with the informants, and authenticated according to Flora Iberica ( Castroviejo, 1986–2005 ) and Flora of the Basque Country ( Aizpuru et al., 2003 ). These vouchers were deposited in the PAMP Herbarium at the School of Science (University of Navarra). After all the information was compiled, a database in Microsoft Access ® was prepared to relate information concerning taxa and their uses, bibliographic references, and the interviewees. 2.2 Data analyses I/P index (number of interview/population of the territory, in percentage) is calculated in order to know if the number of informants is suitable to the scientific validity of results obtained. The minimal number of surveys for a territory in Southern Europe is 0.10% ( Muntané, 2005 ). The population interviewed overcomes this minimum in C6 (0.16%). Nevertheless, in C7, the value is lower (0.06%) due to: (i) the presence of Tudela, the second city with major population of Navarra and, (ii) an important part of the region is constituted by the Bardenas Reales, Biosphere Reserve (45,500 hectares of terrain without inhabitants). The Bardenas Reales, as an ancient royal possession, are not part of any municipal term and are administered directly by the Navarra government. Muntané (2005) used this index for rural zones, big urban areas were not considered; for this reason the number of interviews in the study is suitable in order to obtain results with scientific validity. The accumulation or saturation curves ( Cavero et al., 2010 ) show that the number of informants (147) is enough to confirm that the sample of interviewed population has a sufficient size. The curves are levelled with 80 (C6) and 40 informants (C7). To confirm the degree of originality and novelty of the uses claimed by the informants, they are compared with those reported in more than 250 works on ethnobotany, economic botany, medicinal plants and phytotherapy, mainly ( Akerreta, 2009 , and new references published until nowadays). The plant uses with less of three references are considered as very scarcely reported. Quantitative ethnobotany calculations are performed, allowing us discussing the results and their novelty value comparing with other studies. The following indices are calculated: use values (UV), number of medicinal plants/km 2 , per inhabitant and per informant; and finally the informant consensus factor (FIC) ( Cavero et al., 2010 , for details). 3 Results and discussion A total of 541 pharmaceutical uses are reported from the informants, 99% refer to human medicinal uses belonging to 90 plants (85% native and 15% introduced species from other continents, or other European regions). The complete catalogue of the ethnoflora of the surveyed territory is given in Akerreta (2009) . 3.1 Botanical analyses: families, species and parts of the plants The 90 medicinal plants belong to 39 families, mainly represented by Compositae (20%), Labiatae (12%), Rosaceae (11%), Leguminosae (4%), and Umbelliferae and Urticaceae (3%, each one). The first three families are equally well represented throughout the Iberian Peninsula, and also constitute the major groups of medicinal plant in most of the works that are consulted ( Neves et al., 2009; Benitez et al., 2010; Cavero et al., 2010; González et al., 2010 ). According to the number of given uses, Compositae (35%), Labiatae (15%), Liliaceae (8%), Urticaceae (7%), Rosaceae (6%) and Malvaceae (5%) are the most represented family. ICF's high value (0.83) indicates the great uniformity in the use of some species to treat diseases; if certain plants are effective, there is not need to go looking for others ( Mesa-Jiménez, 1996; Heinrich et al., 1998 ). Table 1 shows a summary of the top 16 vascular plants with traditional phytotherapeutical use: they are the most reported species, the ones that also present a very high number of uses, high number of informants, its use values and a wide diversity range of medical uses. It is worth mentioning these plants, despite they are quite common and very often reported in ethnopharmacological papers, because they provide a good idea of the basic and more rooted ethnobotanical knowledge of the area studied; also, the most original medicinal plant uses in the region prospected, i.e. those not or scarcely previously reported, is presented in Table 2 . The parts of the plant primarily used are the aerial part (44%) and the floral structures (26%) while the leaves (13%) and fruits (9%), are also frequently used. Other parts used are roots and bulb (8%), and occasionally the whole plant and seeds (1%, each one). These percentages are similarly found in other areas ( Agelet and Vallès, 1999; Bonet and Vallès, 2007; Benitez et al., 2010 ) and consistent with the data obtained for parts of plants used in other regions of Navarra ( Cavero et al., 2010 ). Generally, these parts facilitate plant identification and present less difficulties on collection and conservation methods. 3.2 Methods of drug preparation and administration Plants used in traditional remedies are prepared and administered in different forms. The percentage of internal uses is three times higher than external uses (75%, 25%, respectively). These results are different in comparison with the Northern Navarra, where the climate is humid and dermatological affections are frequent ( Cavero et al., 2010 ). The plants are consumed fresh (44%), dry (41%) or indistinctly (11%); different forms of uses of some plants are forgotten (3%). For internal use, tisanes (infusions 62%, decoction 16%) are far followed by maceration with anisette, direct administration or comestible and vapours (5%, each one). The most important forms of preparation for external uses are poultices (30%), direct administration (23%), and ointments (13%); in lower proportion, baths and alcohol maceration (8%, 7%, respectively). It is difficult to establish a quantitative formulation of remedies, because dosages are not always known (or only approximately given, almost never in units such as grams). 3.3 Main affections treated The most treated illnesses or troubles we group in 12 pathological groups. Other group is also considerate: “various” in which the use-reports of unspecified diseases appear; and “magical” medicinal uses ( Tables 1 and 2 ). We found 218 (37%) remedies to treat digestive problems (digestive, carminative, diarrhoea, evil tripe, laxative, purgative, stomach ache, to be a had mood); 90 (15%) remedies to cure dermatological problems (furuncles, burn, acne, skin ulcers and cracks, warts, chilblains, herpes, skin spots, and wounds); 86 (14%) remedies for respiratory tract infections (cough, sore-throat, cold, and catarrh). 57 (11%) remedies to cardio-vascular conditions (hypertension, to purify or clean the blood, diuretic, Anti-haemorrhoidal -piles-, for blood circulation); other remedies are mainly used to nervous system (28 remedies, 5%) and joints and rheumatism (22 remedies, 4%). Digestive and dermatologic problems are also the most cited in similar studies ( González-Tejero, 1989; Mulet, 1991; Heinrich et al., 1998; Bonet et al., 1999; Camejo-Rodrigues et al., 2003; Macía et al., 2005; Libman et al., 2006; Aburjai et al., 2007; Cavero et al., 2010 ). Teas and chamomiles for digestive remedies: there are two groups of species, one with names derived from “manzanilla” or “chamomile” and other one from “té” (tea). Santolina chamaecyparissus ssp. squarrosa is the most cited plant (76 uses); other “manzanillas” are Helichrysum stoechas (20 uses), Chamomilla recutita (4 uses) and Chamaemelum nobile (2 uses). The same species has been cited by Pardo de Santayana and Morales (2006, 2010) . On the other hand, attention should be focused on the use of plants popularly known as “té”, which correctly refers to Jasonia glutinosa and Jasonia tuberosa (10 uses, each one). Bidens aurea (9 uses) is a tea which is known today only in a few places in the south of Navarra. A native of Central America, it was brought back by a missionary friar many decades ago, according to our interview data. It used to be grown, but now occurs as an invader in irrigation channels ( Pardo de Santayana et al., 2005; Akerreta et al., 2007a,b ). In addition, Glycyrrhiza glabra as carminative and Prunus spinosa for stomach ache (10 uses, each one) are two frequently used species. The most usual method of preparation with the fresh fruits of Prunus spinosa is maceration with anisette (with a use entirely internal and digestive), as in the case of the preparation called ‘patxaran’, the most famous and characteristic liquor not only in this region but also of Navarra as a whole ( Akerreta et al., 2007a,b; Cavero et al., 2010 ). Urtica dioica is one of the most mentioned plants ( Table 1 , 32 uses, 1.2 UV) for alterations of the circulatory system (15 uses) and respiratory affections (3 uses). In this study many plants are used in cataplasms, direct applications and ointments for skin problems: Allium cepa (19 uses) and Hylotelephium maximum (13 uses). The pathologies treated with Malva sylvestris and Thymus vulgaris were mainly gastrointestinal diseases (including those of animals) and respiratory affections, in accordance to many other studies ( De Natale and Pollio, 2007; Cornara et al., 2009; Neves et al., 2009; Idolo et al., 2010 ). At present, 10 plants are collected for their use in cookery. Among them 9 species are reported also for therapeutic use: Foeniculum vulgare and Taraxacum officinale as depurative; Origanum vulgare ssp. virens , O. vulgare ssp. vulgare , T. officinale , Thymus vulgaris and Laurus nobilis , for digestive problems; and Allium sativum is consumed in salad as flavouring, to rheumatism and arthritis. Medicago sativa is used only as food. Some of these uses have been previously reported ( Vitalini et al., 2009 ) 3.4 Quantitative ethnobotany Quantitative data collection from ethnobotanical studies is turning to be essential for carrying out more solid comparisons between other ethnobotany works that use the same methodology ( Hoffman and Gallaher, 2007; Tardío and Pardo de Santayana, 2008; Parada et al., 2009 ). Table 3 shows some quantitative data on medicinal plants from 32 regions of the Iberian territories, including the two in the present study (Riverside: C6 and C7). The number of informants for this study (253), the number of medicinal plants reported (90), value of medicinal plants per informant (0.61), medicinal plants/km 2 (0.03) and per inhabitant (6.22 × 10 −4 ) is calculated. Comparisons of these results with other similar works in the Iberian Peninsula showed lower values due to: (i) 70% of these regions are focused to intensive agricultural fields and related industries; (ii) presence of Tudela and the Bardenas Reales. These facts influence directly in the loss of habitats, traditional practices and traditional culture, reasons that might explain these values. 3.5 New or scarcely reported medicinal plants Informants reported 11 scarcely cited plant uses for 8 species (9% of total) which are mentioned as medicinal. These plants are compiled in Table 2 , which includes, apart from plant nomenclature, plant activities as claimed by the informants, followed by the therapeutical category in brackets, and references. Moreover, their ways of preparation and administration are also referred. For 50% of the species (4) we have not found scientific references: Potentilla reptans to treat the piles, Cardus pycnocephalus ssp. pycnocephalus to cure wounds, Pelargonium sp. to constipation, Petroselinum crispum as abortive. The other four species have only one or two references. The “magical” medicinal category includes, according to our interpretation, remedies not explained on the basis of pharmaceutical properties of the plant but rather on an intense faith in the fulfilment of its mission. In many cases, there is no ingestion of the plant or even topical contact. In this type of magical ritual, the use of Potentilla reptans as antihaemorrhoidal is reported; the fresh plant is kept in a bag in the belief that when dries it cures the haemorrhoids. This has no scientific basis nowadays, but folklore continues to give equal importance to both conceptions of illness and remedy. Another interesting species reported by 4 informants is Foeniculum vulgare : the fresh plant is boiled and eaten to clean the body (depurative). The scarce references show that these plants could be interesting for future studies. 3.6 Other information Non-medicinal information concerning the use of 6 species has been reported. Informants use Juniperus oxycedrus and Quercus ilex ssp. ballota as wood for fires at home in winter. Foeniculum vulgare is used to aromatize the barrel of wine; Lavandula latifolia to make colony; the fruits of Rubus ulmifolius boiled and crushed as ink to write; and Arctium minus to dye one's hair black. 4 Concluding remarks The present study adds to the ethnobotanical map of the Riverside Navarra, an important number of species and medicinal uses. The pathologies treated by these plants are not serious, involving mainly the digestive, dermal and respiratory systems. The families that added the highest number of medicinal species to the ethnobotanical catalogue are Compositae and Labiatae . We analyse the factors underlying the high use of plants from these two families. The species most referenciated are Santolina chamaecyparissus ssp. squarrosa , Thymus vulgaris , Rosmarinus officinalis and Urtica dioica . The transmission of knowledge from the old to the new generation is declining. The medicinal plant harvesting is a tradition that younger generation are losing. Only elderly people still use traditional medicine for the treatment of different diseases remembering several methods of remedy preparation, but most of them prefer the orthodox medicine. The preserved ethnobotanical knowledge was based on the collective tradition and the memories of their parents and grandparents. Our work can be an aid to prevent from totally losing the ethnobotanical traditions of the Riverside Navarra and to stress the need to safeguard its plant biodiversity. It is, in fact, a rare and precious natural heritage to be protected for the future generations. Further studies on phytochemical and biological activity should also be conducted on the reported medicinal plants of this area so as to utilize them in drug development.

Convolute structures are exposed in interfingering shallow lacustrine, beach and fluvial sediments. Other deformational structures we encountered exist as marl intrusions in coarse pebbly sand whereby the latter progresses upward making a sort of pillars. We used seven field criteria for relating soft sediment deformation to paleoseismic triggering which provide strong evidence for the seismic origin of the structures: (1) proximity to active seismic zones; (2) potentially liquefiable composition of sediments which are soft metastable sand and low-cohesion clay; (3) similarity to structures formed experimentally and those produced by natural seismic shaking; (4) absence of detectable effects of slope instability (gravity sliding); (5) stratigraphic position of deformation units between undeformed sediments; (6) lateral extent and regional abundance of deformational structures correlated over large areas; (7) cyclic repetition of structures in the section. We infer from empirical relationships between earthquake magnitude and the maximum epicentral distance to liquefaction sites that deformation was most likely associated with events in the highly seismic active epicentral zone north of Lake Issyk-Kul'. The earthquake-induced deformational structures record high seismic activity already in the Middle Pleistocene.",,

The geological features (sinclinal structure, faults, hydrogeological conditions, extension of the “Tripoli” marl strata) which had an important role in the formation of the slide, as well as the means of marl exploitation by means of mass blasting, are presented in the paper. The Kostanjek slide involves an urbanized area of some 100 ha. It is estimated that a sliding mass of some 32 × 106 m3 is involved, with a maximum depth of 90 m. Sliding occurs in three levels. The displacements of the surface are 3–6 m. The excavation of marl was stopped in 1988, when a total of 5.3 × 106 m3 of material was excavated. Since then the magnitude of surface displacement per year has decreased. The Kostanjek slide is still active. It is estimated that natural stabilization will take a long time, probably decades. Analyses of possible measures for the stabilization of movements suggested that preventive drainage with continuous observation of the slide is most suitable.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/F6/39/8B/F6398B7B90A99C5474E5B14EBA96AD36.pdf

The sections are arranged along a depth transect (similar to50-600 m) across an epicontinental basin covering Egypt and Israel. This study is aimed at unraveling paleoceanographic changes associated with the late Paleocene thermal maximum. In three sections (similar to200-600 m paleodepth), black shales, consisting of dark brown laminated marls with as much as 2.7% total organic carbon (TOC), mark the late Paleocene thermal maximum. The black shales of the deeper sites correlate with pink to gray fissile marls in the shallowest section. In the two remaining sections, this stratigraphic interval is missing. A relative sea-level fall (similar to30 m) immediately preceded the late Paleocene thermal maximum, during which sea-level rose again by similar to20 m. This rise may have been eustatically controlled, possibly through a combination of thermal expansion of the oceanic water column and melting of unknown sources of high-altitude or polar ice caps in response to global warming. During the late Paleocene thermal maximum, the upwelling of low-oxygen intermediate Tethyan water into the epicontinental basin led to enhanced biological productivity and anoxia at the seafloor. Before and after the late Paleocene thermal maximum, upwelling and biological productivity were less intense, and seafloor dysoxia was restricted to neritic parts of the basin. The presence of similar TOC-rich beds in extensive areas in southern Asia indicates that the Tethyan continental margins may have acted as significant carbon sinks during the late Paleocene thermal maximum.",,

They form the Ahlat - Adilcevaz complex, which is composed of ophiolites, conglomerates, sandstones, marls, shaly limestones, limestones, pyroclastics and reefs. Over this complex lies, unconformably, the continental Ahlat conglom- erate, possibly of Eocene-Oligoc ene age. Lower Miocene Sediments are represented by the transgressive Adilcevaz limestone, mainly Burdigalian in age. The Adilcevaz limestone is unconformably overlain by the Aktaş conglomerate and by the Develik formation, which is composed of sandy, marly and shaly Sediments. The Develik formation is conformably overlain by the Çukurtarla limestone, of lacustrine Origin. These three formations range in age from Middle Miocene to Lovver Pliocene. The Quaternary deposits are represented by travertine, terrace deposits and new alluvium. Large portions of the area are covered by different kinds of lavaş and pyroclastic rocks, late Cenozoic in age. The structure of the area is mainly characterized by the Ahlat-Adilcevaz uplift; its axis trends NE-SW. During the Upper Cretaceous times, the area was under geosynclinal conditions, while, in the Eocene-Oligocene times continental conditions prevailed. A regional marine transgression took place at the beginning of the Miocene epoque; the sea withdrew from the area at the end of this epoque.",,

Lower-Middle Jurassic glaucony-bearing deposits crop out in the Polish part of the Krizna Unit in the Western Tatra Mts. These deposits, up to 20 cm thick, consist of glaucony-rich marls and limestones. The glaucony grains constitute up to 30% volume of the deposits. They represent an evolved stage of glauconitization since they contain more than 7% K2O. The content of AI2O3 is high (up to 19.97%, average 16.98%) while the content of Fe2C>3 is low' (not more than 23.48%, average 12.84%). These features are interpreted as a product of diagenetic processes. The glaucony-bearing deposits were formed at an upper bathyal depth and their rate of deposition was very low, what allowed long-lasting evolution of the glaucony grains. The K-Ar age of the glaucony grains is much younger than the biostratigraphic age of the studied section. The lowering of the K-Ar dates is interpreted as a result of loss of radiogenic Ar from the lattice of the glaucony.",,

Neither for the siderite, nor for the calcite concretions a petrographic, mineralogical, or stable isotope trend from the center to the margin of the concretions was observed, implying that the concretions grew pervasively. The delta C-13 values of the Gams siderite concretions (-11.1 to -7.5%) point to microbial respiration of organic carbon and the delta O-18 values (-3.5 to + 2.2%) are in accordance with a marine depositional environment. The low delta C-13 values (-6.8 to-4.2%) of the Steinbrunn calcite concretions most likely reflect a combination of bacterial organic matter oxidation and input of marine biodetrital carbonate. The corresponding delta O-18 values (-8.8 to-7.9%) agree with carbonate precipitation in a meteoric environment or fractionation in the course of bacterial sulfate reduction. Lipid biomarkers have been extracted before and after decalcification of the concretions in order to assess pristine signatures and to exclude secondary contamination. The siderite concretions did not yield indigenous biomarkers due to their high thermal maturity. The calcite concretions comprise abundant plant wax-derived long-chain n-alkanes, reflecting high terrestrial input. Bacterial-derived, terminally-branched fatty acids and hopanoids were found, but with overall low contents. The presence of framboidal pyrite, the moderately low delta C-13 values, and the biomarker inventory indicate that bacterial-sulfate reduction contributed to the formation of the calcite concretions in a brackish environment. The low delta C-13 values of the siderite concretions, on the other hand, are best explained by bacterial iron reduction, since sulfate reduction and resultant hydrogen sulfide production would have inhibited siderite precipitation. This study documents a new example for an exception from the common pattern that siderite concretions preferentially precipitate in freshwater environments. The Gams siderite concretions formed within marine sediments, whereas the Steinbrunn calcite concretions formed in freshwater to brackish sediments.",,

The Ca-U(VI) oxides are associated with typical pyrometamorphic minerals, such as sulfate- bearing fluorapatite, fluorellestadite, spurrite, fluormayenite, dorrite, brownmillerite, srebrodolskite, periclase (Zn-, Ni-, Co-, and Cu-rich), lime, and U-rich lakargiite. The primary Ca-U(VI) oxide minerals have large compositional ranges, with 45.07 to 82.54 wt.% UO3 and 16.66 to 56.05 wt.% CaO corresponding to CaO-to-UO3 molar ratios from 1 to 6. The marble-hosted calcium uranate minerals are most often Ca3UO6 or Ca2UO5 existing as individual crystals (5 to 25 mu m), while CaUO4 is a rarer phase found as small inclusions in fluorapatite/fluorellestadite. These compounds were identified by SEM microscopy, electron microprobe analyses, and Raman spectroscopy. The existence of other calcium uranate minerals (Ca4UO7, Ca5UO8, Ca3U2O9, and Ca6UO9) has been inferred from SEM and electron microprobe analyses of single grains (< 10 aem). The mineral assemblages correspond to high-temperature (ca. 800-850 C) and ambient pressure conditions of spurrite-merwinite metamorphic subfacies. The Ca-U(VI) oxide minerals formed during Quaternary combustion metamorphism of U-rich bituminous calcareous sediments (oil shales of the Maastrichtian-Paleocene Muwaqqar Chalk Marl Formation, Belqa Group). Numerous pseudomorphs after cracked and hydrated calcium uranate grains with a wide range of impurities (Si, Fe, Al, and F) may be due to chemical weathering and hydration of the primary calcium uranate minerals. A more hydrous analogue of the so-called x-phase (Ca(2)UO(5)1.5-3H(2)O) was found as a main secondary phase after the primary Ca-U (VI) oxide minerals.

Described since the XVIIIth Century they belong to the 'Molasse a Charbon', a detritic formation essentially composed of dark marls, limestones and rare coal seams with some channelized sandstone bodies. The coal, which was exploited until the Second World War, provides most of the fossil assemblages. The rare outcrops that still exist along the Paudeze River are very important for their sedimentological information and the recovery of new microfossil assemblages. 'Rochette' assemblages are dominated by Anthracotherids-Turtles-Crocodiles (fauna) and Charophytes-Cyperoids-Lygodium (flora). Several curious aspects of these fossils include the presence of giant forms of Charophyta, the importance of Lygodium leaves without arborescent plant support, and the abundance of large vertebrates. The comparison between macrofauna, microfauna, leaves, fruits, seeds and palynomorphs demonstrates that different taphonomic processes occurred. The geologic and paleontologic data allow the reconstruction of the sedimentological, ecological and climatic conditions during the late Oligocene. The Paudeze basin was a large cyperoid-Lygodium wetland with ox-bow lakes. Meandering rivers originating in the mountains transported some rare arborescent elements into the basin. Some of the pollen grains (especially the bisaccates) are considered to have been transported from high altitudes by wind. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",,

Slovenian coast consists of 47 kilometers of mostly steep, abrasive marl and sandstone coast. Low accumulation coast is located only at the mouths of the watercourses and represents but a smaller portion, whereas the smallest part is occupied by the limestone abrasion coast. Mainland coastal region is mostly hillside and has a very diverse relief, while plains, in smaller numbers, are located only in the lower parts of the river valleys. Slovenian sea indents the mainland by two larger gulfs: the Gulf of Koper and of Piran and is predominately very shallow. The average depth is around 18 m and the largest depth is 38 m at the Madona cape near Piran. Sea bottom is mostly covered by the thick layer of sediments deposited after the abrasion of the steep cliff coast and by the accumulation of the river alluvium. Due to its shallowness the sea is exposed to high temperature fluctuations and due to the fresh water influx also to the changes of its salinity. The circulation of the sea water is mainly induced by the tide and wind activities, mostly the Bora (strong north-easterly wind) which significantly influences the vertical circulation of the water. Water current is weak and unstable. There is a large influx of nutrients into the Slovenian sea, resulting from the soil erosion, surface water influx, watercourses and direct emissions of waste waters into the sea. The consequence of the mentioned sea characteristics is a great landscape sensitivity of the coastal sea ecosystem. During summer the sea warms intensely and when accompanied by the weak water circulation, we are often witnessing the lack of oxygen in the deeper layers of the water, intensive algae growth and sea blooming, which points to exceeded self-cleaning (assimilation) capacities of the marine ecosystem. The major polluters are the coastal towns of: Koper, Izola, Piran and Portorož, nautical tourism with marines, naval traffic and the port activity of the Luka Koper. The pressures on the marine ecosystem due to the human activities are still increasing, both on the mainland and in the sea, despite some measures to reduce the pollution.

6229723b5aee126c0f739e69,Estimation of recession curve of karst spring hydrograph: example of the spring Gradole,,"[{'name': 'Vesna Denić-Jukić'}, {'name': 'Kristina Kuštera'}, {'name': 'Damir Jukić'}]","The spring Gradole represents a typical karst spring of the rising type, which is situated in central part of Istria (Croatia). The drainage area is composed mostly of carbonate rocks (limestone) and partly of flysch components (marls and sandstones). The average altitude of the catchment area is approximately 330 m a.s.l. Strong tectonic deformations have made carbonate deposits very permeable, enabling the infiltration of water. The average rainfall is between 1046 and 1120 mm. The catchment area of the spring is estimated to approximately 114 km2. Several studies have shown that the recession curves of karst spring hydrographs characterize the storage properties of karst aquifers. The change in slope can be explained with the drainage of different types of media typical for karst, such as conduits, fractures, pores and fissures. The main factors that affect the recession curve are aquifer lithology and geometry of conduits. Consequently, the recession curve analyzes can provide information about the aquifer and the main features of karst rock massif. Usually, the recession curves can be fitted well by the function that consists of two or more exponential terms with exponential coefficients 1, 2, . . . , where the lower coefficient 1 represents the slow flow through porous medium or base flow. The recession curve that represents base flow is usually named as the master recession curve and its exponential coefficient 1 is named as the master recession coefficient. In this study, classical methods for estimation of recession curve are applied to the hydrograph of the spring Gradole. The results are compared with those obtained by applying Composite Transfer Functions (CTF). Differently from classical parametric and nonparametric transfer functions that represent the quick flow and base flow component of spring response by a single function, CTF represents the spring response by two functions adapted for the quick flow and the slow flow component. The quick flow component is represented by a nonparametric transfer function, whereas the slow flow component is represented by a parametric transfer function which is an Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH) formulated and defined mathematically from a conceptual model. By using CTF for Rainfall-Runoff (RR) modeling, the simulations of long recession periods as well as the simulations of complete hydrograph become more successful. If IUH defined from the conceptual model of linear reservoir is applied, the parametric transfer function representing slow flow component has exponential form. It means that the recession coefficient of IUH represents the master recession coefficient of the spring hydrograph, i.e. the recession coefficient of IUH can be determined by using classical methods for the estimation of master recession coefficient, and vice versa, the problem of determination of master recession coefficient can be transformed to the problem of determination of the recession coefficient of IUH. The recession coefficient of IUH is determined simultaneously with the values of nonparametric transfer function in the optimization procedure for estimation of parameters of RR model based on CTF. The recession coefficients of IUH are obtained separately in the optimization procedures for each hydrological year during the period 1987-2002. The results show that the recession curve of the spring Gradole has not a unique form. Depending on hydrological year, the obtained nonparametric transfer functions representing quick flow component can be fitted by one or two exponential terms. The values of master recession coefficient vary between 100 and 260 days. The average value for the entire period of 15 years is 140 days. These results are similar to the results obtained by applying classical methods for estimation of master recession curve. It confirms practically that the recession coefficient of IUH can be estimated from the spring hydrograph, which can be useful for RR modeling based on CTF because the number of unknown parameters is reduced.",,
5f0e70349fced0a24b1d05b2,IADC/SPE 128405 Salinity-Based Pump & Dump Strategy for Drilling Salt with Supersaturated Fluids,,[{'name': 'T. J. Akers'}],"Riserless drilling with weighted mud systems, commonly referred to as a ""Pump & Dump"" drilling strategy, is an established drilling technique used on deepwater wells with shallow hazards. Large holes and high flow rates result in very large volumes of fluid being required to drill to total depth (TD), circulate the well clean and cement the conductor casing string. Fluids management becomes a major issue in the riserless hole section. In the Gulf of Mexico, mud is often densified in excess of well requirements and then blended with seawater in a ""Cut-Back"" operation to reach the desired density to pump downhole. When riserless drilling into salt, a Pump & Dump strategy is often used. Dilution with seawater, however, results in an undersaturated fluid. This fluid leaches the salt resulting in substantial hole enlargement. The hole enlargement can result in poor cementing jobs that require remediation or even an additional string of casing. A unique operation has been employed in the Santos Basin of Brazil where a supersaturated brine fluid was used to conduct a pump & dump operation with the goal of drilling with a saturated brine fluid and minimizing hole enlargement. This paper details the planning of the operation, fluid design, and pilot testing. Fluids management, equipment rig up, and results are discussed in detail. The operation has been successfully executed twice with both operations achieving the set objectives for the wells. Unforeseen complications that were encountered are discussed along with lessons learned that have been applied to subsequent operations. Introduction The operator and co-venturers began exploration drilling on the block BM-S-22 in the offshore Santos Basin of Brazil in 2008. The location of the block is shown in Fig. 1. Water depths in the block range from 2100 to 2300 m. The entire block is thought to contain a thick layer of evaporite which overlies the prospective interval. The evaporite interval is encountered at approximately 600 to 1200 m below the mudline and consists of anhydrite and a variety of different salt chemicals including halite, carnalite, and tachyhydrite. A carbonate / anhydrite caprock of varying thickness overlies the evaporite. From the mudline to the caprock are sequences of soft to firm hemi-pelagic clays with intebedded silts, marls, and sands. The conductor casing on which the high-pressure wellhead housing is connected is normally set some distance below the top of the evaporite interval. A protective casing string is often set near the base of the evaporite before drilling the objective section found immediately below the evaporite. The intent of the protective casing is to both obtain an increased formation integrity test (FIT) before drilling the objective interval and to also case off the evaporite section which has been considered prone to salt creep. By placing the casing shoes in the evaporite interval, the well design can take advantage of the elevated shoe integrity afforded by the higher Poisson's ratio in the evaporite interval. On the exploration drilling program, the depth of the base of the evaporite was not known with certainty, and the risk existed of potentially drilling into the objective interval with only conductor casing set. For this reason, obtaining a high conductor casing shoe FIT is critical to the well's success. Available data from offset wells suggested the lack of consistent conductor casing shoe integrity tests. An offset with its conductor shoe 100 m below the top of evaporite may not have the shoe integrity of another offset with its shoe at a similar depth but only 50 m into the top of the evaporite. The operator concluded that it was not the formation that had variable integrity, but rather the quality of the cement jobs on the various wells. The most likely cause of poor cement job quality was thought to be borehole enlargement.",,
5f0e28fe9fced0a24b746fa0,Cement Production HIGHLIGHTS PROCESSES AND TECHNOLOGY,,"[{'name': 'Giorgio Simbolotti@enea It'}, {'name': 'Giancarlo  Tosato'}]","Cement Production HIGHLIGHTS  PROCESSES AND TECHNOLOGY STATUS – The manufacture of cement is a two-phase process. Clinker is first produced in a kiln system from calcareous (limestone, chalk or marl) and argillaceous (clay or shale) materials, with addition, in some cases, of small amounts of corrective materials (sand, waste bauxite, iron ore). Various fossil fuels and waste fuels are used in this process to reach the reaction temperature of 1450 °C. Secondly, the clinker is ground with calcium sulphates and with industrial processes wastes such as blast furnace slag, limestone, natural pozzolana and industrial pozzolanic materials, e.g. fly ash, silica fume and burnt shale. 90-150 kWh/t cement are used in the process. Two basic types of clinker production processes exist, depending on the way the row materials are prepared before entering the kiln system: in the wet method, water is added to form a wet thick slurry whereas the dry process is based on drying the bulk materials to form a dry powdered meal. The choice of process depends on moisture content of the available raw material. When wet raw materials (moisture content over 20%) are available, the wet process can be preferred. However, in Europe, today's new cement plants are all based on the dry process as the wet process requires approximately 56 to 66% more energy. For dry processes, current state-of-the-art technologies are kiln systems with multistage cyclone preheaters and precalciner. Capacities of up to 15,000 tonnes clinker per day are achievable and unit consumption as low as 3.3 GJ/t clinker. [IEA, 3] building a new plant with a capacity of 1 million tonnes/annum of cement using the conventional dry processes with 5-stage preheater and precalciner costs €263 per tonne/annum (€ 2010). The investment cost increases to some €558/t if CO 2 emissions produced in the process are captured (and stored) using post-combustion technologies and to €327/t using oxy-combustion technologies. According to the European Cement Research Academy [ECRA, 2] new plants with capacities of 2, 1 and 0.5 million tonnes per year, using state-of-the-art technologies the unit investment costs is €130, €170 and €250 per tonne/annum respectively (€ 2007). Operation and maintenance (O&M) costs (including labour, power and fuel costs, but no deprecation) amount to €29/t for new, state-of-the-art plants and to €32/t for a typical existing plant with no CO2 capture. O&M costs are estimated to rise to €66 and €45/t for plants equipped with post-combustion …",,

The $600+ million structure is supported on drilled shafts, which bear within the soils of the Cooper Group (colloquially known as the Cooper Marl). Geotechnical data necessary for foundation design were primarily obtained during three major site characterization programs performed for the preliminary design phases. The programs included soil test borings, cone penetration testing, shear wave velocity measurements, laboratory index testing, consolidation testing, and triaxial shear testing. The extensive data from these exploration efforts are summarized and evaluated. The Cooper Marl typically classifies as an overconsolidated (OCR of 3 to 6), highly plastic clay or silt with liquid limits often in excess of 100 and plasticity indices of more than 50. The fines content is generally in the range of 75% to 90% but the clay mineral content is small (< 10%) and the primary mineral constituent is calcium carbonate (60% to 80%). The calcium carbonate content is mainly in the form of the skeletal remains of microscopic marine organisms (e.g., foraminifera) and the fossiliferous nature of the particles is thought to explain the fact that the effective friction angle is typically in the range of 43 to 46 degrees. The void ratio is relatively high (I to 2) but the undrained shear strength is also high (140 kPa to 280 kPa) and the shear wave velocity (generally in the range of 400 m/s to 600 m/s) is relatively constant with depth; all of which indicate that the deposit is cemented.",,

This paper aims at a comprehensive description of these relatively unknown reservoirs and speculates on additional play potential outside of the current production areas. The Muschelkalk Formation consists of partially porous Lower and Upper Muschelkalk carbonates separated by tight Middle Muschelkalk evaporites. The 100 m thick Lower Muschelkalk holds 1.9 BCM gas in the De Wijk Field. The reservoir is a limestone–dolomite–marl succession producing from several decimetres thick calcisilitic dolo-mudstones encased in tight lime-mudstones. The reservoir shows a stratified architecture composed of 16 cycles with thin but laterally continuous porous units. Good reservoir quality facies are concentrated in the upper third of these cycles. Porosities vary from 6 to 27%, (average 12%) and permeabilities range from 0.01 to 32 mD (average 0.06 mD). The reservoir rocks represent inner ramp sediments of a storm-dominated epeiric ramp. The 50 m thick Upper Muschelkalk contains 0.8 BCM gas in the Coevorden Muschelkalk Field. The reservoir consists of several decimetres thick peloidal-oolitic dolo-grain to packstones of good permeability interbedded with lower permeability dolo-mudstones to wackestones. Porosity varies from 5 to 29% (average 15%) and permeability ranges from 0.01 to 57 mD (average 1 mD). The permeable dolo-grainstones occur chiefly around peak transgression and early regression of the Upper Muschelkalk. The producing Upper Muschelkalk deposits represent the inner ramp section of a storm-dominated homoclinal ramp. Numerous gas shows in the Lower and Upper Muschelkalk, scattered over the onshore territory of The Netherlands, suggest possible missed pay and upside potential. The highest reservoir potential occurs in grainy dolomitic inner ramp deposits. These are likely to be located close to the existing fields in the NE Netherlands. Additionally, currently unrecognized potential could be present in southern Germany and eastern Poland.",,

This model was known as a small brine-lake located in a big saline depression. The trace elements and the main elements in the evaporates of the Tertiary of Qaidam basin were presented. It was suggested that the evaporates were originated from the mixing of the river water and the deep brine, which came from the crust-cut faults in the basin. By strong evaporating, the mixed water was concentrated to deposit carbonates, including marls and calcareous shale, sulfates (e.g. gypsum, anhydrate) and chlorites such as halite in the saline lakes. There was a clear difference in the trace element compositions between calcareous shale deposited in the small brine-lake and in the big saline depression, which was sampled from wells drilled in the Tertiary of the western Qaidam basin. The difference approved that the small brine-lake was in a deep-water and strong reductive environment, and the big saline depression was in a shallow-water and less reductive lake. The deep brine came from the crust-cut fault was rich in the heavy metal trace elements and rare elements, which resulted in higher content of the elements in the sulfates and chlorites deposited in the small brine-lake than those in the carbonates deposited in the big saline depression. More than forty kinds of trace and rare elements in the evaporates were described, and the relation of the evaporates with oil source rocks was discussed.",,

The geochemical data indicate that the oil samples, with medium to high level of thermal maturity, have been generated from the anoxic marine marl/carbonate source rock(s). The Sargelu (Jurassic) and Garau (Cretaceous) formations are introduced as the main source rocks for the studied oils. The dendrogram obtained from the cluster analysis of high-resolution gas chromatography data introduces two main oil groups including Fahliyan reservoir, and Kazhdumi along with Sarvak/Gadvan reservoirs. This is confirmed by C7 Halpern star diagram, indicating that, the light oil fraction from Fahliyan reservoir is distinct from the others. Also, different pressure gradient of the Fahliyan Formation (over-pressured) relative to other reservoirs (normally-pressured) show the presence of compartments. The relation between toluene/n-heptane and n-heptane/methylcyclohexane represents the compartmentalization due to maturation/evaporative fractionation for Fahliyan and water washing for other studied reservoirs. Also, the impermeable upper part of the Fahliyan Formation and thin interbedded shaly layers in the Kazhdumi, Sarvak and Gadvan formations have controlled reservoir compartmentalization.",,https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/DC/EB/49/DCEB4991F5397C4CB689AD9104BA76A2.pdf
